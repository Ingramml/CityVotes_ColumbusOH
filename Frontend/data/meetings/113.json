The Development Project must have a minimum of 100 owner-occupied dwelling units; and\n\n2.       The Project Sponsor has committed to at least thirty percent (30%) of the owner-occupied units in the Development Project being Affordable Housing Units, meaning the units are occupied by the legal owner(s) of the unit, and whose annual household income is at or below one hundred and twenty percent (120%) of AMI and for which the annual cost of ownership does not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the household’s gross annual income. \n\n(b)    Form of Waiver of Application.
