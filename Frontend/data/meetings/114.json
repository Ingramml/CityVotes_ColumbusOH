The decision of the Housing Council shall be final and appealable pursuant to Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.\n\n(f)      Burden of Proof. Under this Section, the Project Sponsor bears the burden of demonstrating that a waiver of the affordability requirements for owner-occupied units satisfies the overall goals of this Chapter with regard to increasing the number of affordable housing units within the City and is in the best interests of the City.\n\n\nSECTION 6.  That existing Section 2 of Ordinance No. 3447-2023 is hereby repealed. \n\nSECTION 7.   That all sections of Ordinance No. 3447-2023 not repealed or amended herein remain in full force and effect.\n\nSECTION 8.
