Over the last five years, my office worked to create the first Columbus Youth Council;  spearheaded the effort to amplify and fund Deliver Black Dreams; expanded our City’s effort to protect immigrant and refugee families through the Columbus Families Together Fund; legislated policies intended to address housing insecurity with the Housing For All legislative package; advocated for public safety reforms with the Reimagining Safety Initiative; led and passed an effort to end the sale of flavored tobacco to stop the youth smoking epidemic; championed a reproductive justice legislative packaged; and led and passed the first common sense gun safety legislative package. \n\nAs you know, I have been elected to serve as the next Prosecutor in Franklin County, Ohio. I am excited about this opportunity and I’m looking forward to continuing my public service career in this new capacity. \n\nIt truly has been my honor and distinct pleasure to work with an amazing group of individuals who are committed to making Columbus a great city for all residents. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance in order to ensure a smooth transition of my responsibilities. \n\nSincerely,\n Shayla Favor\nFranklin County Prosecutor-Elect",
