        "title": "President Hardin stated that the first item of business for Council this evening is the appointment of a new member of Columbus City Council to fill the vacated seat of former President Pro Tem Elizabeth Brown and asked the City Clerk to read President Pro Tem Brown’s letter of resignation into the record.\r\n\r\nDecember 19, 2022\r\n\r\nCouncil President Shannon Hardin\r\nCity of Columbus\r\n90 W. Broad Street\r\nColumbus, OH, 43215\r\n\r\nDear Council President Hardin:\r\n\r\nPlease accept this letter as my formal resignation from my position as Council Member and President Pro Tempore of Columbus City Council on December 31st, 2022.\r\n\r\nIt is with deep gratitude that I reflect on the past seven years I have served with you on city council. Together, we opened up the capital budget process to be more inclusive of and responsive to neighborhoods across our city. We fought for greater educational possibilities for all Columbus kids, whether through Early Start Columbus or Columbus Promise. We championed safe routes to schools, paid family leave, an equitable tree canopy, and the rights of all youth to toxin-free playing fields.\r\n\r\nWhen former President Trump’s deportation policies threatened undocumented Columbus families, we secured free legal education and representation. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit low-income, Black, and brown families hardest, we funded direct emergency financial assistance. We fought for free speech rights, demilitarized Columbus police, and invested in youth and community to make us all safer.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the obstacles to financial stability that debt, low credit scores, and low wages present, we established a living wage for city job creation projects, funded free one-on-one financial counseling as a public service, and even charted the course for canceling medical debt for 80,000 people we work for.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, unwaveringly, we have stood for reproductive justice: by cracking down on harassment outside reproductive health clinics, by providing free menstrual products in city bathrooms, by updating our nondiscrimination ordinance to include the protection of all reproductive health choices, and by seeding a $1 million fund for abortion access.\r\n\r\nOur work together will continue to inspire me to advocate for a more equitable city for all Columbus residents into the future. Thank you for your collaboration, sincerity, and friendship for these seven years. I am proud to have served with you and all my colleagues on Council.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nElizabeth Brown\r\nCouncil President Pro Tempore\r\n\r\nCC: Andrea Blevins, CMC, City Clerk\r\nCC: All Council Members\r\n\r\nResignation Letter of Former President Pro Tem Elizabeth Brown was read into the record prior to the appointment of a new Member of Council to fill the vacancy.\r\n\r\nPresident Hardin and other Members of Council thanked the candidates that applied to fill the vacancy.\r\n\r\nPresident Hardin opened the floor for nominations to fill the vacancy as a Member of Columbus City Council.\r\n\r\nCouncilmember Emmanuel V. Remy moved that Mitchell J. Brown be appointed to fill the vacancy.  \r\n\r\nPresident Hardin asked if there were any other nominations.  President Hardin asked for a vote by voice on the nomination of Mitchell J. Brown.  The motion carried by the following vote: AFFIRMATIVE: 6 NEGATIVE: 0\r\n\r\nPresident Hardin stated that Councilmember Brown will be sworn in at a later date.  President Hardin noted for the record that a new President Pro Tem will be elected and committee assignments read into the record at the next regular meeting on January 30th at 5:00pm.",
