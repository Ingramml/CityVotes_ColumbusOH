This document is simply a current version of initial guidelines issued in September 2010.\r\nPlease note that updates have been made to this document in the Credit Ratings section due to changes to credit rating methodology and scorecard framework. In addition, minor updates have been made to the language.\r\nI ask that you read this letter, and by reference to the Guidelines, include both into the official communications received by the Council.\r\nI am available for questions you or the Council may have.\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nMegan N.
