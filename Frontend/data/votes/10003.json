    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from 5CL Properties LLC, an Ohio limited liability company, asking that the City transfer them a 1,263 square foot (0.029 acre) portion of the right-of-way in an alley located North of Second Avenue and West of Cleveland Avenue. Right-of-way area runs east/west directionally for 90+/- feet and the width of the requested portion is 15+/- feet from north to south.  This right-of-way is adjacent to the parcel at 440 - 470 E STARR AV (PID 010-001529) at the south-eastern side of the parcel; and 454 SECOND AV (PID 010-032852); 456-8 E 2ND AVE (PID 010-011936); and 462 E SECOND AVE (PID 010-054731), all three parcels are at the south of the requested portion of right-of-way.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will allow the applicant to accomplish an expansion of the existing facility/operations at 5th and Cleveland Avenue. The purpose of the transfer is to incorporate it with the adjacent parcel for a new build duplex on the lot.  The additional property would be used to increase the building mass of the project, as well as provide more space for parking at the rear of the property. The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $3,789.00 was established.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on March 21, 2024.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to 5CL Properties LLC, an Ohio limited liability company at the cost of $3,789.00 to them.\n                     \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The City will receive a total of $3,789.00 and the funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of 1,263 square foot (0.029 acre) portion of right-of-way North of Second Avenue and West of Cleveland Avenue to 5CL Properties LLC.
