    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing indefinite quantity contract with API Security Services for security services at City of Columbus pools, sports facilities and other locations as needed. The initial contract is not to exceed $50,000.00.  A modification amount was authorized by ordinance 1304-2024 to increase the amount by $50,000.00 for an aggregate maximum obligation of $100,000.00.  This ordinance will be the second modification to the contract and will increase it by $125,000.00 for an aggregate maximum obligation under the contract of $225,000.00.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department utilizes the Columbus Police Department for all security needs when possible.  If there are needs that exceed the ability of CPD to assist then private security companies are scheduled to fulfill those needs.  API is currently the primary back up security service for all pool, athletic complexes and other facilities operated by the Recreation and Parks Department.  There has been an unexpected increased need for security at all outdoor pools due to heightened security concerns and extreme heat conditions which have resulted in longer operating hours.  We have had difficulty in filling all required openings with CPD officers and therefore additional private security officers are needed.  An additional $125,000.00 will ensure that all facilities are secured.\n \nSecurity services for 2024 were bid out on RFQ026642.  Four vendors responded, API Security Services, Community Crime Patrol, National Patrol Services LLC, and Zachariah Carper. Contracts have been authorized with all vendors.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nAPI Security Services \n867 High Street Ste D\nWorthington, OH 43085 \nContract Compliance Number: 007115\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure that Recreation and Parks facilities continue to operate safely during the summer season and for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety.\n \nFiscal Impact: $125,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.  The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification shall be $225,000.00.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with API Security Services for security services at City of Columbus pools, sports facilities and other locations; to authorize the expenditure of $125,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($125,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with API Security Services for security services at City of Columbus pools, sports facilities and other locations; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $125,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Recreation and Parks in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify an existing contract for security services to ensure that Recreation and Parks facilities continue to operate safely during the summer season, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety; and NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
