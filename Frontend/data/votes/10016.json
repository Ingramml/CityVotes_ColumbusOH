    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) for Transportation Alternative Program construction funding which will be used to build a section of the Big Walnut Trail, from Cherrybottom Park to Morse Road.\n \nThe project will build 1.5 miles of significant trail infrastructure for the Big Walnut Regional Trail, including an extension starting from Cherrybottom Park to Morse Road where the trail will connect to the Gahanna trail network. Over 3,000 Columbus residents live in neighborhoods served by this new trail section. Once completed, the trail will connect residents to retail, services, and over 40,000 jobs at major destinations including Easton and the Morse Road Corridor.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an application for grant funds only and is not a commitment to expend City funds. MORPC requires that the City agrees to obligate the funds at a later date which will satisfactorily complete the proposed project and become eligible for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the grant. If the grant is awarded, future legislation will follow to authorize acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of City funds\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC)                  \n111 Liberty Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                        \nWilliam Murdock, Executive Director, (614) 228-2663                                                    \nContract Compliance Number: 004591\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 25, 2024 (Renewal Pending)\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to meet the grant application deadline of August 30, 2024.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year-round benefits to urban lifestyles.
