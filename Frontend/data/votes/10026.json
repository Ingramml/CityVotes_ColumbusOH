This agreement provides continued financial support for staff, including a Spanish-speaking business advisor. These staff will continue their support of Columbus small businesses as they continue their recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic. This modification will allow for the extension of the expiration of the beneficiary grant agreement to October 31, 2025.\n \nOrdinance 1201-2021 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate approximately $187,030,138.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds as signed into law by the President of the United States on March 11, 2021.\n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will be modified while this beneficiary grant agreement is in effect and it is requested that the Director of Development be given the authority to modify the terms and conditions of the beneficiary grant agreement without seeking additional Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.\n \nThe Ohio Small Business Development Center at Columbus State Community College is a public/private partnership supported in part by the U.S. Small Business Administration, Ohio Department of Development, Columbus State Community College, the City of Columbus and other local partners. SBDC serves an eight-county region including Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Licking, Logan, Madison, Pickaway, and Union counties.\n \nSBDC is part of America’s Small Business Development Centers, a national network comprised of over 1000 Centers across the U.S. including 29 in Ohio.  The Ohio SBDC Network provides one-on-one advising, by Certified Business Advisors, at no cost and conduct no or low-cost business training. SBDC focuses on all industries and business needs from seed to maturity and everything stage in-between.\n \nEmergency action is requested to accommodate the forthcoming August recess and to ensure that the agreement does not lapse, leading to the loss of encumbered ARPA funds.   \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004263 and expires 05/30/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the beneficiary grant agreement initially authorized under Ordinance No. 1699-2023 to allow for the extension of the expiration of the beneficiary grant agreement; and to declare an emergency.
