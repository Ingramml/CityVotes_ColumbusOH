    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with Dress for Success Columbus for the third and final year of the department’s Elevate! 1.0 program, in an amount up to $100,000.00.  The term of this Grant Agreement shall be either a 12-month or an 18-month period beginning July 1, 2024. Additional Elevate! 1.0 dollars are being allocated to other agencies in separate pieces of legislation.\n \nColumbus, renowned as America's Opportunity City, remains a beacon of potential and hope for its residents. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the population faces challenges stemming from personal, societal, structural, and economic factors, which impede their full participation in the city's myriad opportunities. Acknowledging the complexity of these challenges, the City is committed to implementing a comprehensive solution and is responsible for driving transformative changes to establish equitable opportunities for all residents.\n \nThe Elevate! Initiative plays a pivotal role in effecting this transformative change. Funding for this legislation is strictly for Dress for Success Columbus as the other agencies were funded in a separate piece of legislation, denoted as 1.0 and 2.0, collectively addressing 16 of the 21 aspirations outlined in The Mayor’s Opportunity Rising. Through various means, the Elevate! Initiative promotes and provides opportunities for collaboration, learning, and resource sharing among member agencies, ensuring that every community member they serve can access the services needed based upon their unique circumstance.\n \nThe Elevate! 1.0 NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability) was advertised from April 22, 2022, through May 13, 2022, on the City’s Website (Department of Development webpage), the Human Service Chamber of Franklin County’s website, and by press release. The City received 86 proposals for $9,875,000.00 in requests. Forty-eight community agencies were recommended for the $5,000,000.00 in available funding. This ordinance is specifically for Dress for Success Columbus.\n \nThe City of Columbus continues to see increases in the number of residents who lack access to affordable housing. Advocates report that anywhere between 300-600 people are living unsheltered in Columbus every day; the majority desire safe and affordable housing.  Additionally, infant mortality rates in Columbus and Franklin County remain alarmingly high for black babies. Immigrants and refugees relocate to Columbus because we are a welcoming city.  Columbus’ limited supply of housing, lack of knowledge about services and programs that support renting and homeownership, and lack of access to those services cause housing instability among immigrant and refugee residents. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate all these conditions for Columbus residents.  Every organization that was recommended for funding provides services in at least one of the following Elevate! NOFA focus areas:  Increasing Infant Vitality, Reducing Unsheltered Homelessness, or Increasing Housing Stability among Immigrant and Refugee households. \n \nFunding will be advanced to Dress for Success Columbus on a predetermined schedule. Advancement of funds is needed because many of the organizations do not have funding available to be reimbursed for program expenses. The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order. Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the grant agreement. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the Department of Development’s 2023 General Fund budget.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 001406 and expires 11/7/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Dress For Success Columbus in an amount of up to $100,000.00 for the Elevate! 1.0 Program; to authorize the provision of services for a 12 or 18 month period beginning July 1, 2024; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the General Fund.
