    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Division of Police and the Recreation and Parks Department, to associate the General Budget Reservation resulting from this ordinance with the Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement for Mobile Security Trailers with LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems as required for approval by City Council for an expenditure of more than $100,000.00.  The City of Columbus entered into an agreement in 2022 to rent portable lights and camera systems for placement in City parks that are of concern to the community and the Division of Police. These light and camera systems enhance the Division of Police’s ability to actively monitor the parks. These cameras may assist in the apprehension of suspects. Locations for initial deployment were identified by the Division of Police and the Recreation and Parks Department utilizing the latest crime data, as well as intelligence from patrol officers and neighborhood residents. These systems are mobile, allowing the Division to relocate them to the areas of greatest need.  The Department of Public Safety has determined that it will be more cost-effective to purchase mobile security trailers rather than to continue to rent them.  An existing Universal Term Contract was established by the Purchasing Office for such purpose with LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems as a result of RFQ026042. This ordinance will fund the purchase of twenty mobile security trailers with LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems via the terms and conditions of the Universal Term Contract (PA007034).\n \nBid Information: A Universal Term Contract with LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems exists for this expenditure. The contract compliance number for LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems is CC-047271 (expires 11/14/25).\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $968,418.00 from an existing purchasing agreement with LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems for mobile security trailers and a transfer within Public Safety's 2023 Capital Improvement Budget. \n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer of funds within the Safety G.O. Bonds Fund, Fund 7701; to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to establish purchase orders from an existing Purchase Agreement with LRG Technologies, LLC dba Mobile Pro Systems for the purchase of mobile security trailers for the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police; to authorize the expenditure of $768,418.00 from the Safety G.O.
