    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a comprehensive records management system (RMS).  This ordinance also authorizes the Director of Public\nSafety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract with Intergraph Corporation for services needed to allow the RMS to automatically interface with our computer aided dispatch (CAD) system.  In 2023, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire,\npublished a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a comprehensive records management system (RMS). In the past, the Division of Fire has maintained separate contracts for records management services. The goal of this RFP was to contract with a company that can\nprovide a comprehensive record management system that meets all of the City’s technology requirements and provides all of the necessary incident report platforms. After evaluation, in compliance with the Revised Code of the State of Ohio, the Charter of the City of\nColumbus, Columbus City Code Section 329.28 and Title 39, the selection committee recommends entering into contract with ImageTrend, LLC for the records management system. \n \nThis contract is necessary to provide EMS and Fire Incident reporting, in addition to fire inspection reporting software. Each year, the Columbus Division of Fire (CFD) responds to over 170,000 calls for service. Each EMS incident requires an incident report to be completed in a NEMSIS 3.4 compliant format that meets national standards. That information creates a permanent patient record that is maintained by the Division of Fire. This report is used as justification for EMS transport billing, which generates approximately  $20 million annually in revenue for the City's general fund. The incident reports are also used to share information with local hospitals and are referenced for continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts to ensure CFD maintains a high level of EMS/pre-hospital care. The information is also maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. Also, each fire incident is required to have an incident report completed in NFIRS 5.0 format that meets national standards. That information is maintained as a public record and is submitted to the Ohio Fire Marshal’s office and the US Fire Administration to provide data for the national fire incident database. The information is also maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. Additionally, each commercial occupancy and multi-family occupancy unit is inspected on an annual basis. The CFD Fire Prevention Bureau inspects over 35,000 buildings to ensure they maintain compliance with the Ohio Fire Code and the Local City Fire code. The Fire Prevention Bureau also issues permits for various fire code requirements. The information is also maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. ImageTrend, LLC's product performs all of the above functions, along with providing various record keeping modules. These record keeping tools will aid in the efficiency of maintaining inventory of various tools, supplies and other items that the Division of Fire must create records to maintain. \n \nImageTrend, LLC needs to provide an outside connection to the computer aided dispatch (CAD) system to allow for basic incident information to automatically interface with ImageTrend, LLC. Our current CAD vendor is Intergraph Corporation, which provides the Hexagon product.  Intergraph Corporation is the only known company that can provide maintenance, support, and licensing for the Hexagon product.  Therefore, this contract will be executed in accordance with the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code. \n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes the initial payment of $225,000.00 to ImageTrend, LLC for the comprehensive records management system.  Future payments will be authorized in subsequent ordinances.  This ordinance also authorizes payment of $14,990.45 to Intergraph Corporation for services to allow ImageTrend, LLC to interface with our CAD system.  Funds are available within the Department of Public Safety's 2024 General Fund Budget for these contracts.  A transfer is required between object classes and divisions to fund the initial payment of $225,000.00.\n \nEmergency Designation:  This ordinance is being processed as an emergency measure in order to meet the project timeline of issuing a Purchase Order by August 1, 2024.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a comprehensive records management system; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into contract with Intergraph Corporation for services needed to allow the records management system to interface with our computer aided dispatch system in accordance with the sole source procurement provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the transfer of $225,000.00 between divisions and object classes within the general fund; to authorize the expenditure of $239,990.45 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
