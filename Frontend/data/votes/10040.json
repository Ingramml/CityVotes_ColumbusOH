    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify, increase and extend the contract with Ohio State University, Office of Sponsored Programs for the purpose of providing professional engineering services for the Blueprint Columbus - Linden Green Infrastructure Monitoring Project, as authorized by Ordinance No. 3015-2018, passed by Columbus City Council on 12/3/18. Blueprint Columbus is the approach chosen by Columbus and approved by the Ohio EPA to bring the City into compliance with consent orders regarding sewer overflows. One of the benefits of this plan is that the included green infrastructure (GI) is better for the environment than traditional alternatives. While remaining within the City’s right-of-way, the GI will often be located in neighborhoods and adjacent to residential properties. It is important to understand the various impacts from the installation of GI in a dense, urban, residential environment. The data collected as part of this project will be analyzed to determine 1) to what extent property values increase or decrease as a result of the installation of GI and 2) the value of other ecosystem services that are generated by the GI projects, including habitat, water, quality, health and social benefits, and 3) how the valuation of these services varies with the different attributes of GI. \n \nAs a non-profit organization, the Ohio State University/Office of Sponsored Programs will enhance compliance with the City’s commitments to Ohio EPA by measuring the economic, social, and environmental impact of a large-scale GI project on the community in which it is installed. This information will be combined with similar efforts already under way in the Clintonville Blueprint Project Area to improve the design and planning of future projects.\n \n                     1. Amount of additional funds: The amount of additional funds for this contract is $95,000 for year 2024 and is budgeted in the 2024 Stormwater Operating Budget.  \n                     \n                     2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen: These funds were foreseen in the original contract.\n \n                     3. Reason other procurement processes were not used: OSU is the sole provider with the expertise to fulfill this contract.\n \n                     4. How cost was determined:  The cost, terms and conditions are in accordance with negotiated modifications to the agreement.\n \nSUPPLIER: Ohio State University/Office of Sponsored Programs Dax Vendor #006163, Expires 3/29/2025 (Non-Profit Organization)\n    \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify, increase and extend the contract for professional services with Ohio State University, Office of Sponsored Projects for the Blueprint Columbus - Linden Green Infrastructure Monitoring Project for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Stormwater and Regulatory Management Section; and to authorize the expenditure of $95,000.00 from the Stormwater Operating Fund.
