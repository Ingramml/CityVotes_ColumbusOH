    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND  \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services contract awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process with Patrick Engineering, Inc., for the Relay Upgrade Drawing Preparation Project, CIP #670883-100001, in an amount up to $580,227.00 for the Division of Power.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Division of Power (DOP), owns and operates a public electric distribution system. DOP intends to replace 14.4kV power distribution electromechanical and solid-state relays reaching their end of life with modern microprocessor based protective relaying. These relay replacements will allow for better coordination with downstream devices and allow for fault analysis.\n \nThis project will prepare installation drawings for the replacement of 14.4kV feeder protection relaying and control switches at three substations, for a total of 30 relay cubicles being upgraded.  \n \n1.                     Jackson Pike Substation, located at 2500 Jackson Pike Columbus, OH 43223; consists of 14.4kV distribution in a main tie main tie main arrangement. There are a total of 9 cubicles; 2 mains, 1 tie, and 6 feeders receiving new relays in this substation.\n \n2.                     Furnace Substation, located at 400 Furnace St., Columbus, OH 43215; consists of 14.4kV distribution in a main tie main arrangement. There are a total of 10 cubicles; 2 mains, 1 tie, and 7 feeders receiving new relays in this substation.\n \n3.                     West Substation, located at 56 N. Wheatland Ave. consists of 14.4kV distribution in a main tie main arrangement. There are a total of 11 cubicles; 2 mains, 1 tie, and 8 feeders receiving new relays in this substation.\n \nThe Community Planning Areas is 99 - Citywide as these electric substations directly serve multiple planning areas in the city.\n \nTIMELINE & FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  \nThe schedule for this project is expected to take 12 months. \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nThe negotiated professional services agreement amount is $580,227.00, including a 15% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n                     \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                          $           580,227.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                     $                     0.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                          $           580,227.00\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe relay improvements at the Furnace, Jackson Pike, and West electric substations will provide a more resilient and reliable power distribution system.  This will result in few power interruptions to the customers served by these substations which will minimize any economic impacts due to power outages.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION \nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 3/1/24.   One proposal was received:\n \nName                                            C.C.
