    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will award and administer water infrastructure projects identified as Congressionally Directed Spending (CDS) and Community Project Funding (CPF) (also known as “earmarks”) from federal appropriations acts. For Fiscal Year 2024 and 2025 (FY 24 and FY25) the Consolidated Appropriations Act includes funding for State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) accounts funded by the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund, and the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund, which provides the opportunity for water, wastewater and storm water infrastructure grant funding. These requests are received through Members of Congress.  Starting with the fiscal year 2022 appropriations, Members of Congress began a new process for Members.
