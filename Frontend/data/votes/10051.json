    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, for the investigation of water resources in central Ohio, including groundwater and several rivers for the Division of Water and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage. The cooperative program of stream investigation and monitoring by the U.S. Geological Survey has been continued for several years.  It provides valuable water resource data to the City at a lower cost than providing such data by other means.
