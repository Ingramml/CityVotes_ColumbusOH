    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. for the DOSD HVAC & Air Purification System Replacements, No.2, contract, CIP #650265-100200, in an amount up to $483,728.65.\n \nThis contract addresses various Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) Facilities.  Many of the HVAC & Air Purification Units are approaching the end of their useful life and are becoming increasingly difficult to repair, to maintain, and to update controller software programs. The basis of design for this program is based on the HVAC & Air Purification Unit survey report prepared during the HVAC Program #1 for the Division's various buildings, including both Waste Water Treatment Plants, the Compost Facility, and the Sewer Maintenance and Operations Center (SMOC) that determine the age and condition of the current equipment.  This report will continue to be the guiding document to schedule and replace the failing units on a priority basis.  This contract work includes preliminary engineering, detailed design, and services during construction for the units selected for each year of construction.\n \nThis ordinance is a planned modification to an existing contract.  It adds funds to perform additional task order work.  Tasks planned for this modification include additional preliminary engineering, planning and prioritization of HVAC replacements, detailed design bid packages, and services during construction.\n \nPlanning Area - “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $483,728.65\nOriginal Contract                                                                             $563,000.00 (ORD 0143-2023; PO368965)\n                     Modification 1 (Current)                                              $483,728.65\n                     Modification 2 (Future)                                                     $577,000.00\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                                $1,623,728.65 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a planned modification to add funds to a contract that was awarded through the City’s Request for Approval process.  Another procurement process is not required to do this. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA funding needs estimate was established based upon the expected contract tasks and an estimate of the cost of the tasks as determined by existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project is necessary for replacement of failing HVAC systems at our facilities.  Environmental benefits will likely be inherent in the project, because newly designed units will be likely be more energy efficient.  No community outreach or input is believed to be necessary. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.’s contract compliance number is CC005665 and expires 4/12/26.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was awarded with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  This 10% goal applies to all contract spending, including the original contract dollar amount and all modifications to change contract funding.  Failure by the consultant to meet this goal subjects the consultant to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.  The projected MBE/WBE percentage for this contract modification is 8.3%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd., a City certified MBE company, has proposed the following two subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nBrown and Caldwell                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nDynotec, Inc.                                                                       Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\n \nThe certification of Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
