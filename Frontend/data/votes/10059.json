and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the offices of the City Auditor and Department of Finance and Management in that the timely issuance of the Refunding Bonds will allow the FCCFA to take advantage of favorable market conditions in issuing the Refunding Bonds, which will result in savings that inure to the benefit of the City, its taxpayers and its citizens and therefore, the passage of this ordinance is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety;
