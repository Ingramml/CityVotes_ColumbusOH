    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with ARCADIS U.S., Inc. for the HCWP Hypochlorite Disinfection Improvements project, CIP #690486-100000, in an amount up to $2,999,688.00 for the Division of Water.\n \nThis contract provides for design of improvements to the disinfection storage and feed facilities at the Hap Cremean Water Plant.  The plant currently utilizes a chlorine gas based process and this project will convert the plant to a liquid sodium hypochlorite based process.  Retrofitting existing facilities for storage and feed of an alternate disinfectant will provide for safer storage and handling.  \nWork performed to date under this contract includes preliminary design services, detailed design and bidding services.  This modification provides for engineering services during construction.  This is the final planned contract modification. \n \nThe Hap Cremean Water Plant serves multiple community planning areas so this project is coded as “99”, city-wide.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $2,999,688.00\nPreliminary Design (Original Contract)                                                                    $587,000.00 (ORD 2817-2016; PO053678)\nDetailed Design (Renewal 1)                                                                           $ 2,159,645.00 (ORD 1754-2019; PO190205) \nServices During Construction (Modification 2)                                                       $ 1,950,000.00 (ORD 2987-2021; PO308061) \nFinal Services During Construction (Modification 3- current)                        $ 2,999,688.00 \nESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                               $ 7,696,333.00 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was bid through the City’s RFP process with the intention of doing planned modifications to add funding for each stage of the design process.  This is one of those planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work and existing contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed the proposal and negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe potential threat of an accidental or intentional release of chlorine gas will be eliminated with this project \n \nThis work will occur within the secure area of the HCWP that is not accessible to the public, so public meetings are not anticipated.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nARCADIS U.S., Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC009409 and expires 2/22/25.\n \n4.
