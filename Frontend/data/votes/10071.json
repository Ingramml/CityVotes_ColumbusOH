    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND  \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services contract awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process with CDM Smith, for the Water Reuse Study Project, CIP #691800-100001, in an amount up to $1,959,242.00 for the Division of Water.\n \nThe population of the Central Ohio area is expected to grow by more than 700,000 people within the next 25 years, which will increase demand on the City of Columbus’s potable water supply system.  To help the City meet these increased potable water demands, the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) is evaluating the non-potable water reuse to supply water to existing and future industrial/commercial users, which in turn will reduce the demand on the potable water supply system. Examples of industrial/commercial users include data centers, industrial cooling, irrigation, and manufacturing.  The design professional shall perform studies and produce technical memoranda related to Non-Potable Reuse that provides the explanation necessary to understand the existing conditions, establish design criteria, identify and evaluate possible alternatives, and recommend a conceptual implementation approach.\nThe Community Planning Area is “99-Citywide”\n \nTIMELINE & FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  \nThe Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2024.  The Draft Study Report is due 12 months after the Notice to Proceed and the Final Study Report is anticipated 4 months after the Draft Report is accepted.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nThe amount of the initial contract and anticipated future contract modifications is listed below\n \nCost summary: \n                     Initial Contract (current)                                                                                    $ 1,959,242.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                         $ 1,959,242.00\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe use of non-potable water to supply water to existing and future industrial/commercial users will reduce the demand on the potable water supply system. \n \nSustainable design options will be evaluated for integration into the project.
