Reason other procurement processes are not used:  This contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process for engineering services needed to complete the project with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned modifications to add funding.  Another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4. How the cost of renewal was determined:  The cost proposal was provided by Stantec Consulting Services Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage, and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.  The fees in the proposal are based upon contract pricing already established for job titles, tasks, and allowable expenses for the contract.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will extend the reach of the Big Walnut Trunk to its full build out capacity and will allow the City of Columbus to extend its service area thus creating additional utility and tax base.  It will also allow for future developments and extensions of sanitary sewers into new or existing neighborhoods that would have previously had to utilize a home sewage treatment system.  This will increase runoff and ground water quality for the region. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nStantec Consulting Services Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-000462 and expires 7/6/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.
