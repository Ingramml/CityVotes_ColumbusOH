    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Harmony Project in support of the Students Arts, Community Arts, Volunteer Program, and Community Chorus programs.\n \nHarmony Project was formed in 2009 with the mission of building a stronger and more inclusive community through the arts and volunteer services. The Harmony Project has programs serving differently-abled adults; men and women who have experienced homelessness; students from across the economic spectrum, yet predominantly from low-income households; women and men serving time; veterans, and restored citizens. \n \nHarmony Project's unique approach of combining arts with community service and social impact creates a powerful synergy that not only entertains but transforms lives. This holistic approach addresses complex social issues and fosters a more inclusive and compassionate society. Investing in Harmony Project means investing in the future of our community. The Student Arts program uniquely teaches job preparedness skills through the arts, equipping young people with essential communication, collaboration, and integration skills for their future careers. The Community Arts program helps differently-abled individuals feel valued, reducing anxiety and depression and increasing overall wellness. Research indicates that participating in music programs can increase feelings of inclusion and belonging by 70%, fostering a more connected and supportive community. Harmony's Volunteer Program and Public Community Chorus Concerts contributes over 60,000 volunteer hours and $1.5 million of in-kind value each year to the City of Columbus.\n \nFiscal impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Harmony Project in support of the Students Arts, Community Arts, Volunteer Program, and Community Chorus programs; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
