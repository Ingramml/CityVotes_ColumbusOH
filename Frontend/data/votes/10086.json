    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Office of CelebrateOne has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Medicaid which is administered by the State’s Managed Care Plans. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $1,130,000.00 in grant monies to fund the Enhanced Maternal Health Program for the period July 1, 2024 through December 31st, 2024. \n \nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid awarded the 2022-2024 grant to the Office of CelebrateOne at the City of Columbus to coordinate the Enhanced Maternal Health Program in Franklin County. CelebrateOne has been designated as the primary grantee organization and administrator for this grant for Franklin County.  The Ohio Department of Medicaid extended the grant period from July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n \nWith the extension funding, the Office of CelebrateOne will establish contracts with up to fourteen  (14) community partners in order to provide health and education services to expecting moms and moms of children under one (1) year of age.  Many of the partners were contracted during the original grant period of July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024 and they have remaining work to complete through the end of 2024.  In addition, three new community partners were added to this grant extension, mOBINurses, Inc., Lower Lights Christian Health Center, and Legal Aid Partners of Southeast and Central Ohio.\n \nGrant funding will provide continued investment in Centering Pregnancy options in priority geographies through Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers and PrimaryOne Health, while also strengthening prenatal home visiting teams at Center for Healthy Families. Additional health care support for pre- and post-natal parents will be provided by Lower Lights Christian Health Center. \n \nIn addition, this grant provides support for culturally informed doula care with mOBINurses, Inc., maintains trauma-informed prenatal support through Moms2B, and provides support to the information and referral line, StepOne for a Healthy Pregnancy. This grant addresses gaps in service by increasing support for teen outreach through The Center for Healthy Families, provides new support for medical-legal issues through Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio.\n \nFinally, this grant ensures that the community’s strong core of community health workers at CelebrateOne, the YMCA of Central Ohio continue to connect women and families to services and resources that support a healthy pregnancy.  In addition, the grant will fund some CelebrateOne Community Health Worker salaries as they also provide services to both pre- and post-natal parents.\n \nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid Grant Extension, in the amount of $1,130,000.00, is expected to be received in July 2024 and is planned to conclude by December 31, 2024.  Expenditures are planned within CelebrateOne and fourteen (14) partnering agencies.  \n \n\n\n\nCelebrateOne - Connector Corps\n\n$119,164.00 \n\n\n\nYMCA of Central Ohio\n\n$100,000.00\n\n\n\nLegal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio \n\n$50,000.00\n\n\n\nCity of Refuge Good Life Foundation\n\n$60,000.00\n\n\n\nMoms2B/The Ohio State University\n\n$100,000.00\n\n\n\nPhysicians Care Connection\n\n$75,000.00\n\n\n\nProject Milk Mission\n\n$57,084.00\n\n\n\nMental Health America of Ohio\n\n$50,752.00\n\n\n\nUrban Family Development Center/Dads2B\n\n$55,000.00\n\n\n\nPrimaryOne Health\n\n$100,000.00\n\n\n\nThe Center for Healthy Families\n\n$65,000.00 \n\n\n\nOhioHealth\n\n$100,000.00 \n\n\n\nHeart of Ohio Family Health Centers\n\n$60,000.00\n\n\n\nmOBI Nurses\n\n$80,000.00\n\n\n\nLower Lights Christian Health Center \n\n$58,000.00\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n$1,130,000.00\n\n\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is NOT requested at this time.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $1,130,000.00 in Ohio Department of Medicaid grant monies to fund the Enhanced Maternal Health Program extension.
