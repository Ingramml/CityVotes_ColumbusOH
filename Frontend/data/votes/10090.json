    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThe Ohio EPA Division of Drinking and Ground Water will award and administer water infrastructure grant projects made possible under Governor Mike DeWine’s H2Ohio Initiative. Grants are provided to reimburse the initial cost of valve exercising, leak detection and meter accuracy testing equipment. Items cannot be purchased until an agreement has been signed by the City of Columbus Public Water System and Ohio EPA. H2Ohio is a comprehensive and data-driven approach to reduce harmful algal blooms, improve wastewater, and water infrastructure, and prevent lead contamination. \nThe Department of Public Utilities requests approval to apply for and if funded, receive a grant for $6,824.00 for a Public Water System Distribution Equipment Grant project. The City requests funding for underground radio detection utility locator equipment to be used by the utility line locating staff to locate marker balls placed on our underground sludge line facilities. The line locators currently utilize similar equipment for everyday operations, which helps keep all Department of Public Utilities-owned facilities safe by accurately marking them for excavators. This equipment will help City staff locate the underground sludge lines more accurately. \n FISCAL IMPACT\nApproval of this legislation will authorize the Director of Public Utilities to apply for, receive, and if funded, appropriate and expend grant funds from Ohio EPA and the H2Ohio Initiative.
