($45,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with the National Center for Water Quality Research (NCWQR) at Heidelberg University to provide funding for the continued operation of the water quality tributary loading monitoring station on the Scioto River at Chillicothe. This operation will be conducted in collaboration with the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) and includes intensive sampling, analysis of suspended sediments, and the calculation of the separate contributions of point-source and nonpoint-source loads of phosphorus and other pollutants in the Scioto River watershed upstream of the station. The first phase of this work was completed during calendar years 2014 through 2016, with a second phase running from calendar years 2017 through 2021. This third phase will occur during calendar years 2022 through 2026.\n \nThe NCWQR, founded in 1969 by Dr. David B. Baker, is a research organization within the science departments of Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio. The Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program (HTLP) began in 1974 and added the Scioto River monitoring station at Chillicothe in 1996. Presently there are 22 stations in the HTLP in Ohio and southeastern Michigan, which permit the calculation of pollutant loads from over 50% of Ohio’s land area. The NCWQR uses information from these stations to calculate the loads of nutrients, sediments, and pesticides delivered to Lake Erie and the Ohio River. The HTLP receives funding from a combination of state and federal agencies, foundations, industries, individuals through research grants, and contract or well test analyses. All of the resulting data, including those for the Scioto River Loading Station, are publicly available at the HTLP website.\n \nMeasurements of pollutant export from watersheds are used to compare the amount of pollutants derived from diffuse nonpoint sources, such as agricultural and urban storm runoff, with contributions from point sources, such as publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities. The City of Columbus wastewater treatment plants are the two largest point-source dischargers into the Scioto River watershed. Accordingly, collecting pollutant monitoring data in the Scioto River watershed to compare Columbus discharges with those from other pollutant sources is of significant interest to the City.  \n \nIn operating the Chillicothe monitoring station, NCWQR will obtain the best available data on point-source loads to the Scioto River upstream of the monitoring station, compute the proportional contributions of point-source and nonpoint-source loads of total phosphorus and other pollutants of interest to DOSD. NCWQR will upload the data to the HTLP portal and coordinate with DOSD personnel to analyze dissolved organic carbon in a subset of samples collected at the Chillicothe station during both base flow and storm runoff events.\n \nThe work for this third phase of the agreement will occur during calendar years 2022 through 2026 and will continue as an annual ongoing contract. The cost estimate for calendar year 2024 operations is a not-to-exceed amount of $45,000.00. Funding requested for future years will be based upon budgeted funds and approval by City Council.\n    \nSUPPLIER:                      \n \nHeidelberg University | D365 Vendor #006982 | Expires 3/23/2025 \n \nHeidelberg University is a private institution and does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe university is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$45,000.00 is budgeted in the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund for this purchase.\n \n$42,000.00 was spent so far in 2024 as of July 16, 2024\n \n$32,000.00 was spent in 2023  \n$37,500.00 was spent in 2022\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Heidelberg University to provide funding and continued support to the National Center for Water Quality Research for the operation of a tributary loading station on the Scioto River and computation of point-source and nonpoint-source loads for 2024; and to authorize the expenditure of $45,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund.  ($45,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities wishes to enter into an agreement with Heidelberg University to provide funding and continued support to the National Center for Water Quality Research (NCWQR) in 2024 for the operation of a tributary loading station on the Scioto River at Chillicothe and computation of the separate contributions of point-source and nonpoint-source loads of phosphorus in the Scioto River watershed upstream of this station; and\n \nWHEREAS, the National Center for Water Quality Research (NCWQR) is a research organization within the science departments of Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio and receives funding from a combination of state and federal agencies, foundations, industries, individuals through research grants, and contract or well test analyses; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program (HTLP) began in 1974 and expanded to include the Scioto River monitoring station at Chillicothe in 1996; and \n \nWHEREAS, all of the resulting HTLP data are publicly available on the HTLP portal; and \n \nWHEREAS, there are 22 stations in the HTLP in Ohio and southeastern Michigan, which permit the calculation of pollutant loads from over 50% of Ohio’s land area; and \n \nWHEREAS, measurements of pollutant export are used to compare the amounts of pollutants derived from diffuse nonpoint sources, such as agricultural and urban storm runoff, with contributions from point sources, such as publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus wastewater treatment plants (Southerly and Jackson Pike) are the two largest point-source dischargers into the Scioto River watershed, and accordingly, collecting pollutant monitoring data in the Scioto River watershed to enable comparisons of Columbus discharges with other pollutant sources is of significant interest to the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the NCWQR will coordinate with DOSD personnel to analyze dissolved organic carbon in a subset of samples collected at the Chillicothe station during both base flow and storm runoff events; and\n \nWHEREAS, this is a continuation of a prior agreement, with phase one running from 2014 through 2016 and phase two running from 2017 through 2021.
