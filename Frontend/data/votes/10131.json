    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the encumbrance and expenditure of $200,000.00 for the purpose of reimbursing OhioHealth Corporation (“OhioHealth”) for design costs incurred relative to various public infrastructure improvements completed in the vicinity of S.R. 315 and North Broadway (the “Projects”).\nOrdinance 2894-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into reimbursement agreements with OhioHealth, whereby the City agreed to reimburse OhioHealth up to $3,877,000.00 for costs associated with the design and construction of the Projects. Ordinance 1454-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify a design reimbursement agreement with OhioHealth to facilitate additional work related to Stream Corridor Protection Zone (SCPZ) requirements and replacing an existing 20-inch water main along Olentangy River Road between Slyh Run and McConnell Drive. \n \nThe initial estimate to complete the additional work was $413,970.00. However, the actual costs incurred by OhioHealth relative to the completion of the necessary stream mitigation plans exceeded the funds previously appropriated for that purpose, necessitating the execution of a second modification between the parties, which was authorized pursuant to Ordinance 2923-2019. \n \nDue to an administrative error, ACPO003225, the Auditor’s Certificate established under Ordinance 1454-2018, was cancelled before the outstanding obligation to OhioHealth was satisfied. The legislation seeks to restore a portion of that funding to enable the City to do so. \n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for OhioHealth Corporation is CC006104, which expires February 22, 2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this project is available as follows: $164,072.15 is available in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund (7704); $6,131.06 is available in the Development Taxable Bonds Fund (7739); and $29,796.79 is available in the Northland and Other Acquisitions Fund (7735). A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within each of the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Development Taxable Bonds Fund, and the Northland and Other Acquisitions Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to enable the City to immediately replace the Auditor’s Certificate erroneously canceled in order for the City to satisfy its outstanding obligation to OhioHealth as soon as reasonably practicable. \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within each of the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Development Taxable Bonds Fund, and Northland and Other Acquisitions Fund; to authorize the Department of Public Service to reimburse OhioHealth Corporation for certain design costs incurred relative to various public infrastructure improvements completed in the vicinity of S.R. 315 and North Broadway; to authorize the expenditure of up to $164,072.15 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, the expenditure of up to $6,131.06 from the Development Taxable Bonds Funds, and the expenditure of up to $29,796.79 from the Northland and Other Acquisitions Fund;
