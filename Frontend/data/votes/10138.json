    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes an increase in the amount of the imprest petty cash fund within the Department of Recreation and Parks operating fund to accommodate the reimbursement of miscellaneous expenses incurred by Maintenance and Operations sections. The current authorized balance for the imprest petty cash fund is $500.00 for Maintenance and Operations at the Alum Industrial Complex.  This ordinance would allow for an additional $500.00 from the operating fund within the Department and Recreation and Parks, for an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 to bolster the imprest petty cash fund.
