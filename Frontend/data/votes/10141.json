    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Neighborhoods to modify a professional services contract with MKSK to add additional funds to support outreach and engagement with Eastland residents, community stakeholders, and City departments in the development of the comprehensive Eastland Community Plan in an amount up to $35,000.00.\nOrdinance No. 1712-2023 authorized the Director of Neighborhoods to enter into a professional services contract with MKSK for community planning services on June 26, 2023. This ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Neighborhoods to modify the original contract to add additional funding up to $35,000 for continued community planning services related to aforementioned outreach and engagement in the development of the comprehensive Eastland Community Plan.\nThe Department of Neighborhoods, solicited Requests for Proposals for the community planning services contract. The project was formally advertised on Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from March 3, 2023 to April 13, 2023. The City received thirteen (13) responses. The MKSK proposal received the highest score by the evaluation committee based upon the criteria.\nThis modification is necessary to cover the cost of the community planning services continued outreach and engagement.\nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $35,000.00\n\n\n\nThe original contract amount:\n\n$849,600.00\n\n(PO396050, Ord. 1712-2023)\n\n\n\nThe total of Modification 1:\n\n$0.00\n\n(Ord. 2540-2023)\n\n\n\nThe total of Modification 2:\n\n$0.00\n\n(Ord. 0659-2024)\n\n\n\nThe total of Modification 3:\n\n$35,000.00\n\n(Ord. 2166-2024)\n\n\n\nThe contract amount including all modifications:\n\n$884,600.00\n\n \n\n\n \nReasons additional services could not be foresee:\nThe robust outreach and engagement efforts have been essential to connecting Eastland residents and community stakeholders to the comprehensive Eastland community planning process. The number of initially proposed outreach and engagements exceeded the originally proposed amount in order to ensure we effectively engaged with Eastland residents, community stakeholders, and City departments. In addition, the attendance at past community events have exceeded initial projections. We anticipate upcoming community event attendance to be at the same levels.\nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nMKSK won the initial request for proposal and have been actively working with city departments and the Eastland community on community planning services that are not complete. It’s in the best interest of the Department to continue working with the selected vendor.\nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost modification was determined by internal review of the work proposed by the vendor. The fee is based on the appropriate estimate of hours and expenses determined to be required to complete the comprehensive Eastland community planning process.\nContract Compliance: The vendor number is 028341 and the contract compliance is 10/25/22-10/25/24.\nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $849,600.00 was legislated for community planning services by Ordinance 1712-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by up to $35,000.00. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $884,600.00.\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in the completion of the comprehensive Eastland community planning process and prevent MKSK from experiencing financial hardship.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Interim Director of Neighborhoods to modify and increase a community planning services contract with MKSK to develop a comprehensive community plan for the Eastland community; to authorize an expenditure up to $35,000.00 from the General Fund to pay for the contract modification; to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for outreach participants; and to declare an emergency.
