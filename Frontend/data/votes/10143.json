    "description": "BACKGROUND: \nThe American Rescue Plan was passed by Congress on March 10, 2021 and signed into law on March 11, 2021. The Plan established the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, and authorized the U.S. Treasury to make payments from that Fund to states and eligible units of local government, including the City of Columbus, to respond to the COVID 19 public health emergency and its negative economic impacts. The American Rescue Plan funds will be available for use through December 31, 2024. \nThe American Rescue Plan requires that the payments from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund be used to cover expenses that respond to the COVID 19 public health emergency, or its negative economic impacts, including but not limited to, providing assistance to households, small businesses, and nonprofits, or aid to impacted industries, such as tourism, travel, and hospitality; respond to workers performing essential work during the COVID 19 pandemic by providing premium pay to eligible workers of the City of Columbus performing essential work or by providing grants to eligible employers that have eligible workers; provide government services, to the extent COVID 19 caused a reduction of revenues collected in the most recent full fiscal year; or make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure. \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential.

In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\n \nFunding will support the work of non-profit agencies to extend MBK Round 3 grants for a period of 12 months to expand the collective work of addressing Milestone three to improve graduation and matriculation outcomes.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $286,000.00 from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds; Fund 2209; and authorizes the Interim Director of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with African American Male Wellness Agency, Always With Us Charities, Heart of JOB and Ice Mentors in an amount up to $286,000.00 to provide in-school and after-school academic based interventions.
