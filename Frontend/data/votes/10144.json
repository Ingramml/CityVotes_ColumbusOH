    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with St. Stephens Community Services, Inc. in support of Jazz in the Park.\n \nJazz-In-The-Park/Jazz-At-Maloney Park′s (JITP/JAMP) purpose and objectives is to engage Linden residents in a four-day summer concert series that provides Linden families with healthy alternative activities that are drug and violence free.\n \nEach Saturday during the month of July (July 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th) families will gather at the John Maloney Park, located at the corner of Joyce Avenue and 17th Avenue in South Linden to participate in a variety of family strengthening activities.\n \nOften residents may feel uncomfortable walking into a formal setting and having to admit they need help. JITP/JAMP reduces that anxiety and need to travel because “Resource Row” and the “Mini Job Fair” offers a ‘one stop hub of resources and potential employment’ in a relaxing environment.\n \nResidents will also have the chance to meet their elected officials (i.e. North and South Linden Area Commissioners, City Council Members and campaign candidates) and receive information about community development projects and express their concerns. JITP/JAMP offers an opportunity for residents to walk away feeling connected to their community and supported by the various resources readily available.\n \nEach Saturday the event has an attendance of 200+ residents (not including the organizers) with a total of over 1,500 residents served. Demographically, attendance is comprised of senior citizens, adults and children, with predominantly a minority-based group. An estimated weekly demographic breakdown of attendance identifies sixty (60) senior citizens, 100+ adults, and sixty-five (65) children. \n \nEmergency action is necessary for reimbursement for expenses that have already occurred.\n \nFiscal Impact: $12,800 will be appropriated and expended from available funds within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with St. Stephens Community Services, Inc. in support of Jazz in the Park; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($12,800.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Jazz in the Park engages Linden residents in a four-day summer concert series that provides Linden families with healthy alternative activities that are drug and violence free; and\n \nWHEREAS, each Saturday during the month of July (July 6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th) families will gather at the John Maloney Park, located at the corner of Joyce Avenue and 17th Avenue in South Linden to participate in a variety of family strengthening activities; and\n \nWHEREAS, residents will also have the chance to meet their elected officials and receive information about community development projects and express their concerns; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Clerk to provide reimbursement by entering into a grant agreement with St. Stephens Community Services, Inc. to serve as a fiscal agent in support of Jazz in the Park; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with St. Stephens Community Services, Inc. in support of Jazz in the Park.\n \nSECTION 2. That the appropriation and expenditure of $12,800.00, or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.
