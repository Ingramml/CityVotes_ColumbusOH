    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Jewish Family Services in support of an expansion of their CREW program.\n \nJewish Family Services (JFS) receives support for the CREW program from Franklin County. The City’s support will allow JFS to serve more people in need of job placement support that do not meet the TANF qualifications restricting the majority of the County’s dollars. CREW is a job placement program, with a highly successful placement rate of 96% in the most recent program year.\n \nThis grant to expand CREW will support personnel costs and allow JFS to serve an additional 50 individuals, including about a dozen childcare workers who were recently displaced due to a closure. JFS is an ideal partner for this work due to their extensive community partnerships and employer relationships that promote placement and retention success for job seekers.\n \nEmergency action is required due to the urgent needs of displaced workers from a specific local childcare center. Jewish Family Services cannot proceed with the expansion of the CREW program without timely City support.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this grant agreement is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Jewish Family Services in support of an expansion of their CREW program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.  ($95,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Jewish Family Services is a local nonprofit offering a number of services to Columbus residents including job training and placement services through their CREW program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to support pathways to prosperity for all Columbus residents, including displaced workers; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Jewish Family Services in support of an expansion of their CREW program and help provide for the needs of displaced workers from a local childcare center, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, amd safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
