(“WCCI”) is proposing the Juniper Crossing project. Juniper Crossing phase 1 is a proposed 44-unit senior 55+ affordable housing development located at 60 Obetz Road in the Far South neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio.\n \nJuniper Crossing will target households with incomes at 30% to 70% of area median gross income. Juniper Crossing will offer fifteen (15) one-bedroom units and twenty-nine (29) two-bedroom units. The target population for Juniper Crossing will be seniors aged 55+. Juniper Crossing will include the construction of a three-story elevator building with various amenities including: on-site management office, community room with kitchenette, and more.\n \nAs a condition to accepting this funding, Borrower agrees that five (5) units affordable at 30% AMI will be offered first to households currently in the shelter system with incomes that would be sufficient to pay the 30% AMI rents and meet all other criteria in the Tenant Selection Plan with the exception of an eviction due to non-payment of rent.  The project is within steps of COTA bus stops along South High Street and Obetz Road, multiple grocery stores providing access to fresh produce, several restaurants, adjacent to the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging, and a half a mile from Scioto Southland Community Center.\n \nThe entire project will be designed and constructed to achieve the City of Columbus’ AWARE standards as well as obtain Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) - silver or comparable energy efficiency certification. In addition, 10% of the dwelling units will be accessible for persons with mobility disabilities and an additional 2% of dwelling units will be accessible for persons with hearing or visual disabilities.\nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2023 Action Plan, per Ordinance 3353-2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the Director of Development to immediately execute a commitment letter and loan agreement with the developer in preparation for the project’s closing.  The City’s funding source is a critical component of the project funding.  A delay in execution of the city’s financial support documents may result in increased project costs and delayed closing.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 048849 and expires 04/18/2026.\n \nFiscal Impact: $400,000.00 is available from the 2023 HOME grant (G442202).  The commitment of funds through this legislation is conditioned on compliance with HUD’s environmental review requirements.
