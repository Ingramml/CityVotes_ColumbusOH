    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with The Waterworks, LLC to increase the contract in an amount up to $100,000.00 to provide residential emergency repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                         $300,000.00                     Ord. 0027-2024                      PO428622\nModification No. 1 amount                   $100,000.00                                Ord. 2103-2024                     \nTotal contract amount                                 $400,000.00 \n \nEmergency Heating, Plumbing, and Water and Sewer Repair is part of the Emergency Repair Program, operated by the Division of Housing.  The program was established to assist low and moderate-income homeowners with heating, plumbing, and water and sewer issues that constitute an emergency condition.  Emergency repairs under this legislation will address small and large-scale capital home improvements that, if not corrected, may require the owner to vacate their home.  Most homeowners are at or below 50% AMI as defined by HUD with exceptions allowed up to 80% AMI. \n \nThe department advertised RFQ026104 on Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide emergency mechanical repairs on October 10, 2023 with bids being due on November 3, 2023.  The department entered into contract with The Waterworks, LLC in an amount up to $300,000.00, approved by Council under ordinance 0027-2024.\n \nThe amount of additional funds expended under this modification will be $100,000.00.  This modification is needed in order to pay for emergency repairs on homes within the City of Columbus where the repair will allow the occupant to live safely in their home.  This will allow for payment of services that do not fit the eligibility of bond funds.  The contract terms will not change.\n \nEmergency action is requested to continue performing needed repairs for residents as quickly as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Division of Housing’s 2024 General Fund budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004777 and expires 3/9/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with The Waterworks, LLC to increase the contract in an amount up to $100,000.00 as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
