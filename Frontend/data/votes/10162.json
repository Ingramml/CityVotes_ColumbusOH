    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate two federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners Office of Justice Policy and Programs to the City Attorney’s Office. Grant awards support specialized prosecution and victim advocacy services for survivors of domestic violence. Award dollars fund 1) a portion of salary expenses for two specially trained domestic violence prosecutors, 2) total compensation for one specially trained anti-stalking victim advocate and 3) contract fees for interpretation and translation services.\n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Domestic Violence & Stalking Prosecution Unit provides best-practice prosecution services for victims of misdemeanor domestic violence and stalking crimes. The unit employs six highly-trained and experienced domestic violence prosecutors, sixteen victim advocates, one stalking investigator, one anti-stalking victim advocate and hosts professional liaisons from Capital University Law School’s Civil Protection Unit. Services provided by the unit are modeled after the National District Attorneys Association’s National Domestic Violence Prosecution Best Practice Guide and are designed to improve victim engagement; decrease recantation; and increase community and law enforcement collaboration. This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of grant funds and the transfer of the 25% city cash match ($57,655.21) from the transfer out account back to the city attorney general fund.\n \n\n\n\nAward #\n\nVAWA Award\n\n Cash Match\n\n\n\n23-WF-VA2-8758\n\n$109,791.01\n\n$36,596.99\n\n\n\n23-WF-VA2-4600\n\n$63,174.66\n\n$21,058.22\n\n\n\n2024 VAWA total\n\n$172,965.67\n\n$57,655.21\n\n\n \nEmergency Action: \nEmergency action is requested to ensure timely reimbursement for grant supported services provided through the first two quarters of 2024.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to accept federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards 23- WF-VA2-8758 and 23-WF-VA2-4600 from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners' Office of Justice Policy and Programs in the amount of $172,965.67 to support domestic violence and stalking prosecution and victim advocacy services; to authorize the transfer of $57,655.21 in city cash match from the transfer out account back to object classes 01 and 03 in the City Attorney general fund; and to authorize the appropriation of $172,965.67 in the general government grant fund; and to declare an emergency.
