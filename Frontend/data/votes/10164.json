    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes an appropriation of $900,000 from the Continuing Police Training (CPT) fund for the purchase of police cruisers to be used at the training academy for recruits.  Furthermore, this ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for the purchase of police cruisers, as well as associated up-fitting for the Departments of Public Safety. The purchase orders for the police cruiser purchases, computers, up-fittings and installation will be issued from Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) that have been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. \n \nIn accordance with the aforementioned, this ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders from various UTCs, including but not limited to, George Byers Sons Inc, (PA007291) for the acquisition of police cruisers, Law and Order Technology, LLC (PA007267)for the purchase of computers and accessories, Parr Public Safety Equipment Inc (PA005485 & PA005547) for the associated purchase of police vehicle up-fitting. These vehicles are to be purchased for training. Currently, the Division pulls 15 cruisers from the regular fleet for training that requires a cruiser. These trainings are drivers training, Patrol Practicals, Deadly Force Encounters, Stops and Approaches, etc. These classes require cruisers to be in use for several months throughout the year. The purchase will alleviate the wear and tear on front-line cruisers. \n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, vendor#006008, PA007291 - Light Duty Trucks & Police Vehicles - expires 6/30/27\nLaw and Order Technology, LLC, vendor#040906, PA007267- Computers & Access. - expires 4/30/2027\nParr Public Safety Equipment Inc, vendor#001060, PA005485 and PA005547 - Safety Up Fit Service & Emergency Lights UTC - expire 12/30/24 & 11/30/2024 respectively\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for price increases of previously ordered vehicles. These include but are not limited to vehicle model year change, increase in materials cost, freight charges for delivery, fuel up charges or any other increased cost associated with the procurement of the previously ordered vehicle. \n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the sam.gov or prohibited from being awarded a contract as per the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance seeks authority to appropriate and expend $900,000.00 from CPT Fund for the acquisition of police cruisers and related up-fitting parts/services for the Division of Police.  There are funds for these purchases in the CPT Fund. \n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicle order windows to open and close, at random, with little to no notice. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that orders can be placed as soon as possible. \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of police cruisers, computers, and vehicle up-fitting needs for training purposes for the Division of Police; to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to establish purchase orders for additional vehicle costs, model year changes, or cost increases; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $900,000.00 from the CPT Fund; and to declare an emergency.
