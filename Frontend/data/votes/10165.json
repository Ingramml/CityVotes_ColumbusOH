    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Office entered into a contract with Alban & Alban LLP for title services on March 1, 2024, for up to $40,000.00. This legislation authorizes the City Attorney to modify and extend (Modification No. 1) the current contract to February 28, 2025, and to declare an emergency in order to ensure the Property Action Team has continued title services that are necessary for nuisance abatement litigation.\n \nBACKGROUND: The Columbus City Attorney’s Office has a contract with Alban & Alban LLP from March 1, 2024 to August 8, 2024 that requires a modification for additional funds. The original contract was an estimate based on the anticipated bidding of title services at some point during the year. Bidding has not yet occurred, so a modification of the existing contract is necessary to ensure continued title services that are necessary for nuisance abatement litigation.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The amount of the contract modification is $40,000.00, and the total amount of this contract, as modified, is $80,000.00. This contract modification will be funded by the Environmental Fund.\n \nOriginal contract amount $40,000.00 (PO428096) \n(current balance of contract PO: $6,836.00)\nModification No. 1 amount $40,000.00 (This Ordinance)\nTotal contract amount $80,000.00\n \nCOMPANY: Alban & Alban LLP, FID: 31-1315799, CC-005040, expires 05/01/2026 \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify and extend an existing contract with Alban & Alban LLP; to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the Environmental Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($40,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, on March 1, 2024, the City Attorney’s Office entered into a contract with Alban & Alban LLP in an amount not to exceed $40,000.00 to provide title services for our Property Action Team; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney has identified the need to modify and extend to 2/28/2025 an existing contract with Alban & Alban LLP, for title services in an amount up to $80,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operations of the Columbus City Attorney’s Office to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and expend these funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Attorney’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Attorney to modify the existing contract with Alban & Alban LLP, because bidding has not yet occurred and the modification is immediately necessary to ensure continued title services that are necessary for nuisance abatement litigation.; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Attorney be and is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with Alban & Alban LLP, in the amount of $40,000.00, bringing the contract total to $80,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purposes stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $40,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby authorized in Fund 2297 (Environmental Fund), 24-2401 (City Attorney), in object class 03 (Purchased services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3. That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Codes Chapter 329 relating to contract modifications.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish such accounting codes as necessary, to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements, contracts, or modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure because insufficient funds remain under the current contract and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
