    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Public Safety Director, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to establish a purchase order with Make A Point Apparel Printing, LLC, an authorized vendor, for the purchase of custom T-shirts for distribution to participants of the “Citizen Responder - Safe a Life; Don’t Take a Life” program.\n \nColumbus' opportunity neighborhoods see a disproportionate loss of life from sudden cardiac arrest, trauma from gunshot wounds, and drug overdoses compared to the City as a whole. There is a need for enhanced community intervention to provide acute care prior to emergency medical personnel’s arrival. Opportunity neighborhoods also experience higher rates of violence among young people. There is an opportunity to engage these young people as community responders to save lives instead of taking them. Citizen Responders are specially trained young people, armed with the knowledge and ability to provide lifesaving care before emergency medical services arrive. This program focuses on providing at-risk youth with training in C.P.R., Narcan administration, Stop the Bleed, and basic first aid training so they can be empowered to save a life. This training will be provided by the Division of Fire’s RREACT team in the city’s designated “high-crime” areas. The goal is to provide this training to 300 youth this summer. The T-shirts will be distributed to young people who complete the training.\nThe vendor is:\nMake A Point Apparel Printing LLC.
