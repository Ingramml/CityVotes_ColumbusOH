BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities (DPU) to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Hazen & Sawyer for the Residuals Management Plan Update, CIP #690540-100001, in an amount up to $500,000.00 for Division of Water Contract No. 2414.\n \nResiduals are materials removed from water during the water treatment process.  Water treatment facilities produce large volumes of residuals on a daily basis that must be continuously disposed of or reused.  Any disruption to the residuals handling operation can result in a shutdown to the water treatment system; thus, residuals handling is a critical component of the City’s water supply system.  This contract is necessary to provide assistance to obtain turnkey beneficial use services of these water treatment residuals so the Division of Water (DOW) can continue to provide a long-term and reliable water supply to the Central Ohio area.\nWork performed to date under the contract included assistance with developing procurement documents for turnkey dewatering services; evaluating the resulting proposals; developing contract documents for the turnkey services; contract negotiations with the turnkey vendor; and providing engineering services during construction of the dewatering facility.  The work to be performed under this contract modification includes surveying and associated services to continue engineering services during construction; performing services for property splitting and assemblage for the McKinley Avenue Quarry (MAQ) dewatering facility; and obtaining a beneficial use permit for the water treatment residuals.  These services are necessary to dewater, store, haul, and beneficially reuse water treatment residuals (WTR). \n \nPlanning Area is Citywide - 99.\n \nTIMELINE:  The initial contract started in June 2020.  This is the second of three planned contract modifications. This modification is anticipated to provide services through the second quarter of 2025.  There is one future modification planned, with the contract projected to run through the end of 2027.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $500,000.00\n \nCost summary: \n \nInitial Contract (Study) (PO230073; ORD 0966-2020)                                                                                                               $229,000.00\nEngineering Services During Construction - First contract modification (PO372951; ORD 0056-2023)                     $500,000.00\nEngineering Services During Construction (Current Modification #2)                                                                     $500,000.00\nEngineering Services During Construction (Future Modification #3)                                                                     $500,000.00\nESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                               $1,729,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funds for future phases of the project.  This modification is one of the planned contract modifications.  A new procurement process is not required to add these funds to continue the contract.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe services needed and the level of effort were discussed with the consultant and an estimated cost was determined for the anticipated services. This estimated cost was projected through the duration of this contract modification using existing contract job tiles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The City Project Manager and associated staff negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDisruption to the residuals handling operation can result in a shutdown to the water treatment system; thus, residuals handling is a critical component of the City’s water supply system.  This project is necessary to continue to provide a long-term and reliable water supply to the Central Ohio area.\n \n3.
