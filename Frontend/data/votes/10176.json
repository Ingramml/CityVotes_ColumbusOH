    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services for detailed design and bidding services with Prime AE Group, Inc. for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) Stormwater Pump Station ST-29 Evaluation & Upgrade project, CIP #611660-100029, in an amount up to $596,628.73 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nThe scope of work for this contract will generally include a complete assessment, evaluation, and refurbishment of Stormwater Pump Station ST-29 so that it can remain in service for the next 20 years with only routine maintenance. The building structure and the systems and equipment within may need refurbishment to some degree, including but not limited to pumps and motors, electrical and power generating equipment, security systems, instruments and controls, wet well structures, the sewer pipes within the boundaries of the site, electrical cabling and duct banks, parking lots, grounds and fences, and HVAC systems. This refurbishment must bring the pump station into compliance with all current building and safety codes.\n \nThe initial phase of this contract provided Professional Engineering Services for Preliminary Design (Step 1), which included the following tasks: a review of the existing pump station; a condition assessment and evaluation of the existing pump station; identification and evaluation of design alternatives; development of design criteria and basis of design; and preparation of a Detailed Design Memorandum (Preliminary Design Report (PDR)). \n \nFor this second phase, a modification to the original Professional Engineering Services Agreement is requested for Step 2, Detailed Design Engineering and Bidding Services. Detailed Design will prepare construction contract documents (including specifications and drawings) in accordance with City of Columbus Division of Sewerage and Drainage standards, guidelines, and direction for construction and implementation of the proposed facility. Detailed Design will also include plan and specification review meetings, assisting in negotiations, permitting, and other matters with the Ohio EPA and other government agencies as necessary, and bidding services (which includes assisting at the Pre-Bid Meeting, reviewing the bids, making an award recommendation for lowest and best bid, and preparing Conformed to Contract documents.)\n \nUpon award of the construction contract, another modification to the Professional Engineering Services Agreement will be requested for Step 3, Engineering Services During Construction, which will include Technical Project Representation (TPR) duties, construction phase engineering, start-up and commissioning assistance, and record documentation. \n \nThe Community Area for this project is 59.\n \n1.1.  Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $596,628.73\nCost summary: \nOriginal Engineering Agreement (ORD 0577-2022; PO328769)                                                                                         $151,817.48\nModification No. 1 (current)                                                                                                                                                                                                                 $596,628.73 \nProposed Modification No. 2 (for Engineering Services during Construction)                                                     $414,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                                                                    $1,162,446.21\n \n1.2.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process for engineering services through the completion of the construction of the project.  Planned contract modifications were anticipated to add funds for stages of design.  This is one of those planned contract modifications so a new procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3.  How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by Prime AE Group, Inc., based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe performance of this project’s activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s Stormwater Pump Station ST-29 is needed to plan improvements to maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the stormwater collection system and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nPrime AE Group, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC002102 and expires 2/24/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Prime AE Group, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Prime AE Group, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 34.0%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Prime AE Group, Inc. has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nDynotec, Inc.                                                                                          Columbus, OH                                                                                    MBE\nArcadis U.S., Inc.                                                                         Columbus, OH                                                                                    MAJ\nMoody Engineering                                                                       Columbus, OH                                                                                    MBE\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                           Columbus, OH                                                                                    MBE\nDonahue Ideas, LLC                                                                    Columbus, OH                                                                                    WBE\nDHDC Engineering Consulting                                            Columbus, OH                                                                                   MBE\nWade Trim                                                                                             Cleveland, OH                                                                                     MAJ\n \nThe certification of Prime AE Group, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the July Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application. \n \nFunds will need to be appropriated in the Storm - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6224.\n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Prime AE Group, Inc. for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Prime AE Group, Inc. and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Prime AE Group, Inc. for the DOSD Stormwater Pump Station ST-29 Evaluation & Upgrade project;
