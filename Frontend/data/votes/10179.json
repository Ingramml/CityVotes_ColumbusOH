    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the Blueprint Milford Summit Area Integrated Solutions, CIP #650870-110165, in an amount up to $442,689.50.\n \nThe City of Columbus and the State of Ohio entered into a consent order in August of 2002 to resolve sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) related concerns for the City’s sanitary sewer system.  The consent order requires the City to develop and implement a program to provide adequate capacity in the collection system, taking all feasible steps to address SSO’s.  This project is required to comply with Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s consent order requiring mitigation of Design Sewer Relief (DSR) activations to the 10-yr level of service.  The City proposes to accomplish this via elimination of inflow and infiltration into the sanitary sewer system, and the construction of green infrastructure to capture and treat the resulting stormwater runoff.\n \nTo date, the consultant has conducted the required field investigations, property investigations, and alternative analysis to determine the preferred alternative within the project area. The consultants have used this data for the report and to assemble the 30% plans. They are currently working towards their 60% plan submittal.\n \nFuture work will concentrate on finalizing the project construction plans, assembling the construction documents, bidding the work, and conducting engineering services during construction.\n \nThe Community Area is Clintonville - 39.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $442,689.50\nOriginal Contract:                     $699,974.42 (ORD 3357-2016; PO053177)\nRenewal #1:                     $442,689.50\nRenewal #2 (estimated):                     $200,000.00\nTOTAL                     $1,342,663.92\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process for engineering services through the completion of the construction of the project.  Planned contract modifications were anticipated to add funds for stages of design.  This is one of those planned contract modifications so a new procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by Stantec Consulting Services Inc., based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable. \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThe use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly systems, commonly referred to as “green” infrastructure, has been recognized and implemented in many communities as a potential solution to various elements associated with EPA consent order requirements. Green infrastructure also provides additional storm water treatment benefits, potentially mitigating street flooding and impacts on receiving streams.\n \nIt is anticipated that the construction of green infrastructure will positively impact the local economy by creating the need for personnel to construct and maintain the proposed facilities, as well as by sourcing project-related materials from local suppliers and vendors. Community outreach for the project will be conducted by the City via public meetings upon completion of a Preliminary Design Report and accompanying draft plans. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nHDR Engineering, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC008851 and expires 3/11/26.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  HDR Engineering, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  HDR Engineering, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of sub-consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 4.5%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, HDR Engineering, Inc. has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                City/State               ODI Certification Status\nResource International, Inc.                               Columbus, Ohio                                                               WBE\nDHDC Engineering Consulting Services, Inc.     Columbus, Ohio                                                               MBE\nEMH&T                                                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nArcadis Inc.                                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\n \nThe certification of HDR Engineering, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the August Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application.  Funds will need to be appropriated in the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124.\n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to HDR Engineering, Inc. for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to HDR Engineering, Inc. and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a professional engineering services contract with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the Blueprint Milford Summit Area Integrated Solutions project;
