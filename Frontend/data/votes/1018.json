    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to appropriate $19,960.00 within the Public Safety Initiative subfund to the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, in order to train youth on how to provide lifesaving care prior to emergency medical personnel’s arrival and to purchase tourniquets for this training, to authorize a transfer to the general fund, as well as an expenditure of $19,960.00 from the general fund.\n \nColumbus’s opportunity neighborhoods see disproportionate loss of life from sudden cardiac arrest, trauma from gunshot wounds, and drug overdoses compared to the City as a whole. There is a need for enhanced community intervention to provide acute care prior to emergency medical personnel’s arrival. Opportunity neighborhoods also experience higher rates of violence among young people. There is an opportunity to engage these young people as community responders to save lives instead of taking them. Citizen Responders are specially trained young people armed with the knowledge and ability to provide lifesaving care before emergency medical services arrive. This program focuses on providing at-risk youth with training in C.P.R., Narcan, Stop the Bleed, and basic first aid training so they can be empowered to save a life. \n \nThe goal of this program is to train 300 youth in the Citizen Responder curriculum over the summer.   \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Total appropriation is $19,960.00 and is available in the 2021 budget within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100016.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested in order to receive the funds to continue running the program. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation of $19,960.00 in the Public Safety Initiatives subfund to the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Columbus Division of Fire, in order to train youth in the Citizen Responder Program on how to provide lifesaving care prior to emergency medical personnel’s arrival and to purchase tourniquets for this training; and to declare an emergency.
