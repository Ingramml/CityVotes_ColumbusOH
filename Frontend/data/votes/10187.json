    "description": "Explanation\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC for the purchase of a Studio Network Systems server hardware for Media Services.\n \nThe Department of Technology, Media Services, amasses thousands of hours of digital media content annually to produce meeting coverage, promos, PSAs and event documentation. In an attempt to better catalogue, search, and retain these assets, Media Services is requesting a dedicated Media Asset Management platform and associated server hardware. This solution, a Studio Network Systems 16 Bay 60.8TB SSD EVO Head & 128TB HDD Expansion Chassis, will act as a centralized media repository for all content acquired and managed by Media Services. It will also streamline the current workflow and improve collaboration between other city departments and partners.\n \nThis ordinance also requests approval for the above purchase via a waiver of relevant sections of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code relating to competitive bidding. A bid waiver is needed due to an error in advertising RFQ027519 and bid was received by the Department of Technology instead of the Department of Finance and Management.  The Department of Technology informally solicited bids from multiple vendors and ultimately received three (3) bids.  Upon review, it is recommended that Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC be selected as the vendor of choice.\n \nBidder                                                                                                                                                                        Bid Amount                                          MAJ/ODI Certification\nBrown Enterprise Solutions, LLC                                                                                    $113,228.44                                          MBE\nIvideo Technologies LLC                                                                                                         $118,011.10                                          MAJ\nvPrime Tech                                                                                                                                                   $119,364.12                                          MAJ\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this purchase are budgeted and available under the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, in the Information Services GO Debt Fund.
