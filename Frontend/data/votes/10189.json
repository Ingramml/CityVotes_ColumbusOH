($3,493,584.59)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the agreement with Moody Nolan, Inc., for Architect-of-Record Services for the New Municipal Court Building project, in the amount of $3,493,584.59.\n \nModification No. 1 (current) is needed to perform schematic design of the New Municipal Court Building.  The schematic design will include development of the final selected building concept.  This will include preliminary code summary and life safety plans, preliminary site plans, preliminary block diagrams, massing studies, preliminary structural / mechanical / plumbing / electrical and fire protection plans and narrative.  Schematic design of the tunnel will also be included.  Renderings will also be provided.  Additional services also include: Phase 2 underground utility locations, geotechnical engineering and soil borings, Phase 2 environmental assessment, and hazardous materials assessment.  The duration of scope of work is 20 weeks.  \n \nThe original agreement (PO397905) was authorized by Ordinance No. 1248-2023 and approved by City Council on May 22, 2023. \n \n1.1                     The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: $3,493,584.59\n \n1.2  Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  The need for a modification was foreseen and noted in the original ordinance 1248-2023.  \n \n1.3  Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?  The current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the work to date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project and put the City at risk of not meeting project schedules and deadlines.\n \n1.4  How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined.  The City received a quote from Moody Nolan, Inc. and was approved by the project manager.\n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  DAX No. 4920, expires 3/15/26, MBE\n \n3. FUTURE MODIFICATIONS:  The scope and scale of this project entails ongoing modifications throughout the design phase and eventually into construction.  There will be future modifications to the design contract.  One for design development/construction document stage and another for construction administration stage.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT:  There are sufficient funds within the Construction Management Taxable Bonds Fund - Fund No. 7732 for this expenditure.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the agreement with Moody Nolan, Inc. for Architect-of-Record Services for the New Municipal Court Building project; and to authorize an expenditure of $3,493,584.59 from the Construction Management Taxable Bonds Fund. ($3,493,584.59)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO397905 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1248-2023 and approved by City Council on May 22, 2023, for Architect-of-Record Services for the New Municipal Court Building project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and increase the agreement with Moody Nolan, Inc. to provide funding for schematic design of the New Municipal Court Building project; and \n \nWHEREAS, the scope and scale of this project entails ongoing modifications throughout the design phase and eventually into construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure up to $3,493,584.59 within the Construction Management Taxable Bonds Fund; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management, Office of Construction Management, to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify and increase the agreement for Architect-of-Record Services for the New Municipal Court Building project; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, is hereby authorized to modify and increase the agreement, with Moody Nolan, Inc., for Architect-of-Record Services for the New Municipal Court Building project, in an amount up to $3,493,584.59.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $3,493,584.59, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in the Construction Management Taxable Bonds Fund - Fund No. 7732, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this Ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project account by monies from more than one source.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
