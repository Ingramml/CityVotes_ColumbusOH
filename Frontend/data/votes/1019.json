    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance, on behalf of Columbus City Council, to enter into a non-profit service contract with The Ohio State University College of Social Work in support of the Age-Friendly Columbus and Franklin County initiative.  \n \nAge-Friendly Columbus and Franklin County was created in 2016 and is a joint effort between the City of Columbus, Franklin County, and The Ohio State University College of Social Work to assesses the age-friendliness of the Columbus area and develop strategic plans to guide the City's and Central Ohio's efforts to promote a high quality of life for all residents, as well as to link aging residents with services provided by the City, County, OSU, and community partners.  \n \nIn the coming years, Age-Friendly will continue to work to increase resiliency, mobility, and inclusion among older adults in the community. It will decrease barriers to participation through increasing accessibility in the built environment, access to technology and internet, translation and interpretation services, and other potential barriers that arise.  Council is proposing funding for programs and staff time that will help accomplish these goals, as well as allowing Age Friendly to serve as a central access point for community engagement for the City of Columbus Departments of Public Service, Public Health, Recreation and Parks, Safety, Vision Zero, and others as needed.
