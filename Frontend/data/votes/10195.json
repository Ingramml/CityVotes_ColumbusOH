    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to contribute funding to Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) relative to the Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad BRT project. \nIn 2019, the City of Columbus, acting through the Department of Public Service, and COTA formed a collaborative relationship for the purpose of facilitating the design and construction of certain public infrastructure improvements to accommodate predicted population growth in key regional growth corridors through denser development and coordinated investments in “high-capacity transit”.\nThe Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad Corridor BRT project, which is being administered by COTA, is a 9.3-mile mobility infrastructure project to improve transit service along the Broad Street corridor, consisting of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and up to seventeen (17) enhanced BRT stations between Rockbrook Crossing Avenue/Doherty Road and Washington Avenue, including segments off Broad Street along Cleveland Avenue, Long Street, and Washington Avenue. This effort is aligned with other City-led projects in the area. \nThis legislation seeks to authorize the execution of a contribution agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, between the Department of Public Service and COTA and the expenditure of up to $5,500,000.00 to facilitate the design of the aforementioned improvements. \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for COTA is CC004318, which expired on July 2, 2021. COTA will be required to become contract compliant prior to the execution of the requisite contribution agreement. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this project is available as follows: $5,300,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund and $200,000.00 within the Storm Bond Fund.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund and between projects within the Storm Bond Fund also is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to facilitate the execution of the requisite contribution agreement by the parties on or before October 1, 2024, so as to maintain the project schedule established by COTA. \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund and between projects within the Storm Bond Fund;
