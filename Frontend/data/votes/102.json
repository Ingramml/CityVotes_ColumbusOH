    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Tyevco Inc. for the Goodale Park UIRF 2020 Improvements Project. The contract amount is $398,039.00, with a contingency of $39,461.00, for a total of $437,500.00. An additional $3,500.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $441,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nGoodale Park is a public park in the Victorian Village area of Columbus. It was donated to the city in 1851 by Lincoln Goodale. The Friends of Goodale Park, a non-profit community group, have been requesting improvements identified in this project and have been integrally involved in the development of this project. Improvements will include new water connections for irrigation of community gardens and plantings. New lighting along walkways will improve safety and re-lamping of existing lighting fixtures to LED will increase energy efficiency. The gazebo will also be renovated, improving the ADA access and the functional use of the facility for the public. We anticipate construction to begin in early 2021 and to be finished by late spring 2021. Funding has been identified through the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF). \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on October 27, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 19, 2020. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nTyevco Inc. (MAJ): $398,039.00\nR.W. Setterlin Building Company (MAJ): $435,200.00\nMiles-McClellan Construction Co. (MBE): $473,175.00                     \nPlayworld Midstates (MAJ): Not Responsive\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Tyevco Inc. was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Tyevco Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. It was determined that Playworld Midstates was not responsive in submitting form B5, which documents Subcontractors, per Columbus City Code Chapter 329\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTyevco, Inc.\n1678 West Audubon Blvd., Lancaster, Ohio 43130                                                      \nScott Boggess, 614-284-0251                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005691, 31-1626034\nAugust 19, 2021\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the contractor can begin work in early 2021 and be substantially complete with the work in the spring of 2021. The timing corresponds with the current closing of the shelterhouse and gazebo to accommodate these renovations, allowing the construction to occur when these facilities are not rented or in use.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project includes new water connections for irrigation of community gardens and plantings. New lighting along walkways will improve safety and re-lamping of existing lighting fixtures to LED will increase energy efficiency.
