    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the transfer of $338,000.00 between Departments within the General Fund for program operations related to the Batterer’s Intervention Program (BIP).  \n \nCurrently, the Franklin County Municipal Court out-sources programming related to its Batterer’s Intervention Programming and Intimate Partner Domestic Violence programs. These programs assess the risk and needs of each defendant and determine appropriate levels of treatment and proper levels of supervision and community control. \n \nThe current outsourced program has encountered certain barriers and constraints related to financial/economic burden, absenteeism, limited group/program offerings, communication with program participants, breadth and depth of aftercare and supportive services, and recidivism reduction. In-sourcing components of the program will allow the Franklin County Municipal Court more flexibility and financial resources to improve services and potential outcomes. Program enhancements would include free participation, and expanded program offerings to help remove barriers with respect to employment, childcare, and financial burden to help participants successfully complete the programming. These programmatic enhancements will help improve success rates and reduce recidivism.\n \nThe Office of Violence Prevention is partnering with the Franklin County Municipal Court and is providing the initial program funding via a transfer of funds from the Office of Violence Prevention to the Franklin County Municipal Court for 2024 program costs.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the transfer of $338,000.00 between Departments within the General Fund.\n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delay in implementing the Batterer’s Intervention Program.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer $338,000.00 between Departments within the General Fund for program operations related to the Batterer’s Intervention Program; and to declare an emergency ($338,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Office of Violence Prevention is dedicated to reducing and preventing violence of all forms within the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, Domestic violence affects Columbus residents of all ages, races, and genders; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Office of Violence Prevention is determined to support Mayor Ginther's vision to make Columbus the safest big city in America; and\n \nWHEREAS, The purpose of a batterers intervention program is to hold batterers accountable and to reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a recurring battery; and\n \nWHEREAS, Currently, the Franklin County Municipal Court outsources programming related to its Batterer’s Intervention Programming and Intimate Partner Domestic Violence programs; and\n \nWHEREAS, The current outsourced program has encountered certain barriers and constraints related to financial/economic burden, absenteeism, limited group/program offerings, communication with program participants, breadth and depth of aftercare and supportive services, and recidivism reduction; and\n \nWHEREAS, In-sourcing components of the program will allow the Franklin County Municipal Court more flexibility and financial resources to improve services and potential outcomes; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Office of Violence Prevention is partnering with the Franklin County Municipal Court and is providing the initial program funding via a transfer of funds from the Office of Violence Prevention to the Franklin County Municipal Court for 2024 program costs; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Violence Prevention in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the transfer of $338,000.00 between Departments within the General Fund for program operations related to the Batterer’s Intervention Program to avoid any delay in providing critical assistance in these areas of community need, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the transfer of $338,000.00 is hereby authorized within the General Fund 1000 in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2.
