    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for professional services and construction services for the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) & Harmonic Filter Upgrade project, CIP #650346-100002, in an amount up to $1,155,372.28. \n                     \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities’ (DPU) Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD) has identified numerous Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) and Harmonic Filters at several Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) processes that are nearing the end of their useful service life and are becoming increasingly difficult to repair and maintain. These processes include the fine screens, the Return Activated Sludge (RAS) pumps, the thickening centrifuges, and the skimmings concentrators. This project will provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate, replace, configure, and program the VFDs and harmonic filters, provide new controls that may be necessary to integrate the new equipment into the existing systems, and provide any other ancillary work to provide a fully functioning system. This work will also include recommendations for the standardization of equipment that can be used in the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) Guide Specifications and programming of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The equipment specified will vary based on site conditions, building use, building permit requirements, and ease of maintenance issues. Consideration shall be given to increasing ease of maintenance, development of standardized operating systems, and specifying control systems access software. This work is part of the City’s continuing effort to upgrade its treatment facilities, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety.\n \nThis contract provides professional engineering services necessary for the entire project including preliminary design, detailed design, services for construction procurement, and engineering services during construction. The original contract funding was for Step 1, Preliminary Design Services. Preliminary Design investigated the existing conditions, determined space limitations, and investigated and evaluated products that could be utilized. \n \nThis modification to the agreement will provide funding for the next phase, which is Step 2, Detailed Design and Bidding/Construction Procurement Services. During this phase, detailed construction contract documents will be developed to define the construction work. Construction contract documents will consist of drawings, specifications, and bidding documents based upon the City’s standards and preferences. Bidding services will follow detailed design and will occur during the advertisement, bid opening, and construction contract execution phase of the project. \n \nThe actual emplacement of the work will be by construction contract. Step 3, Engineering Services During Construction will be performed when the proposed improvements are being constructed. That phase of the engineering contract will provide construction-phase engineering, start-up and commissioning assistance, and record documentation preparation. It is anticipated that a future contract modification will be requested for this work. \n \nPlanning Area: 99 - Citywide\n \nTIMELINE:  Preliminary Design is anticipated to be complete in the second quarter of 2024. Step 2, Detailed Design Services will commence immediately after the Preliminary Design work is approved and after this modification (Mod. No. 1) is approved by City Council and executed. It is estimated that Detail Design will be completed during the third quarter of 2025. At the conclusion of the Detailed Design, it is estimated that the construction contract will be advertised and bid in third quarter of 2025 and awarded in late 2025 or early 2026. \n \nThe overall contract duration, from initiation of Preliminary Design Services to completion of Engineering Services During Construction, is estimated to be 48 months. The DP’s services will continue beyond completion of construction to provide “as-built” record drawings of the constructed facilities.\n \n1. ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The original engineering contract amount was $443,624.94.That amount was sufficient to complete Step 1, Preliminary Design Services. The amount of this modification (Modification No. 1) for Step 2, Detailed Design and Bidding Services is $1,155,372.28. One additional future contract modification for Step 3, Engineering Services During Construction is anticipated at this time.\n \nThe following is an estimate of costs for this contract:\n \nCost summary: \nOriginal Engineering Agreement (ORD 1320-2023; PO 395152)                                                                    $443,624.94\nModification No. 1 (current)                                                                                                                                                            $1,155,372.28 \nFuture Anticipated Costs                                                                                                                                                                                   $1,620,000.00                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      $3,218,997.22\n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe majority of the work included in this modification was planned and anticipated within the original procurement, but due to the highly complex and technical nature of this wastewater treatment plant project, it is not reasonable or cost efficient to undertake a new procurement effort to acquire independent design services. The lengthy process for initiating a new procurement and for a new entity to gain understanding of the project would likely cause an unacceptable project delay and additional cost.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by Arcadis U.S., Inc. and reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable. \n \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe performance of this project’s activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and replace VFDs and Harmonic Filters at SWWTP is needed to continue the City’s effort to upgrade its treatment facilities, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the City’s wastewater treatment system and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nTwo proposals was received:\n \nName                                               C.C. No.        Exp.
