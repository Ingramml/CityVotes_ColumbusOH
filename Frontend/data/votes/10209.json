    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with GPD Group for the Circuit 7221 Voltage Conversion Phase 2 Project, CIP #670799-100002, in an amount up to $1,142,148.00 for Division of Power.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Power (DOP), intends to complete the effort to eliminate the remaining portion of the distribution system based on a 7,200 Volt delta configuration by converting to a 14.4 kV grounded-wye system.  The existing 7,200 Volt delta system consists of three circuits, Circuits 7220, 7221, and 7223, that originate from the DOP’s 14.4 kV - 7,200 Volt North Substation. These three circuits are to be converted to 14.4 kV by extending the existing 14.4 kV circuits in the same areas, as necessary, to serve all existing DOP customers on these 7,200 Volt circuits. The existing 7,200 Volt equipment shall be replaced as needed, including but not limited to transformers, switches, surge arresters, and other line equipment. These projects will also include circuit extensions and equipment installations to make the DOP power distribution system more robust and reliable upon project completion.\n \nThe work to be performed under this contract includes project management, field survey, detailed design, preparation of construction drawings, obtaining any permits necessary for the work, engineering services during construction, and preparation of record plan drawings.\n \nThe initial contract funding was done to perform the scope of services included in Phase 1 of the 7221 Voltage Conversion. This the first planned contract modification to perform similar engineering work for Phase 2.  The work for Phases 3, 4, and 5 will be funded with future planned contract modifications.  DOP expects to issue Requests for Proposals to select an engineering firm to perform the engineering work on Circuits 7220 and 7223.\n \nThe Circuit 7221 Voltage Phase 2 project serves multiple planning areas so the Community Area is “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,142,148.00\nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract (ORD 3163-2023); PO431802)                               $586,042.00\n                     Phase 2 (current)                                                                                                                   $1,142,148.00\n                     Phase 3 (Future)                                                                                                                   $1,230,000.00\n                     Phase 4 (Future)                                                                                                                   $1,320,000.00\n                     Phase 5 (Future)                                                                                                                   $1,410,000.00\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                   $5,688,190.00\n \n1.2  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process for engineering services through the completion of the construction of the project.  Planned contract modifications were anticipated to add funds for stages of design.  This is one of those planned contract modifications so a new procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3  How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by GPD Group based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis project will construct a more resilient and reliable power distribution system.  This will result in fewer power interruptions to the customers on these circuits which will minimize any economic impacts due to power outages.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nGPD Group’s contract compliance number is CC-006560 and expires 5/24/2025. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was assigned an MBE/WBE Program goal of 10%.  This goal applies to the original contract amount and all contract modifications.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, GPD Group proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                      City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nDynotec, Inc.                                                                                     Columbus, OH                                                                                            MBE\n \nThe certification of GPD Group and the above listed company was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,142,148.00 is available and appropriated within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with GPD Group for the Circuit 7221 Voltage Conversion Phase 2 Project; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $1,142,148.00 from the Electricity Bond Fund to pay for the contract modification.  ($1,142,148.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Circuit 7221 Voltage Conversion Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO431802 was authorized by Ordinance No. 3163-2023 for the Circuit 7221 Voltage Conversion Phase 1 Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract modification is needed to fund the next phase of engineering services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the professional engineering services agreement with GPD Group for the Circuit 7221 Voltage Conversion Project for the purpose of adding funds to continue work on the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds from the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, to pay for the contract renewal; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the transfer of $542,148.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized between projects between within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify and increase the professional engineering services contract with GPD Group, 1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210, Columbus, OH 43215; for the Circuit 7221 Voltage Conversion project, in an amount up to $1,142,148.00.\n \nSECTION 3.  That an expenditure of $1,142,148.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, to pay for this contract modification per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 7.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
