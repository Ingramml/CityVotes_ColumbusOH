    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Wade Trim, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) A-Plant Secondary Clarifier Electrical Upgrades & Miscellaneous Improvements, CIP #650245-100002, in an amount up to $1,741,676.74.\n \nDue to the corrosive environment and age, electrical equipment at the JPWWTP associated with the secondary treatment process such as electrical conduits, supports, wiring, and collector drives for the secondary clarifiers are in poor condition. This project will upgrade electrical equipment and associated appurtenances responsible for the secondary treatment process.\n \nPreliminary design has been completed on the engineering services contract for this project.  A planned modification to fund detailed design is now needed. This phase of the contract will include 30%, 60%, and 95% detailed design plans along with review meetings for the Jackson Pike A-Plant Secondary Clarifiers and associated equipment. The ACA Secondary Clarifiers, MCC’s, VFD’s, HVAC, electrical lighting, Backup Flushing Water System, Dilution Water System, A-Plant effluent sampling, and MLSS & RAS channel have all been evaluated during preliminary design.  Detailed design will provide a biddable set of plans to implement the required upgrades.  \n \nThe community planning are for this project is 59 - SouthWest \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,741,676.74\nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract (ORD 1942-2023; PO405624)                                                  $766,156.05\n                     Proposed Renewal #1 (Current)                                                               $1,741,676.74\n                     Future Renewal #2 (Estimate)                                                                  $1,320,000.00\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                        $3,827,832.79\n \n1.2 Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process for engineering services through the completion of the construction of the project.  Planned contract modifications were anticipated to add funds for stages of design.  This is one of those planned contract modifications so a new procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3 How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by GPD Group based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will include improvements that will help address corrosion and odor associated with the current process, as well as upgrade equipment and overall rehabilitate an outdated system. The Secondary process is a crucial process in treating wastewater and keeping our community and rivers clean. This process is one of the final steps in the treatment process for the wet stream and removes biological settle-able solids to reduce harmful parameters in the plants final effluent. Failure of this equipment would cease collection of the settle-able solids in the secondary clarifiers, which would then fill with solids that would overflow from the secondary tanks and eventually end up in the effluent, ultimately resulting in a violation and potential hazards. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nWade Trim, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC040053 and expires 11/29/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Wade Trim, Inc.\n \n4.
