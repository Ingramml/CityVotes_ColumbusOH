    "description": "Explanation\n \nZone In Columbus is a multi-phase effort to update the City’s Zoning Code and Map to provide a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development and growth.  Zone In proposes that a new 2024 Zoning Code be established under Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes.  The process for undertaking code and mapping changes proposed as part of this effort was outlined in Ordinance 0830-2024.  Over time, all aspects of the existing Title 33 Zoning Code will be replaced or moved to Title 34.  Resolution 0179X-2023, approved by City Council on October 9, 2023, outlined goals and priorities for the first phase of this effort.  Prepared by a team of City staff and consultants, the initial phase of this work entitled, “Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors”, was presented to City Council for their consideration in early April.\n \nPhase One includes both code and map recommendations, proposing that 12,300± parcels along 140 miles of the City’s major corridors be rezoned from existing Title 33 zoning districts to one of six new mixed-use 2024 Zoning Code district designations.  The proposal also responds to a central project objective of creating a more accessible, user-friendly code by establishing a new numbering system and organizational framework, as well as incorporating graphic illustrations to assist in code navigation. \n \nOn April 8, 2024, City Council approved Resolution #0088-2024, accepting the proposal and initiating a sixty-day public comment period.  Notice to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public was provided through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, social media, and project website updates. An interactive Zone In Gallery was open to the community throughout the comment period, allowing for in-person visits to learn more and provide feedback.  Additionally, three public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7, 2024; June 6, 2024; and June 27, 2024, wherein the general public could provide further comment on the proposal.  Over 1,800 comments were received during the sixty-day review period.  \n \nThis ordinance is required to allow for the new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code to use a different numbering system than is currently required by City Code Section 115.07 in order to address the Administration and Council’s desire that the updated zoning code be easier to use and navigate and to allow other provisions of the City Code to be transferred, and/or future provisions to be added, to this type of numbering system.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Chapter 115 of the Columbus City Codes to allow for an additional numbering system when classifying provisions of the City Code.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus embarked upon the Zone In Initiative with the goal of creating a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development, and growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the first phase of this multi-phase effort is entitled Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors; and\n \nWHEREAS, a public review and comment period focused on this proposal, initiated by City Council through Resolution 0088X-2024, has now concluded; and\n \nWHEREAS, additional ordinances have been submitted enacting the updated Phase One proposal, including a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code and series of zoning map amendments; and\n \nWHEREAS, Zone In calls for creation of a new 2024 Zoning Code within Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to be more user-friendly and navigable, the 2024 Zoning Code incorporates a new numbering system and organizational framework which are not currently permitted under the current City Code classification system, therefore it is necessary to amend City Code Section 115.07 to allow for this additional numbering system; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That City Code Section 115.07 shall be amended as follows:\n \n115.07 - Classification of city codes amendments.\n \n(A)                     In giving official supplemental city codes numbers, new legislation shall be integrated with the original city codes in conformity with the following classification plan: Each component code shall be codified within titles which shall be subdivided into articles; each article shall be subdivided into chapters; and each chapter shall be subdivided into sections which shall be numbered in accordance with the numbering system adopted by the Bureau of Code Revision of Ohio, established by the 96th General Assembly, for the Ohio Revised Code, as may be adaptable to the requirements of the City. \n(B)                     The numbering of all sections except the penalty sections shall be consecutive within each chapter commencing with the first section of Chapter 101, which is numbered 101.01, the first \"1\" signifying Code 1, the two figures \"01\" before the decimal signifying the chapter within the Code, and the two figures \"01\" after the decimal signifying the first section in Chapter 101 of Title One - Administrative Code. Conforming to the State decimal numbering system, three or more digits to the right of the decimal shall be used when necessary to locate new sections in their proper sequence. Penalty sections shall be designated \"99\" and shall be the last section of the chapter.\n(C)                     An alternative classification plan as provided for in this division may be employed where a greater degree of classification is needed.  The following numbering system may be used: \n(1).                     Article commencing with a capital letter starting with (A), then Chapter commencing with (.10), then Section commencing with (.010), then Division commencing with an upper-case letter beginning with (A), then Subdivision commencing with number (1), then sub-subdivisions commencing with a lower-case letter beginning with (a).  \n \n(2).                     Example:\n\nSECTION 2. That the previous City Code Section 115.07 is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
