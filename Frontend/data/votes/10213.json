    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe Zone In Columbus Initiative is a multi-phase effort to update the City’s Zoning Code and Map to provide a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development and growth.  Zone In proposes that a new 2024 Zoning Code be established under Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes.  The process for undertaking code and mapping changes proposed as part of this effort was outlined in Ordinance 0830-2024, approved by City Council on March 25, 2024.  The first phase of Zone In focuses on the creation and application of six new pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use zoning districts.  Over time, all aspects of the existing Title 33 Zoning Code will be replaced or moved to Title 34.  \n \nResolution 0179X-2023, approved by City Council on October 9, 2023, outlined goals and priorities for the first phase of this effort.  Prepared by a team of City staff and consultants, the “Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors” was presented to City Council for their consideration in early April.  The submission includes both code and map updates, proposing that certain parcels along 140 miles of the City’s major corridors be rezoned from existing Title 33 zoning districts to one of six new mixed-use 2024 Zoning Code district designations.  \n \nOn April 8, 2024, City Council approved Resolution #0088-2024, accepting the proposal and initiating a sixty-day public comment period.  Notice to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public was provided through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, social media, and project website updates.  An interactive Zone In Gallery was open to the community throughout the comment period, allowing for in-person visits to learn more and provide feedback.  Additionally, three public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7, 2024; June 6, 2024; and June 27, 2024, wherein the general public could provide further comment on the proposal.  Comments received during the review period contributed to updates to the proposed code, which is the subject of a separate ordinance. Additionally, a separate ordinance has been submitted rezoning 12,300± parcels into six new zoning district designations outlined in the updated code.\n \nThe evolving nature of the new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code requires that it work in conjunction with certain administrative and technical elements of the existing Title 33 Zoning Code.  This ordinance enacts changes to Title 33 necessary for the effective and efficient implementation of the 2024 Zoning Code.  Examples of Title 33 sections called out for applicability to the new code include chapters covering administration, map amendments, variances, off-street parking, and graphics.  Other changes to Title 33 include provisions removing commercial overlay designations in places where new Title 34 mixed-use districts are established.  Additional amendments ensure that parcels rezoned to new Title 34 districts falling within the East Franklinton District (Chapter 3323) and University District Zoning Overlay (Chapter 3325) continue to be subject to design review requirements outlined in Title 33.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend various provisions of Title 33 of the Columbus City Codes and to enact Chapter 3304 to provide for the effective and efficient implementation of the 2024 Zoning Code; to repeal various existing provisions of Title 33; and to address necessary code clean-up.  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus embarked on the Zone In initiative with the goal of creating a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development, and growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, Zone In calls for the creation of a new 2024 Zoning Code to be codified within newly enacted Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, the first phase of this multi-phase effort is entitled “Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors”; and\n \nWHEREAS, a public review and comment period focused on this proposal, initiated by City Council through Resolution 0088X-2024, has now concluded; and\n \nWHEREAS, additional ordinances have been submitted enacting the updated Phase One proposal, including a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code (Ordinance #2112-2024) and a series of zoning map amendments; and\n \nWHEREAS, over time, Title 34 is intended to replace the existing Title 33 Zoning Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, in the meantime, the 2024 Zoning Code relies on key elements of Title 33; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance would enact those changes to Title 33 necessary for the effective and efficient implementation of the 2024 Zoning Code; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
