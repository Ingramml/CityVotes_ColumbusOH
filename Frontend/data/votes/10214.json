    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe Zone In Columbus Initiative is a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and Official Zoning Map aimed at providing a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development and growth. Zone In was launched in response to a number of problems identified in a 2021 assessment of the current zoning code.  In the Spring of 2023, the “Where Do We Begin” report identified that the initial phase of Zone In should focus on 140 miles of key corridors. These “Main Streets” were identified as having the greatest potential to deliver critically needed housing, support enhanced mobility options, and create employment opportunities in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable.  The report identified “Main Street” locations based on a number of factors including existing land use and development policy; current base zoning and overlays, existing conditions; proximity to current and planned public transportation, specifically COTA routes and proposed LinkUS bus rapid transit alignments; and site-specific circumstances.  \n \nThe City of Columbus’ Zone-In Team, consisting of subject matter experts in planning and zoning, including lead consultant, Lisa Wise Consulting Inc., began development of new pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use zoning districts in 2023. This process involved extensive technical analysis, policy review, and community engagement.  Outreach included community conversations, in-person presentations to area commissions and other community groups, social media and email distribution lists, webinars, and a project website.  The process also benefited from the active engagement of the Zone In Advisory Committee.  Comprised of a diverse membership with expertise in neighborhood, civic, development, and equity disparity issues, the committee’s guidance was particularly instrumental in the formulation of Phase One priorities, which were identified as focusing on housing, mobility, urban design, equity, and supporting local businesses. These priorities and overall project goals were endorsed by City Council on October 9, 2023 through passage of Resolution #0179X-2023. \n \nThe project priorities, and strategies to address them, were featured in a series of community workshops in the fall of 2023.  A mailing to 78,000 property owners and tenants within and adjacent to the identified focus area corridors, provided notice of the project.  A digital survey, launched in conjunction with the workshops, garnered 6,600 responses.  The feedback received from these and prior efforts contributed to the formulation of the Phase One proposal. \n \nOn March 25, 2024, in anticipation of the proposal, City Council approved Ordinance #0830-2024, amending Chapter 3310 and outlining the plan to create a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code of the Columbus City Codes.  The 2024 Zoning Code will work in conjunction with the existing Title 33 Zoning Code. Over time, all aspects of existing Title 33 will be revised or replaced as they are moved to Title 34. Changes to Chapter 3310 also laid out the process to rezone parcels with existing Title 33 zoning district designations to new 2024 Zoning Code districts.\n \nOn April 4, 2024, Mayor Ginther presented the “Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors” to City Council.  The submission included code language for the new 2024 Zoning Code, outlining six new mixed-use zoning districts and maps depicting their allocation in the rezoning of 12,300± parcels along the focus area corridors.  \n \nOn April 8, 2024, City Council approved Resolution #0088-2024, accepting the proposal and initiating a sixty-day public comment period.  Notice was provided to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, and social media.  The proposed code and map were made available on the project website and as part of an interactive Zone In Gallery, allowing for area and code section specific input.  Open throughout the comment period, the Zone In Gallery hosted over 1,500 in-person visits from property owners, residents, stakeholder groups and others seeking to learn about the proposal and provide feedback.  Public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7 and June 6, 2024, allowing for further public input. \n \nOver 1,800 comments were received during the sixty-day public review period.  This input was summarized in a third public hearing, held on June 27, 2024. Comments received during this time were considered in updating the Phase One proposal, now presented for City Council adoption.  Exhibit B provides a summary of these changes and a red text version of the code showing areas of modification, and is attached as a supplement to this legislation. Highlights include additional language underscoring that zoning standards addressing building scale and design are subject to the design review process as applied by historic and design review bodies; greater emphasis on landscaping and screening, and technical edits intended to aid in code implementation.\n \nThis ordinance adopts Title 34: 2024 Zoning Code, attached hereto as Exhibit A. The new code includes six new pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use zoning districts and corresponding allowable uses, objective design standards for new development, and general site development standards.  Provisions are also included to address pre-existing uses and buildings and an affordable housing height bonus. The proposed code also removes vehicle parking minimums in conjunction with a Parking Impact Study system to evaluate and mitigate offsite impacts - the subject of a companion ordinance amending Title 43. Companion ordinances have been submitted to rezone 12,300± parcels to the new 2024 Zoning Code district designations; amend Title 1 to allow for use of a new numbering and organizational framework; and to enact amendments to Title 33 that support the implementation of the new 2024 Zoning Code.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo supplement the Columbus City Codes by the enactment of a new Title 34, entitled “2024 Zoning Code.” \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus embarked on the Zone In initiative, a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and map, with the goal of creating a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development, and growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Zone In team conducted extensive analysis of existing conditions, development patterns, area and community plans, and citywide policy direction in formulating code and map recommendations for the first phase of this work; and \n \nWHEREAS, recommendations were further shaped by thousands of points of community engagement generated through presentations, mailings to property owners and tenants, area commission visits, workshops, emails, digital surveys, website resources, and social media; and\n \nWHEREAS, this work was further guided by goals and priorities, reflecting the active engagement of a Zoning Advisory Committee and approved by City Council through Resolution #0179X-2023, passed on October 9, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance #0830-2024, passed March 25, 2024, amended Chapter 3310 and outlined the plan to create a new Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes for the new 2024 Zoning Code, and also codified the process to rezone parcels from Title 33 zoning districts to 2024 Zoning Code districts; and\n \nWHEREAS, On April 4, Mayor Ginther presented City Council with the Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors, outlining six new mixed-use zoning district designations along with maps and parcel lists depicting their proposed allocation; and\n \nWHEREAS, Resolution #0088X-2024 was adopted by Columbus City Council on April 8, 2024, accepting the proposal; declaring its intention to proceed with adoption of a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code and rezone certain properties from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to new Title 34 district designations; and launching a sixty-day public review and comment period; and\n \nWHEREAS, notice of proposed code and map updates was provided to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, interactive website information, and social media posts; and\n \nWHEREAS, the proposed code and map changes were available for review online and at an interactive Zone In Gallery, open throughout the comment period, which hosted over 1,500 property owners, residents, and stakeholder group members; and\n \nWHEREAS, over 1,800 comments were resubmitted regarding the proposal during the two-month public comment period; and\n \nWHEREAS, three public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7, 2024, June 6, 2024, and June 27, 2024, wherein the general public could provide further comment on the proposal; and\n \nWHEREAS, comments received during the review period contributed to development of an updated Phase One proposal, which is the subject of this ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, companion ordinances have been submitted to rezone 12,300± parcels to new 2024 Zoning Code district designations, and amend Titles 1 (Ordinance #2110-2024), 33 (Ordinance #2111-2024), and 43 (Ordinance #2115-2024) as necessary to support implementation of Title 34; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary and appropriate for the general welfare of the residents of the City of Columbus to enact a new Title 34, 2024 Zoning Code in order to provide a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development and growth; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
