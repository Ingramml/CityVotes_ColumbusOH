    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe Zone In Columbus Initiative is a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and Official Zoning Map aimed at providing a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development and growth. Zone In was launched in response to a number of problems identified in a 2021 assessment of the current zoning code.  In the Spring of 2023, the “Where Do We Begin” report identified that the initial phase of Zone In should focus on 140 miles of key corridors. These “Main Streets” were identified as having the greatest potential to deliver critically needed housing, support enhanced mobility options, and create employment opportunities in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable.  The report identified “Main Street” locations based on a number of factors including existing land use and development policy; current base zoning and overlays, existing conditions; proximity to current and planned public transportation, specifically COTA routes and proposed LinkUS bus rapid transit alignments; and site-specific circumstances.  \n \nThe City of Columbus’ Zone-In Team, consisting of subject matter experts in planning and zoning, including lead consultant, Lisa Wise Consulting Inc., began development of new pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use zoning districts in 2023. This process involved extensive technical analysis, policy review, and community engagement.  Outreach included community conversations, in-person presentations to area commissions and other community groups, social media and email distribution lists, webinars, and a project website.  The process also benefited from the active engagement of the Zone In Advisory Committee.  Comprised of a diverse membership with expertise in neighborhood, civic, development, and equity disparity issues, the committee’s guidance was particularly instrumental in the formulation of Phase One priorities, which were identified as focusing on housing, mobility, urban design, equity, and supporting local businesses. These priorities and overall project goals were endorsed by City Council on October 9, 2023 through passage of Resolution #0179X-2023. \n \nThe project priorities, and strategies to address them, were featured in a series of community workshops in the fall of 2023.  A mailing to 78,000 property owners and tenants within and adjacent to the identified focus area corridors, provided notice of the project.  A digital survey, launched in conjunction with the workshops, garnered 6,600 responses.  The feedback received from these and prior efforts contributed to the formulation of the Phase One proposal. \n \nOn March 25, 2024, in anticipation of the proposal, City Council approved Ordinance #0830-2024, amending Chapter 3310 and outlining the plan to create a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code of the Columbus City Codes.  The 2024 Zoning Code will work in conjunction with the existing Title 33 Zoning Code. Over time, all aspects of existing Title 33 will be revised or replaced as they are moved to Title 34. Changes to Chapter 3310 also laid out the process to rezone parcels with existing Title 33 zoning district designations to new 2024 Zoning Code districts.\n \nOn April 4, 2024, Mayor Ginther presented the “Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors” to City Council.  The submission included maps depicting the proposed rezoning of 12,300± parcels along key corridors to one of six new pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use zoning districts. The placement of parcels into each district was given careful consideration by the Zone In Team, drawing on public input and ongoing technical analysis. Allowable uses and other standards for the new districts were outlined in the companion proposed 2024 Zoning Code. Adoption of the new code is the subject of a companion ordinance.\n \nOn April 8, 2024, City Council approved Resolution #0088-2024, accepting the proposal and initiating a sixty-day public comment period.  Notice to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public was provided through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, and social media.  The proposed code and map were made available on the project website and as part of an interactive Zone In Gallery, allowing for area and code section specific input.  Open throughout the comment period, the Zone In Gallery hosted over 1,500 in-person visits from property owners, residents, stakeholder groups and others seeking to learn about the proposal and provide feedback.  Public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7 and June 6, 2024, allowing for further public input.\n \nOver 1,800 total comments were received during the review period. Over 1,200 of these comments were focused on the map, with the majority being supportive of the proposal. This input was summarized in a third public hearing, held on June 27, 2024. \n \nThis ordinance rezones 12,300± parcels into six new mixed-use zoning districts outlined in the updated code.  These Title 34 district designations include: Urban General (UGN-1 and UGN-2), Urban Center (UCT), Urban Core (UCR), including the Urban Core Restricted (UCR-R) Sub-District, Community Activity Center (CAC), and Regional Activity Center (RAC).  Specific parcel designations are illustrated by Exhibit A: Mixed Use Zoning Districts Map Series and Exhibit B: Mixed Use Zoning Districts Parcel Lists. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, existing base zoning will be replaced by these new districts.  Consequently, urban, community and regional commercial overlay designations in place for parcels being rezoned will be removed.  Parcels being rezoned that fall within the East Franklinton District (Chapter 3323) and University District Zoning Overlay (Chapter 3325) will continue to be subject to design review requirements as outlined in amended Title 33.  Design review provisions will also remain in place for rezoned parcels falling under the authority of historic and architectural review commissions established in Title 31.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo rezone specific properties within certain City of Columbus corridors to one of the following mixed use districts: UGN-1 and UGN-2, Urban General Districts, UCT, Urban Center District, UCR, Urban Core District, UCR-R, Urban Core Restricted Sub-District, CAC, Community Activity Center District, and RAC, Regional Activity Center District.\n \nBody \nWHEREAS, Columbus embarked on the Zone In initiative, a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and map, with the goal of creating a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development, and growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Zone In team conducted extensive analysis of existing conditions, development patterns, area and community plans, and citywide policy direction in formulating map and code recommendations for the first phase of this work; and \n \nWHEREAS, recommendations were further shaped by thousands of points of community engagement generated through presentations, mailings to property owners and tenants, area commission visits, workshops, emails, digital surveys, website resources, and social media; and\n \nWHEREAS, this work was further guided by goals and priorities, reflecting the active engagement of a Zoning Advisory Committee and approved by City Council through Resolution #0179X-2023, passed on October 9, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance #0830-2024, passed March 25, 2024, amended Chapter 3310 and outlined the plan to create a new Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes for the new 2024 Zoning Code, and also codified the process to rezone parcels from Title 33 zoning districts to 2024 Zoning Code districts; and\n \nWHEREAS, On April 4, Mayor Ginther presented City Council with the Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors, outlining six new mixed-use zoning district designations along with maps and parcel lists depicting their proposed allocation; and\n \nWHEREAS, Resolution #0088X-2024 was adopted by Columbus City Council on April 8, 2024, accepting the proposal, declaring its intention to proceed with adoption of a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code and rezone certain properties from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to new Title 34 district designations, and launching a sixty-day public review and comment period; and\n \nWHEREAS, notice of proposed map and code updates was provided to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, interactive website information, and social media posts; and\n \nWHEREAS, the proposed map changes and code were available for review at an interactive Zone In Gallery, open throughout the comment period, which hosted over 1,500 property owners, residents, and stakeholder group members; and\n \nWHEREAS, over 1,200 comments on the Phase One proposed map amendments were received during the two-month public comment period, the majority of which indicated support for the proposed district placement or preference for a more intense designation; and\n \nWHEREAS, three public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7, 2024, June 6, 2024, and June 27, 2024, wherein the general public could provide further comment on the proposal; and\n \nWHEREAS, companion ordinances have been submitted to enact a new 2024 Zoning Code (Ordinance #2112-2024), said code containing provisions for the mixed-use districts referenced in this ordinance, and to amend Title 33 (Ordinance #2111-2024) as needed to support implementation of the 2024 Zoning Code; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary and appropriate for the general welfare of the residents of the City of Columbus to proceed with the rezoning of 12,300± parcels from existing Title 33 zoning district designations to Title 34 2024 zoning district designations as the first phase of Zone In; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
