    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe Zone In Columbus Initiative is a multi-phase effort to update the City’s Zoning Code and Map in order to provide a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development and growth.  Zone In proposes that a new 2024 Zoning Code be established under Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes.  \n \nResolution #0179X-2023, approved by City Council on October 9, 2023, outlined goals and priorities for the first phase of this effort.  Prepared by a team of City staff and consultants, the “Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors” was presented to City Council for their consideration in early April.  The submission includes both code and map updates, proposing that certain parcels along 140 miles of the City’s major corridors be rezoned from existing Title 33 zoning districts to one of six new mixed-use 2024 Zoning Code district designations.  \n \nA key policy element of Zone In is the adoption of a market-based approach to parking. Many cities throughout the United States have taken steps to eliminate minimum parking requirements and adopt market-based parking strategies to promote economic development, support transit and walkability, and facilitate affordable housing, all of which are consistent with the goals of Zone In. Extensive analysis of the existing Title 33 Zoning Code, past amendments and requests for variances to the Code, and research of best practices as evidenced by project history in Columbus’ Downtown and the experiences of numerous peer cities, ultimately informed the recommendation to eliminate minimum vehicular parking requirements for the new 2024 Zoning Code mixed-use districts. Bicycle parking is still required for the new districts. \n \nOn April 8, 2024, City Council approved Resolution #0088-2024, accepting the Zone In Phase One proposal and initiating a sixty-day public comment period.  Notice to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public was provided through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, social media, and project website updates. An interactive Zone In Gallery was open to the community throughout the comment period, allowing for in-person visits to learn more and provide feedback.  Additionally, three public hearings were held by Columbus City Council on May 7, 2024; June 6, 2024; and June 27, 2024, wherein the general public could provide further comment on the proposal.  Over 1,800 comments were received during the sixty-day review period.  \n \nThe proposal to eliminate minimum vehicular parking requirements for the Zone In Phase One \ndistricts generated extensive public feedback through the aforementioned public comment period, and was discussed in detail at the June 6, 2024 public hearing. Public feedback has included a mixture of support for the market-based parking strategy and concern that new development may create spillover parking impacts on surrounding neighborhood streets. To address these concerns while supporting the broader goals of the Zone In effort, City Staff has developed a strategy to require a parking impact review for development within the new 2024 Zoning Districts. \n \nThis ordinance enacts changes to Title 43 Platting and Engineering Code, attached as “Exhibit A,” necessary to implement a Parking Impact Study requirement for new or expanded development, or changes of use, within the 2024 Zoning Districts. The Parking Impact Study Code authorizes the Public Service Director to promulgate rules and regulations for the administration of a Parking Impact Study. The Parking Impact Study Code also authorizes the requirement of a parking impact study for any request for a variance to minimum parking requirements in the Title 33 Zoning Code. Currently, the Department of Public Service (DPS) administers guidelines for parking studies to be conducted for parking variance requests. A preliminary draft of these rules and regulations has been prepared by DPS staff and is attached to this ordinance as \"Exhibit B.\" This review guide document will be finalized upon promulgation of the rules and regulations once this ordinance takes effect.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo supplement the Columbus City Codes by the enactment of a new Chapter 4310, entitled “Parking Impact Study Code.”\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus embarked on the Zone In initiative with the goal of creating a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development, and growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, Zone In calls for creation of a new 2024 Zoning Code within Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, the first phase of this multi-phase effort is entitled Zone In Phase One Proposal for Modernized Zoning on Columbus Corridors; and\n \nWHEREAS, this proposal includes a market-based parking strategy intended to address key Zone In priorities as expressed by City Council in Resolution #0179X-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, in response to input received during the Zone In Phase One public comment period, a Parking Impact Study program was developed to assess potential off-site parking impacts of new development and apply mitigation measures as appropriate; and \n \nWHEREAS, additional ordinances have been submitted enacting the updated Phase One proposal, including a new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code and series of zoning map amendments; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance would enact those changes to Title 43 necessary for the authorization of a Parking Impact Study requirement to support the implementation of the 2024 Zoning Code; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
