    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend Section 2133.07 of the Columbus City Codes, adding the prohibition of stunt driving and street takeovers to the section.\n \nDuring and following the COVID pandemic, there has been a surge of street racing, stunt driving, and street takeovers throughout the country, creating dangerous activity on public streets.  Columbus Police have responded with various initiatives, such as Operation Wheels Down, which increased enforcement and prosecution of those who recklessly drive ATVs or dirt bikes on city streets.  CPD has also responded to various large and high-profile incidents of this reckless exhibition, including a 2023 incident where participants opened fire on police officers.  Residents across the City have raised concerns about these activities, which worsen traffic safety and endanger lives.  \n \nAlong with municipalities, state legislatures have created new provisions and penalties for this activity, including Florida, Washington, Tennessee, and Texas.  The Ohio Legislature recently passed House Bill 56, which addresses this issue in the Ohio Revised Code.  The City is now proposing to adopt similar prohibitions on this activity in the Columbus City Codes, amending the section on street racing to include stunt driving and street takeovers.  The amendment includes the following:\n                     \n•                     Prohibits any person from knowingly participating in stunt driving (i.e., burnouts, doughnuts, drifting wheelies, or allowing passengers to ride partially or fully outside the vehicle) on any public road, street, or highway, or private property open to the public.\n•                     Prohibits a person from knowingly participating in a street takeover (i.e., blocking or impeding the regular flow of vehicle or pedestrian traffic for the purpose of street racing or stunt driving) on any public road, street, highway, or private property that is open to the public.\n•                     Specifies that anyone rendering assistance to stunt driving or street takeover must be charged the same as the participants.\n•                     Prohibits street racing on private property open to the public and applies the current law penalties for street racing on public roads, streets, and highways to the offense.\n                     Exempts competitive operation of vehicles on public or private property from the above prohibitions in accordance with a Special Event permit issued pursuant to Chapter 923 or when otherwise authorized by ordinance of Council.\n•                     Makes the two new criminal offenses a first degree misdemeanor, with a possible driver’s license suspension of 30 days to three years, and assessment of six points on the offender’s license.\n•                     Defines a “Vehicle Component” as: “any motor vehicle part or accessory specifically adapted for use in street racing, stunt driving, or street takeover.  Vehicle Component includes, but is not limited to, steering wheels, wheels and tires, and mufflers.”\n•                     Authorizes forfeiture of Vehicle Components used in the commission of an offense\n \nThis ordinance will serve to address these dangerous activities more specifically in the Codes, and promote the safety of all residents in Columbus.   \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend section 2133.07 of the Columbus City Codes, establishing the prohibition of stunt driving and street takeovers and penalties for violations; and to repeal existing section 2133.07 of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Chapter 2133 of the Columbus City Codes pertains to provisions regarding the reckless operation of vehicles; and \n \nWHEREAS, Section 2133.07 deals specifically with street racing prohibitions; and \n \nWHEREAS, since the COVID pandemic, there has been a surge of street racing, stunt driving, and street takeovers throughout the country, creating dangerous activity on public streets;
