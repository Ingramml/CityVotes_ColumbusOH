    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with Strawser Paving Company for the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 1 project and to provide payment for construction, construction administration and inspection services.  \n \nThis contract involves repairing and resurfacing 84 city streets and constructs 433 ADA curb ramps along those streets.  The work consists of milling the existing pavement, overlaying with new asphalt concrete, minor curb replacement, and replacing curb and sidewalk associated with installing ADA wheelchair ramps.  Where warranted, the plans also call for areas of full depth pavement repair, and other work as may be necessary to complete the contract in accordance with the plans and specifications set forth in the Bid Submittal Documents.\n \nThe estimated Notice to Proceed date is June 15, 2021.  The project was let by the Office of Support Services through Vendor Services and Bid Express.  Three bids were received on April 8, 2021, and tabulated as follows:   \n      \nCompany Name                                                    Bid Amount               City/State                Majority/MBE/FBE     \nStrawser Paving Company                                           $ 9,739,943.29            Columbus, OH                                           Majority\nShelly & Sands, Inc.                                                $10,490,826.98           Columbus, OH                                           Majority\nKokosing Construction Company                             $10,960,899.58           Westerville, OH                                Majority \n \nAward is to be made to Strawser Paving Company as the lowest responsive and responsible and best bidder for their bid of $9,739,943.29.  The amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $876,594.90.  The total legislated amount is $10,616,538.19.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Strawser Paving Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Strawser Paving Company is CC006114 and expires 01/14/2023.\n \n3.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nStrawser Paving Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nBudget authority and cash for the Resurfacing work is expected to be in the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget under Resurfacing (P530282-100051).  The funds will not be available to Public Service until the proceeds of the 2021 bond sale are available later this calendar year.  Therefore, it is necessary to certify funds in the amount of $10,589,070.19 against the Special Income Tax Fund, Fund 4430.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget is required to match cash received from the Special Income Tax Fund and also to establish sufficient budget authority for this project.  Funds will need to be appropriated within the Special Income Tax fund and then transferred to the Streets and Highways Bond Fund where they will also need to be appropriated.  \n \nThe remaining funding, in the amount of $27,468.00, is available from the Department of Public Utilities Storm Sewer Bond fund.  The funds are appropriated.\n    \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to complete the needed improvements at the earliest possible time to ensure the safety of the travelling public.\nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget;
