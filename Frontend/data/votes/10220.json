    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council previously passed ordinance 0977-2017 to amend the Columbus City Codes in consideration of the environmental benefits of milkweed. That ordinance removed milkweed from the definition of \"weeds\" in the health, sanitation, and safety code. However, it appears that a drafting error occurred that preserved milkweed in the definition of weeds under the housing code. This ordinance removes milkweed from the definition of weeds under the housing code to conform with the intent of 0977-2017, and to prevent residents from being cited for growing milkweed.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: N/A\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend section 4501.45 of the Columbus City Codes to remove milkweed from the definition of \"weeds\" in the housing code.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council previously passed ordinance 0977-2017 to amend the Columbus City Codes in consideration of the environmental benefits of milkweed; and\n \nWHEREAS, Milkweed is native to central Ohio and serves an indispensable role as a host for monarch butterflies, among other environmental benefits; and\n \nWHEREAS, Milkweed is currently defined in the Columbus City Codes as a weed subject to remediation under the housing code; and\n \nWHEREAS, It is the intent of Columbus City Council to encourage residents to consider adding native plants like milkweed to their gardens and landscaping; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That City Code Section 4501.45 be amended as follows:\n \n4501.45 - Weeds.\n \n\"Weeds\" shall mean those plant species including but not limited to, brush, vines or shrubs as listed in Chapter 901:5-37-01 of the Ohio Administrative Code, titled \"Noxious Weeds,\" and Chapter 901:5-37 of the Ohio Administrative Code, titled \"Other Prohibited Noxious Weeds,\" and thistles, burdock, jimson weed, ragweed, milkweed, mullein, poison ivy, poison oak, grass or other plant species of rank growth which may potentially create, directly or indirectly, an unhealthy or unsafe condition.\n \nSECTION 2. That the previous version of section 4501.45 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
