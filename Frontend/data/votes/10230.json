    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize and Celebrate the 21st Anniversary of the National African American Male Wellness Agency\nBody\nWHEREAS, founded in 2004, the National African American Male Wellness Agency (NAAMWA) was created to begin the process of making men understand that through prevention, one can live longer; and \n \nWHEREAS, for the past twenty years John and Pamela Gregory have championed to close the inequitable gap between the life expectancies of Caucasian and African American men, as African American men are more likely to die from chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and their life expectancy on average is lower than Caucasian men; and \n \nWHEREAS, through charitable initiatives including providing thousands of free health screenings yearly and organizing the National Black Male Wellness Walk, the National African American Male Wellness Agency has given African American men new insight on their health and raised awareness of racial health disparities in the United States; and\n \nWHEREAS, the National African American Male Wellness Agency, recognizing that wellness is a holistic issue, has embraced an expanded perspective on health and wellness to include fatherhood, financial wellness, mental health, mentorship, and research initiatives; and \n \nWHEREAS, the National African American Male Wellness Agency is celebrating twenty years of positive change in the lives and well-being of African American men across the country as the agency continues to engage with men in over eighteen different U.S. cities, including Washington D.C., Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC, Los Angeles, CA, and Columbus, OH; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate the 21st Anniversary of the National African American Male Wellness Agency.",
