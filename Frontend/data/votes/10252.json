    "description": "Explanation\nOrdinance 1306-2024 was approved by City Council on June 10 as a 30-day ordinance.   Due to a delay in the drafting, language edits, and approval of this ordinance, and because an emergency designation was not requested, the effective date of the ordinance and corresponding contract with FACCES was not until mid-July - well past when the work began.  At the advice of the City Attorney's Office, the Mayor's Office of Education is requesting the authority to retroactively pay FACCES for this work.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Office of Education to enter into a retroactive grant agreement with the Family Adolescent & Child Community Engagement Services (FACCES), a non-profit entity, to reimburse them for their engagement in the 2024 summer youth education program. FACCES is a non-profit organization whose mission is to place unique and pointed emphasis on each member of the community, with a priority on being child centered.  FACCES strives to be a hub for families to connect with resources that support them in leading healthy lives.\n \nFACCES will only be reimbursed for program expenses incurred during the program period of May 1 to September 30, 2024.\n \nFACCES was selected to perform this work via a competitive summer programming process overseen by various City departments and City Council.  Neither the Office of Education nor any other City staff have either the experience or skills needed to perform this program.\n \nFiscal Impact: There is no funding associated with this ordinance.  Ordinance 1306-2024 appropriated funding for this program.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \nAs the work is already completed, an emergency designation is requested to reimburse FACCES for their work as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a retroactive grant agreement with the Family Adolescent & Child Community Engagement Services (FACCES) for their engagement in the 2024 summer youth education program; to authorize reimbursement only for expenses incurred prior to the issuance of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1306-2024, passed by Council on June 10, authorized the Office of Education to enter into an agreement with FACCES to provide summer youth programming and provided an expenditure of $170,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, due to a delay in the approval of the ordinance, and because an emergency designation was not requested, the effective date of the ordinance and corresponding contract with FACCES was not until mid-July - well past when the work began; and  \n \nWHEREAS; due to these factors, the Columbus City Attorney's Office advised the Mayor's Office of Education to request the authority to retroactively pay FACCES for this work; and\n \nWHEREAS, Family Adolescent & Child Community Engagement Services is a non-profit organization whose mission is to place unique and pointed emphasis on each member of the community, with a priority on being child centered; and\n \nWHEREAS, Family Adolescent & Child Community Engagement Services summer youth education program provided programing to youth during the 2024 summer months to help them recognize, develop and enhance their skills to navigate, persevere, and overcome the inherent challenges and risky behaviors that poverty exacerbates; and\n \nWHEREAS, FACCES was selected to perform this work via a competitive summer programing process overseen by various City departments and City Council; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a retroactive grant agreement with FACCES to allow for immediate reimbursement as the work was completed from May 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Office of Education is authorized to enter into a retroactive grant agreement in the amount of $170,000.00, already allocated by Ordinance 1306-2024, with the not-for-profit Family Adolescent & Child Community Engagement Services; expressly authorizing reimbursement for expenses incurred prior to the issuance of the purchase order.\n \nSECTION 2. That FACCES was selected to perform this work via a competitive summer programing process overseen by various City departments and City Council. \n \nSECTION 3. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or 10 days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same",
