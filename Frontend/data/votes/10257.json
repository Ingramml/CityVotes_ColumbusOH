    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Central Ohio Trauma Systems (COTS) with funds originating from the Department of Health and Human Services for the COTS Coalition grant program. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $8,000.00 in grant money for the period July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.\n \nThe Regional Healthcare Emergency Preparedness County-Level Healthcare Coalition (RHCC) is a local group of healthcare agencies (hospitals, Emergency Management Agencies, public health authorities, EMS, long term care facilities, nursing homes, American Red Cross, hospice providers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, urgent care centers, home health providers, and other healthcare partners in the community) formed to meet federal grant requirements. Columbus Public Health has agreed to lead this coalition. The RHCC members may assume other roles and responsibilities during emergencies that impact the healthcare system in our county, region, or state. Members will communicate, maintain situational awareness, and share resources with each other, other coalitions in the central Ohio region, and healthcare partners in other regions. The RHCC meets twice per year.\n \nThis grant provides funds to continue the coordination of a county-level coalition in Franklin County. \n \nThere is an immediate need to accept and appropriate these grant funds to avoid forfeiture of the grant, to convene the Regional Healthcare Coalition to participate in county-level disaster preparedness plans required by federal programs including the National Incident Management Systems, Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program, and National Preparedness Goals. These plans protect the public safety by having up-to-date protocols for emergency management and response. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is funded by the Central Ohio Trauma System and does not generate revenue or require a city match. ($8,000.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from Central Ohio Trauma System to continue the coordination of a county-level coalition for Franklin County in the amount of $8,000.00; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $8,000.00 in the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($8,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, grant funds have been awarded to Columbus Public Health from Central Ohio Trauma Systems (COTS) with funds originating from the Department of Health and Human Services for the COTS Coalition grant program for the period of July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the acceptance and appropriation of the funds for the support of the COTS Coalition grant program; and, \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the COTS grant program as needed upon request by the Columbus Public Health Department; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these funds related to disaster preparedness which protect the safety, health and wellness of the residents of Central Ohio, and to avoid forfeiture of the grant, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $8,000.00 from Central Ohio Trauma System (COTS) for the COTS Coalition grant program for the period of July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department's Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources during the grant period, the sum of $8,000.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated to the Health Department, Division No. 5001, upon receipt of an executed grant agreement. \n \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except upon voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused city match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 6.                     That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer appropriations between object classes for the COTS grant program as needed upon request by the Columbus Public Health Department.\n \nSECTION 7.
