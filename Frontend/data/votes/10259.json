($100,000.00).",
    "description": "Explanation                     \n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify three existing contracts for language services at Columbus Public Health in an amount not to exceed $100,000.00 for the following vendors to provide language services, which includes document translation, in-person interpretation, telephone interpretation, and video interpretation. These services will be provided at Columbus Public Health, located at 240 Parsons Avenue, and/or within the communities served by Columbus Public Health staff. The three contracts to be modified are as follows:\n \nAccess 2 Interpreters LLC - CC010229: $200,000.00\nEffectiff LLC - CC041262: $80,000.00\nSign Language USA Inc - CC02467: $88,000.00\nTOTAL CONTRACTS: $368,000.00\n \nThe contracts were authorized by Ordinance 0282-2024. The contract period for each contract is from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025. \n \nCost for interpretation and translations have increased as a direct result of the volume of customer requests. Additionally, there has been a substantial increase in languages with higher interpretation costs. This is supported by immigration trends and the increase in the number of language service appointments. Although the original amounted funded was limited by budgetary constraints, an unforeseen year-over-year increase in customer requests and significant increase in languages with higher interpretation costs over the first three months of the contract term has necessitated additional funding.\n \nIn order to maximize use of funds and avoid termination of services for our clientele, CPH is requesting flexibility in the amount to modify each of the three language contracts. Therefore, this ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify the three aforementioned contracts and freely allocate the $100,000.00 requested funds amongst the contracts based on projected use and without the need for additional legislation.  \n \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires recipients of Federal financial assistance to take reasonable steps to make their programs, services, and activities accessible by eligible persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). As our LEP clients increase we must increase our resources to properly serve them. \n \nIt would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes as specified in Columbus City Code 329 because these are ongoing services, a break of which would be detrimental to the wellbeing of our clients, and the underlying contract was previously awarded via RFP. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure that there is not a gap in these essential services. Recent, unforeseen events have led to an increased need for language services through the end of the contract term and additional funds are required to pay for those services. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT Expenditures to provide these services are budgeted in the 2024 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250. ($100,000.00) \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify three existing contracts for language services with Access 2 Interpreters, LLC; Effectiff LLC; and Sign Language USA LLC; to authorize the expenditures to cover these modifications from the 2024 Health Special Revenue Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to modify existing contracts for language services with Access 2 Interpreters LLC, Effectiff LLC, and Sign Language USA LLC and to freely allocate the requested funds amongst the contracts based on projected use and without the need for additional legislation. The respective dollar amounts for each contract is to be determined at a later date and not to exceed total funds authorized by this ordinance. Total amount needed to increase these contracts shall not exceed $100,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, Access 2 Interpreters, LLC; Effectiff LLC; and Sign Language USA LLC have the expertise required to carry out those services; and \n \nWHEREAS, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires recipients of Federal financial assistance to take reasonable steps to make their programs, services, and activities accessible by eligible persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP); and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual, daily operations of the Department of Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board to modify these contracts for language services ensure that there is not a gap in these essential services. Recent, unforeseen events have led to an increased need for language services at CPH and additional funds are required to pay for those services and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify existing contracts for language services with Access 2 Interpreters LLC, Effectiff LLC, and Sign Language USA LLC and to freely allocate the requested funds amongst the contracts based on projected use and without the need for additional legislation. The respective dollar amounts for each contract is to be determined at a later date and not to exceed total funds authorized by this ordinance. The total amount needed to increase all three contracts shall not exceed $100,000.00. \n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $100,000.00 is hereby authorized from the 2024 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250, Department of Health, Division No. 5001, in object class 03 - Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That these contract modifications are in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these contract modifications are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the city's financial records.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
