The contract period for this contract modification is January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 with an an amount not to exceed $18,000.00, for a new total contract amount of $38,000.00.\n \nAdvantage Imaging LLC's contract compliance number is CC-001522. \n \nColumbus Public Health (CPH) has a need to increase 340B Radiology X-Ray (Adult) Services for the Ben Franklin Tuberculosis (TB) grant program with Advantage Imaging LLC which are required to treat virtually all patients with TB disease. Additionally, an increase in TB patients without insurance who are also Medicaid ineligible also contributed to increased costs.  \n \nThe contract increase amount is based on the previous six months of purchased services which represent the current patient cases being treated. CPH is requesting that the competitive bidding provisions outlined in Chapter 329.18 of the Columbus City Code be waived for this contract.  \n \nThere is an immediate need to continue radiology services with Advantage Imaging, LLC. A disruption to those services could be harmful to current TB patients according to medical treatment standards which would significantly increase the risk of TB transmission in Franklin County. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $18,000.00 is budgeted in the Health Department Grant Fund for radiology services for the TB grant program.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Advantage Imaging, for increased Radiology X-Ray (Adult) Services for the Ben Franklin TB grant program for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $18,000.00 from the Health Department Grant fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($18,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health has a need to modify an existing contract for Radiology X-Ray (Adult) Services for the contract period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024; and \n \nWHEREAS, Advantage Imaging has the expertise required to provide these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the Columbus Public Health Department to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board to modify a contract with Advantage Imaging LLC to ensure the continued radiology services to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in Franklin County, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify the existing contract with Advantage Imaging LLC in the amount not to exceed $18,000.00, for a new total contract amount of $38,000, for the TB grant program, for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. \n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the costs of said contract, an expenditure not to exceed $18,000.00 is authorized from the Health Department Grant fund, Fund No. 2251, per the attached accounting document. \n \nSECTION 4.  That the provisions of Sections 329.18 of the Columbus City Code are hereby waived. \n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this Ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
