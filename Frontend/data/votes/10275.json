    "description": "...Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health (CPH) has been awarded grant funding for the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio grant program, from pass through agency, The Ohio Department of Health via Ordinance 2154-2024. This ordinance is needed to authorize four (4) subrecipient agreements under the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio grant program. All contract terms included in this ordinance are from August 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025, with the following qualified vendors: Aid’s Healthcare Foundation, Equitas Health, Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc., dba Primary One Health and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio. \n \nThe vendors included in this ordinance are not for profit agencies and are exempt from bidding according to bidding requirements of the City Code 329.30. The EHE services incorporated in the subrecipient agreements include, but not limited to, housing services, emergency financial assistance, and client transportation, resource navigation, client transportation, and Counseling, Testing & Referral services. Contract price points are based on agency staffing projections and individual client counts for services based on enrolled clients in the program, and other estimated direct costs ancillary to EHE program initiatives. \n \nUnder the terms of the grant, this grant period is ten months grant cycle, and funds must be used during the grant period or they are forfeited. Previously, CPH has reallocated unused funds from vendors through appropriate contract modifications. These modifications oftentimes required additional legislation. The listed vendors operate based on program staffing, varying client counts, and thus often leaving unspent funds. The Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio grant program is an ancillary grant with four specific pillars: Diagnose, Prevent, Treat, and Respond, to the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program federally funded with HRSA. These pillars, specifically the prevention pillar can supplement HIV services for individuals within the priority population and allow needed services to be delivered to individuals at an elevated risk of acquiring HIV. As a result, this ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with qualified vendors, modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused and reallocate unused funds amongst the initial vendors without the need for additional legislation. As such, this ordinance requests a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329, as well as the contract modification procedures of Chapter 329. \n \n \nAIDS Healthcare Foundation (EBO_CC-CC-010938): $56,942.00\nEquitas Health (EBO_CC-CC043135): $218,575.00\nColumbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc., dba Primary One Health (EBO_CC-CC-005542): $123,000.00\nLutheran Social Services of Central Ohio (CC-006115): $244,166.00\nTotal Amount: $642,683.00\n \nEmergency action is required to ensure the continued operation of Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio grant program from the Ohio Department of Health and to meet grant deliverables required by the grantor to avoid forfeiture of future funds.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance will authorize one ACPO in the amount of $642,683.00 to encumber funds using available grant appropriations for contracts with vendors. These subrecipient agreements are funded entirely by a grant award from the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio grant program. This grant does not generate revenue nor require a city match. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into subrecipient agreements with (4) qualified vendors: AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Equitas Health, Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc., dba Primary One Health and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio for EHE services for the period August 1, 2024 through May 31, 2025; to authorize the Board of Health to modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds amongst the initial vendors without the need for additional legislation for Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio grant program for the provision of services allowable under the grant; to authorize the expenditure of $642,683.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; to waive competitive bidding; and to declare an emergency.
