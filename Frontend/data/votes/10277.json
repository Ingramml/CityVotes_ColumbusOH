    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:                     \nThis ordinance is submitted to settle the pending lawsuit known as FOP Capital City Lodge No. 9, et al., v. City of Columbus, United States District Court Case No. 22-CV-4290 involving Plaintiffs Bryan Hupp and Steven Steenburgh; and to avoid additional litigation by settling the related claims of Larry Howell and Mike Evans in the amount of three-hundred sixty thousand dollars and zero cents ($360,000.00). All claims arise out of the determination that Hupp, Steenburgh, Howell and Evans (together “Members,” with  Members and the City collectively  referred to as the “Parties”) were deemed not eligible to participate in the Retirement Incentive Program (“Program”) in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed to by the City of Columbus and the Fraternal Order of Police.\n \nOn July 15, 2021, the City of Columbus and the FOP executed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) setting forth the material terms of the Program as mutually agreed upon by the City of Columbus and the FOP. The Final Program Terms stipulated that the election period to opt into and participate in the Program was from January 31, 2022 to February 6, 2022 and that in order to be eligible to participate, a member could not be under administrative investigation, other than for minor misconduct, or under criminal investigation at any time from January 31, 2022 through the date of the member’s retirement under the Program. \n \nOn March 28, 2022, Hupp, Steenburgh, Howell and Evans were determined to be under administrative investigation and deemed ineligible to participate in the Program. As a result, Hupp and Steenburgh filed the lawsuit known as FOP Capital City Lodge No. 9, et al., v. City of Columbus, United States District Court Case No. 22-CV-4290 for breach of contract, alleging the City breached the terms of the Program when it determined that Hupp and Steenburgh were not eligible to participate in the Program. The Parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The Court denied the motions and concluded there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the City breached the Program terms. While the Parties prepared for mediation, the FOP notified the City that Howell and Evans were also planning to file lawsuits for being denied participation in the Program.  \n \nTo resolve all related claims arising out of the Members ineligibility to participate in the Program, the Parties agreed to settle all claims filed by Hupp in the amount of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000); all claims filed by Steenburgh in the amount of one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000); all potential claims by Evans in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and all potential claims by Howell in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).\n \nFiscal Impact:\nFunds were not specifically budgeted for this settlement; however, sufficient monies are available within the Department of Finance’s Citywide Account for this purpose. \n \nEmergency Designation:\n \nEmergency action is requested for this ordinance to be effective immediately in order for the Parties to effectuate the settlement of the lawsuit and the related claims in accordance with the terms of the settlements and to meet case deadlines, in the sum of three-hundred sixty thousand dollars and zero cents ($360,000.00), which is in the best interest of the City, and to pay the agreed sum without delay. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Attorney to settle the pending lawsuit known as FOP Capital City Lodge No. 9, et al., v.
