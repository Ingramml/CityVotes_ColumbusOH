    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize September as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month in the City of Columbus\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder in which red blood cells may become sickle-shaped and harden. The severity of SCD varies, with many people facing a shortened life expectancy and a host of recurring, debilitating, and expensive health problems. There is no universal cure for this condition, also SCD disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans; and\n \nWHEREAS, SCD affects our population unevenly. Black and Brown Americans are disproportionately affected. About 1 in 13 Black children tests positive for the sickle cell trait, and about 1 in 365 Black Americans develops the disease over the course of their lifetime.  Due to persistent systemic inequities in our health care system, these same patients are also often the last to get help; and \n \nWHEREAS, information about detecting this disease is not always widely shared, and pain management can be a challenge due to the intermittent nature of sickle cell crises and persistent racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment; and\n \nWHEREAS, this year’s theme is “stronger together”, a call to action for all of us to lean in, offer strength to those fighting, and to unite in our mission to enhance the quality of life for those diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease; and\n \nWHEREAS, this year’s resolution recipient, Annie J. Ross-Womack, is the Executive Director of the Ohio Sickle Cell and Health Association (OSCHA), and has been an invaluable, partner, advocate, and champion for the Sickle Cell community; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council proclaims, recognizes, and celebrates September as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month in Columbus the City of Columbus",
