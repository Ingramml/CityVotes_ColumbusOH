    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Legat Architects for the Aquatics Capital Improvements Program 2020 - Phase 1 Project. The contract amount is $286,560.00, with a contingency of $20,000.00, for a total of $306,560.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nLearning how to swim and safely enjoy the water is a life-long skill and this recreational activity is a core priority of Recreation and Parks. In 2019, the Department completed a system-wide strategic plan to analyze the state of recreational facilities, programs, inclusivity, and access for residents to parks, trails, sports, and pools.  A key finding of the plan was that the city’s aquatics program, serving thousands of youth and adults city-wide, was in substantial need of an updated capital improvement implementation program to determine how to handle the system’s aging pools, increased demand, and rapidly growing population. \n \nThis contract will provide preliminary engineering services for the Recreation and Parks Department’s Aquatics Capital Improvement Program, including capital planning and community engagement services. This project will conduct a comprehensive analysis of all of the Department’s 14 pools and spray grounds, as well as the indoor Columbus Aquatic Center.  A preliminary inventory shows that Columbus lags far behind cities of similar size with available pool space, access, financial sustainability, location, along with substantial maintenance costs due to aging facilities well beyond their service life.  The project will involve a full assessment of all the city’s aquatic facilities, including operating costs, programming constraints, and population served. The project will also examine the exterior and interior conditions of the facilities, including mechanical, electrical, and ADA Compliance. The project will include robust public engagement with key stakeholders and neighborhoods to help reach consensus on what trends, needs, and goals for success can be achieved in the next 10 years.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 18, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 10, 2020. Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nLegat Architects, Inc. (MAJ)\nWilliams Architects (MAJ)\nDesigning Local (MAJ)                                                                                                                               \nMSA Design (MAJ)                                                                                                                                                    \nBrandstetter Carol, Inc. (MAJ)                                          \nDavid Wince, Ltd. (MAJ)\nAbbot Studios (MAJ)\nMoody Nolan (MBE)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended that Legat Architects be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nLegat Architects, Inc.\n22 East Gay Street, Suite 500, Columbus, Ohio  43215                                                     \nCarli Sekalla 614-228-7758                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 026669, 36-3003268\nNovember 30, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the contractor can begin work as soon as possible to allow a related project, the design of Glenwood and Winsor Pool Improvements, to move forward. The public outreach and community input portion of these projects is included in the scope of this Capital Improvement Program and emergency action will allow for the design of these facilities to start, minimizing the impacts of the resulting construction to the 2022 swimming season at these two locations.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The preliminary engineering involved with this project will provide recommendations for future aquatics expansion throughout Columbus. The community has expressed strong desire for additional aquatic facilities for recreation, especially for relief during the heat of the summer and indoor opportunities during the cold weather months. Teaching the fundamentals of swimming and providing locations to practice these skills is a benefit to the safety of all who participate as well. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Windsor and Glenwood Pools are two aging inner city pools that are in need of significant improvements. The popular Aquatic Center was built in the 1960’s and is well over capacity to provide safe, inclusive, and quality pool programming.  In 2019, there were 175,000 attendees to the indoor Aquatics Center and 174,000 for the outdoor pools.  These numbers can be greatly increased with updates to the current facilities and expanding aquatics into additional neighborhoods in Columbus. As part of this work, communities, residents, and organizations will be engaged to help determine programming needs, revenue generating needs, and the needs of the immediate area impacted by this Project.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by upgrading community parks. Improving infrastructure, such as aquatics facilities, help make these parks safer, accessible, and user friendly. The overall assessment of the productivity of our aquatics amenities will help guide improvements, continuing to improve the system as a whole. \n \nFiscal Impact: $306,560.00 is budgeted and available from and within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Legat Architects for the Aquatics Capital Improvements Program 2020 - Phase 1 Project; to authorize the transfer of $306,560.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the expenditure of $306,560.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
