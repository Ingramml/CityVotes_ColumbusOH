    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: The City of Columbus owns large tracts of land in Franklin, Pickaway, and Delaware Counties held for future expansion of Department of Public Utilities Division of Water and Division of Sewerage and Drainage treatment facilities and for protection and buffering of groundwater well fields. The Department of Finance and Management, Real Estate Management Office (REMO) is responsible for the leasing of these City-owned tracts for farming purposes on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities. Leasing tillable land tracts for farming purposes benefits the City by: i) reducing costs for property management and oversight for mowing of fields, maintaining fences & tree lines, etc., ii) providing good stewardship of the land by keeping it in productive use to prevent vandalism and formation of wetland conditions, and iii) generating a small amount of income for the Division of Water and Division of Sewerage and Drainage.  \n \nCurrently the City leases tillable tracts of property to eight (8) farming entities.  The lease agreements with these entities will expire on November 30, 2024 and have no remaining renewal options. After an extensive review of the farming operations and stewardship practices of the current Tenants regarding their support of the City’s goals for land stewardship, it has been determined that it is the best interest of the City to extend the current leases with these Tenants to ensure consistent, professional management of the City’s tillable acreage and to preserve and manage the land in conformance with best farming practices. Consequently, an amendment of the existing leases is necessary to add an additional a five-year renewal term, establish the rental rate for the renewal term, and to make other necessary modifications.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute eight (8) lease amendments for the farming of available tillable acreage at various properties used in Department of Public Utilities operations in order to add a five-year renewal term, establish the rental rate for the renewal term, and make other necessary modifications. \n \nFiscal Impact: The rental revenue received by the City of Columbus for one lease at the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant will be deposited into the Sewer Operating-Sanitary Fund 6100 and the rental revenue from the remaining seven leases associated with Division of Water operations will be deposited into Water Operating Fund 6000.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into lease agreements or amendments, as applicable, with the following eight (8) entities or individuals for use of certain tracts of City-owned land for farming purposes: Radcliff Ventures, LLC; Adam Writsel; Richard Hempy; Timothy A. Barnes; Stephanie Lynn Taylor; D & D Peters LLC and Adam E. Peters; Mark Ruff; and Clifton Brothers, Inc.
