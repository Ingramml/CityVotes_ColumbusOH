    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Berglund Construction Company, via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) Raw Sewage Pump Building Rehab project, CIP #650260-103014, in an amount up to $975,000.00; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00. (for a total expenditure of $977,000.00).\n \nThe original Raw Sewage Pump Building (PMP) is in a state of disrepair due to long-term sewer gas exposure. This exposure led to failing brick façade, rusted lintels, and compromised doors and windows. These issues have not only weakened the building's structure, but has also allowed birds to infiltrate and nest causing health hazards from accumulated animal waste.\n \nThe Raw Sewage Pump Building Rehabilitation project will focus on architectural, structural, and electrical improvements. It will involve replacing the deteriorated brick façade, installing new storefront windows and doors, and conducting electrical upgrades to improve the building's lighting. The project also includes a thorough cleaning to remove any animal waste and nesting, ensuring the building is safe and sanitary for its future conversion into a functional space.\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 64, Far South.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 290 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $975,000.00, including a 20% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                        $ 975,000.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                           $           0.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                           $     2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                               $  977,000.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis construction contract will continue the City’s efforts to revitalize and improve existing infrastructure so that it can be repurposed and continue to be beneficially used for the operations of SWWTP.\n \nNo community outreach impact is considered for this project. Public informational meetings were not required because all proposed work is within the boundaries of the wastewater treatment plant. Regulatory agencies have been notified of the proposed work as appropriate.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the SWWTP Raw Sewage Pump Building Rehab project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 07/01/24 through 07/24/24.  Three bids were received for the project and were opened on 07/24/24.  The following companies submitted bids:\n  \nCompany                                                          Bid Amount                Compliance Number           ODI Status \n1.
