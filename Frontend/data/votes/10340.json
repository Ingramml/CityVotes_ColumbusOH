In order to comply with the requirement of installing required backflow prevention, Distribution Land Company LLC seeks to take ownership of an existing City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities waterline for the purpose of establishing water service line with a single meter for the property. \n \nA 16 (sixteen) inch diameter public water main owned by the City of Columbus, DOW located on private property, parcel number 520-150031. Distribution Land Company LLC has a private water tap and meter located at the south end of this water main. The water main runs north to south with the dead end occurring at the southern end of the main. Distribution Land Company LLC plans to install a new 12 (twelve) inch private water tap and meter north of their existing meter. After the meter, the private service will connect back into the existing 16 (sixteen) inch water main.  Since it is a dead end water main, this will convert the public main into a private water service south of the proposed connection. Therefore, once the work is completed, the ownership of the water main will need transferred from the City of Columbus, DOW to Distribution Land Company LLC. \n \nA proposed Waterline Ownership Transfer Agreement between the City of Columbus, DOW and Distribution Land Company LLC has been written and the parties are expected to sign, outlining responsibilities of each party.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: The Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water respectfully requests this legislation be considered as an emergency in order to expedite Distribution Land Company LLC’s ability to take ownership of the existing City of Columbus, DOW owned waterline.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: ($0.00) no funds are required.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those documents necessary to transfer ownership of an existing City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities waterline to Distribution Land Company LLC; to authorize the waiver of the  requirements of City Code for the sale of City-owned personal property; and to declare an emergency.
