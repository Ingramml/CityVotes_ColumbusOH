    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT) to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract/Purchase agreement (PA005605) to continue to acquire and implement a new Cisco Meraki boundary network and Cisco VOIP phone hardware.\n \nThrough utilization of the Best Value Procurement (BVP) process, proposals were solicited for the above-named projects via RFQ020154 in 2021. Submissions were received from two offerors: CDW Government (CDWG) and CBTS. The passed ordinance 3266-2021, was awarded to CDWG as a universal term contract/purchase agreement (UTC/PA) by the Purchasing Office of the Finance and Management.\n \nDoT will procure hardware, licenses, and maintenance and support (for the first 5 years); training, and professional services (for project management) against the above-noted companion ordinance; the installation, configuration, and implementation of a Cisco Meraki boundary network; and the migration of NEC phone systems to a Cisco VOIP phone system at various priority locations. These locations include, but are not limited to 111 N. Front Street, DPU Admin building, Rec and Park Centers, police substations, fire stations, and many other locations across the City of Columbus.\n \nThe replacement of this existing legacy infrastructure will improve both the boundary network and VOIP phone performance, capacity, security, and ensure that the City continues to keep its boundary network and VOIP phone infrastructure modern and supported.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes amending the 2024 capital improvement budget with the transfer of cash and authority between projects. This is necessary to ensure that there is adequate funding in the proper project.\nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $2,215,169.00 for the above-described project.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for the above-described project is available in Fund 5105, Information Services Capital Projects. This ordinance authorizes the transfer of budget authority and cash within the current CIB to the appropriate project. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nLLC CC#:  CC007352                                                                                                         Expiration Date: March 12, 2026\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract/Purchase agreement for network upgrades; to amend the 2024 capital improvement budget; to authorize the transfer of $778,070.81 between projects within the Information Services Capital fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $2,215,169.00.
