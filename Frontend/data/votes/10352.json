    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the Master Services Agreement with American Municipal Power, Inc. (AMP) to provide funding for participation in journeyman lineworker safety and training programs. \n \nLineworkers construct and maintain electric poles, transformers, and lines. The Division of Power (DOP) has an active journeyman lineworker training program with another vendor, who, until AMP’s program, was the sole company offering this training locally. AMP’s program is offered in partnership with the Northwest Lineman College, which provides the books and curriculum. Of the two programs to offer the training locally, AMP’s program cost per attendee is the lowest cost option. Thus, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and modify the Master Services Agreement with AMP to include journeyman lineworker safety and training. \n \nThe Division desires to have three two-week classes this year after enrolling attendees in two last year. Overall, the training program is expected to run for four years, with funding provided annually and contingent on mutual agreement between the City and vendor, approval by ordinance of Columbus City Council, and appropriation and certification of funds by the City Auditor\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #22 is $84,360.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $398,084,894.00.\n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen: It was expected there would be additional enrollments as DOP hired new staff.\n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used: Only two programs offer the training locally and AMP’s program cost per attendee is the lowest cost option.\n4.   How was cost determined: The amount is based on AMP’s cost per attendee. \n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nAmerican Municipal Power, Inc. | D365 Vendor #004495 | EIN on file | Expired 1/29/2026 | Nonprofit Organization\nAmerican Municipal Power, Inc. does not hold MBE/FBE status.\n \nSUBCONTRACTOR:\n \nNorthwest Lineman College | D365 Vendor #045774 | EIN on file | Expires 6/20/2025  \n \nNeither the Contractor nor Subcontractor are debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \n$84,360 is available for the training program.
