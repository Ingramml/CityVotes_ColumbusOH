    "title": "To amend City Code Chapter 377, Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement, by repealing and replacing the chapter in its entirety; and to amend City Code Chapter 2337, Freelance Workers, by repealing and replacing the chapter in its entirety.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance repeals and replaces Columbus City Code Chapter 377 and Chapter 2337 with updated chapters that reflect corrected spelling, grammar, and formatting within the chapters. These changes also rename the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission to the Labor Commission.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes changes to City Code Chapter 377 that would rename the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission to the Labor Commission. This change is recommended due to the expanded role of the Commission as established by Ordinance 1016-2023 which created Chapter 2337, Freelance Workers, and updated Chapter 377. Renaming the Commission will provide clarity to the public and to Commission members on the full scope of the Commission’s role.\n \nChapter 377 was created by Ordinance 1802-2020, passed on September 21, 2020. Since then, Commission staff has identified a number of typos, grammatical errors, and formatting inconsistencies within the Chapter. Some errors were found within Chapter 2337 as well, which was created by Ordinance 1016-2023 and passed on May 1, 2023. This ordinance corrects those errors, which appear throughout both chapters. For this reason, repealing and replacing the chapters in their entirety is the most appropriate legislative approach.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. \nTitle\n \nTo amend City Code Chapter 377, Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement, by repealing and replacing the chapter in its entirety; and to amend City Code Chapter 2337, Freelance Workers, by repealing and replacing the chapter in its entirety.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Chapter 377, Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement, by repealing the existing chapter and replacing it in its entirety; and \n \nWHEREAS, this amendment will rename the Commission to the Labor Commission and correct issues of spelling, grammar, and formatting within the chapter; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Chapter 2337, Freelance Workers, by repealing the existing chapter and replacing it in its entirety; and \n \nWHEREAS, this amendment will align with the changes to Chapter 377 and correct issues of spelling, grammar, and formatting within the chapter; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operations of the City for the City Codes to be amended for all of the reasons provided in the background and incorporated fully herein; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That City Code Chapter 377, Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement, be replaced as provided for in the following attachment:\n \nChapter 377 - 2024 Revisions - Final\n \nSECTION 2. That the current version of City Code Chapter 377 is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3. That City Code Chapter 2337, Freelance Workers, be replaced as provided for in the following attachment:\n \nChapter 2337 - 2024 Revisions - Final\n \nSECTION 4. That the current version of City Code Chapter 2337 is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 5. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
