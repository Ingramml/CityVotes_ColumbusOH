The foundation of this free store rests upon the belief in the “divine economy of abundance”, recognizing the importance of community partnerships and local resources while promoting inclusivity for all; and\nWHEREAS, the Free Store has provided free clothing and household items to all people, serving over 50,000 families since opening, offering a safe space that fosters connection and self-worth; and \nWHEREAS, the Free Store turns their storefront into the Christmas Shop, becoming a place for families to pick out new toys and clothes for their children one day every December; and\nWHEREAS, the impactful work of the Free Store led previous Executive Director, the Reverend John Edgar, to receive the Best Humanitarian Award from Columbus Alive in 2019; now, therefore\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council proclaims, recognizes, and celebrates the 25th anniversary of the United Methodist Free Store in the City of Columbus.\n.",
