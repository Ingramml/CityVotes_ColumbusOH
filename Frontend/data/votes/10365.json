    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize October as Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month in the City of Columbus and Recognize the Work of Miles’ Mission \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month occurs annually each October to honor and remember those affected by miscarriage or stillbirth, SIDS, and pregnancy and infant loss; and\n \nWHEREAS, pregnancy loss and infant loss is one of the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes today affecting one in four women and birthing people causing those affected with short- and long-term psychological effects, including grief, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, which may impact maternal health and subsequent pregnancies; and\nWHEREAS, pregnancy and infant loss occurs in families of all races, ethnicities, geographies, abilities, and income levels, it affects our population unevenly--with Black birthing people being 43% more likely than White birthing people to experience a miscarriage, twice as likely to experience a stillbirth, and more than twice as likely to experience an infant loss; and\n \nWHEREAS, these racial disparities can be attributed to many underlying causes, not just biological or genetic, but also persistent systemic inequities in institutional policies and practices, impacting access to quality health care, food, housing, transportation, employment, and education; and \n \nWHEREAS, information about miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant loss is not always widely shared among the general public, which can lead to feelings of isolation among those grieving the loss of a child; and \nWHEREAS, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is observed annually on October 15th, providing space to honor those that have been lost to miscarriage, stillbirth, or infant death, and to raise awareness surrounding the physical and emotional challenges of the families impacted by the loss; and \nWHEREAS, Miles' Mission’s has been an invaluable partner, advocate, and champion for Infant and Maternal Health with an unwavering dedication to raising awareness, improving healthcare systems, promoting mental health, and the creation of a therapeutic environment to support grieving families across Columbus and surrounding regions; and\n \nWHEREAS, the organization fosters a community of remembrance and healing and provides material and emotional support for families who have been impacted by pregnancy and infant loss; now, therefore\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council proclaims, recognizes, and celebrates October as Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month in the City of Columbus and recognizes the unwavering dedication and support Miles’ Mission offers our grieving families affected by their loss.",
