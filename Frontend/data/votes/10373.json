    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify and increase contract numbers PO417294, PO417297, and PO417303, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with DesignLevel, LLC, for the Architectural / Engineering Services - Task Order Basis project. \n \nThese indefinite quantity contracts provide the Office of Construction Management with continual, contractual access to resources that are necessary to perform professional architectural / engineering services as well as provide technical expertise for the Department of Finance and Management to implement projects for various City of Columbus departments.  \n \n2. CONTRACT AWARD:  The Department of Finance solicited Requests for Proposals on July 24, 2023.  DesignLevel, LLC was awarded the contract under Ordinance No. 2682-2023, approved by City Council on October 16, 2023.  \n \n3. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.                     The amt of additional funds to be expended under the modification:   $125,000.00 for the Department of Public Safety \n \n\n\n\nOriginal Contracts: PO417294, PO417297, PO417303\n\n$750,000.00\n\n\n\nModification No. 1 (current)\n\n$125,000.00\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nTotal (Original and Renewal)\n\n$875,000.00\n\n\n \nB.                     Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nThe original term of the contracts is one year from the date of issuance of the purchase order, with the option for up to three (3) annual renewals.  The expiration date of these contract is November 24, 2024.  The Department would like to modify the contract to extend the expiration date to read “The term of the contract is one year from the date of issuance of the purchase order or, until all funds are depleted, with the option for up to three annual renewals”.\n \nThe addition of $125,000.00 would be considered an annual renewal under the terms of the contract mentioned above.\n \nC. Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\n                     A portion of the $125,000.00 for Public Safety will be used against tasks already in process and in need of additional funding.\n \nD.                     How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nThe $125,000.00 is the same amount that was requested in the original contract and is in line with expected needs for 2025.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: DAX No. 11513, expires 8/11/25, Majority-designated\n \n4. FUTURE RENEWALS:  The term of the original contract and this modification will allow up to two more annual renewals.  Future renewals will be processed via legislative process.\n \n5.

Bonds Fund for this expenditure.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase contracts with DesignLevel, LLC, for the Architectural / Engineering Services - Task Order Basis project; and to authorize an expenditure up to $125,000.00 within the Safety General Obligations Bonds Fund.  ($125,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Finance and Management Department, Office of Construction Management, desires to modify and increase contract numbers PO417294, PO417297, and PO417303 for the Architectural / Engineering Services - Task Order Basis project with DesignLevel, LLC; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contracts were originally authorized under Ordinance No. 2682-2023 and approved by City Council on October 16, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department would like to modify the contract to extend the expiration date to read “The term of the contract is one year from the date of issuance of the purchase order or, until all funds are depleted, with the option for up to three annual renewals”; and\n \nWHEREAS, an increase of $125,000.00 is also being requested to fund Department of Public Safety projects and is in line with the original terms of the contract regarding annual renewals; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds within the Safety G.O.
