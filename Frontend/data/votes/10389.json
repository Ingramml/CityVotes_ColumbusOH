    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with the Franklin Park Conservatory for the administration and implementation of the Franklin Park Master Plan and related capital improvement projects. The amount being authorized by this ordinance is $700,000.00.\n \nFranklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens requested capital support from the City of Columbus in 2023 to fund three capital projects. This $700,000.00 commitment from the City of Columbus supports replacement of biome air handlers. Air handlers are vital to the plant collections and guest experience, in some cases, providing heating and cooling. This modernization project is long overdue, as the existing handlers are 30-years old, corroded, and inefficient. One replacement will cost $250,000, with several such replacements needed throughout the facilities to improve efficiency, reliability, and reduce ongoing maintenance needs. This commitment also supports the modernization of audio and visual equipment in the Conservatory as systems date back to 2008 and 2009. Replacement of speakers, controls, and audio-visual capabilities for external client and internal staff use, remote meetings, and learning is needed. Adding new, modern speakers throughout the Conservatory provides improved life safety announcements, the ability to page guests and staff, and the playing themed music for guests’ enjoyment. Laptops and other supporting equipment will bring the total project cost to $250,000, supporting improved communications, safety, and overall efficiency. Lastly, this commitment supports flooring, wall, and door replacements and renovations. Surfaces throughout the Conservatory facilities are in need of replacement and repair, including tile, wood, and other floors, as well as, 30-year old doors, and damaged walls. Improvements will be made to enhance longevity and safety, such as installing doors with added security features and adding protection on corners and baseboards to reduce future wall damage. This $200,000 project will improve safety and reduce regular maintenance costs.\n \nIt has been determined that it is beneficial for the Franklin Park Conservatory to perform the administration of these projects to allow for the least disruption to the daily operations of Conservatory business. The funds will be used to reimburse the Conservatory for expenditures in conjunction with these projects as part of the implementation of the Master Plan for the Conservatory and Franklin Park.\n \nPrincipal Parties:\nFranklin Park Conservatory Joint Recreation District\n1777 East Broad Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43203\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow the City to reimburse the Franklin Park Conservatory as soon as possible as plans for the park are moving forward and work has commenced. \n \nBenefits to the Public: These improvements will benefit the community by enhancing the visitor experience, creating a more attractive destination for Central Ohio residents and beyond.
