    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Axis Civil Construction, LLC for the Raymond and Wilson Golf Course Bridge Improvements 2023 Package Two Project. The contract amount is $163,386.00, with alternates of $133,908.00 and a contingency of $30,000.00, for a total of $327,294.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nIn 2023, several bridges were improved at the Raymond Memorial and Wilson Road Golf Courses based on recommendations from the Bi-annual Bridge Inspections. During this 2023 project, two bridges were identified as requiring additional structural improvement in order to provide access for heavier maintenance equipment and emergency medical service vehicles. The extent of improvement needed for these two bridges resulted in the development of this Package Two. The current condition of these bridges impacts course play, course revenue, and inhibites access of larger vehicles. \n \nThis project will install the needed structural improvements for these pedestrian and golf cart bridges to ensure consistent aesthetics, more efficient usage of cart rentals, and safe accessible bridges. This project will begin in fall 2024 and finish by the end of spring 2025.
