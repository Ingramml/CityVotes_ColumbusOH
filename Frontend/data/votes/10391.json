    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group to provide professional services associated with the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Trail Connector Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $114,754.00.\n \nThis project includes a new pedestrian bridge, floodwall modifications, and a Franklinton neighborhood connection by a trail that runs along Souder Avenue from West Broad Street to the Scioto Trail at Dublin Road. This modification is for additional engineering services required due to known and unknown permitting needs along with additional construction-phase support. Part of this modification is for a planned Letter of Map Revision through FEMA to account for changes in the base flood elevation from the new bridge. This work was anticipated during design and will be performed post-construction. During the design phase, stream bank scouring occurred along the bank from the causeway. To restore the stream bank, additional permitting is needed through the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA). Additional services will also need provided to address ongoing construction submittals and questions. This modification will allow the project to be completed on schedule and to satisfy all permit requirements. The cost was determined by established hourly rates and negotiated hours to complete the additional scope of work by the project team.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nKevin Grathwol, (614) 210-0751\nContract Compliance Number: 006560\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 24, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to complete the design plans and bid the construction project on schedule, meeting the grant funding deadline for construction and restoring erosion damage to the streambank to help prevent further erosion.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The Souder Avenue Bridge is one of the City's most unsafe crossings, averaging 250 pedestrian and cyclist uses per day. This project will provide a new separated facility to enhance safety. It will also connect the Franklinton Loop and trail network to an underserved community.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Recreation and Parks Department conducted extensive outreach involving public and private stakeholders in the Franklinton community. The outreach included civic associations, Mt. Carmel Hospital, Cover My Meds, Columbus Health, YAY bikes, and more. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides equitable and safe access to the trail system for underserved communities. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,027,104.18 was legislated for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Connector project by Ordinances 1280-2018, 0046-2020, and 0662-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $114,754.00. $114,754.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
