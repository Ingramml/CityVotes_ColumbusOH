    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Environmental Design Group, LLC for the Dry Run Stream Bank Restoration and Repair Project. The contract amount is $201,729.33, with a contingency of $33,770.00, for a total of $235,499.33 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nDry Run Stream is one of the most heavily impacted streams in Columbus. As a tributary of the Scioto River, this seven square mile watershed flows through the Hilltop and Westgate Communities. This section of Dry Run is adjacent to Westmoor School, Westmoor Park, a YMCA, and a church with a day care facility.  \n \nIn April 2024, an unusually large rain event did significant damage to the Dry Run Stream Corridor. This project will provide construction documents for bidding to repair the stream corridor which has damaged adjacent parkland and threatens the adjacent Camp Chase Railway. The Recreation and Parks Department will need to complete the design in order to obtain State and Federal permits for the restoration work. Construction is anticipated to start towards the end of 2025, or early 2026, and be complete shortly thereafter.\n \nThe goal of this project is to provide a fully functional floodplain, stream channel, and habitat recovery zone within its limits. The project will also provide a significant educational opportunity for students at Westmoor School and will restore an expanded passive recreation area for the Hilltop Neighborhood.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): \nEvery two years, the Recreation and Parks Department pre-qualifies professional service vendors to provide Engineering, Architectural, and Construction Management Services. During each prequalification period, the Department enters into contracts for various services to facilitate the execution of our Capital Improvements Plan. Ordinance 2467-2022 authorized the pre-qualified arrangement for the period of 2022 to 2024. The contracts being authorized by this ordinance are being awarded utilizing the pre-qualified list of vendors, as previously authorized by 2467-2022. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEnvironmental Design Group, LLC\n7965 North High Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43235                                                     \nBoris Slogar, (800) 835-1390\nContract Compliance Number: 003292\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 31, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to complete the design portion of this project immediately so that construction can start as soon as possible in order to stop erosion damage to city property and improve the safety of this area. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will provide infrastructure protection with access to a quarter mile of stream corridor for the public and adjacent properties, including Westmoor Park, two schools, the Hilltop YMCA, and Glenwood Church.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community support for this project has been received from key stakeholders near the site including Columbus City Schools and the Central Ohio YMCA.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Greater Hilltop (53)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving water quality and health for the community.
