    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with V3 Construction Group, LTD. for the Alum Creek Stream Stabilization Project. The contract amount is $243,822.00, with a contingency of $40,000.00, for a total of $283,822.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $285,822.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nStreambank erosion along Alum Creek, near Cooper Park and Harbour Pointe Apartments, poses a risk to the Alum Creek Trail. The trail is located on a shared-use easement between Alum Creek and the Harbour Pointe retaining wall, both of which are at risk of becoming unsafe due to the encroaching erosion. Without prompt streambank stabilization, the trail could fail and collapse into the creek, leading to hazardous conditions for public use and prohibiting any future reconstruction. The project will regrade the bank to reduce the erosive forces of the creek, install riprap in areas with the highest storm water velocity, and apply a vegetation-reinforced coir mat wrap with live stakes to stabilize the bank. Additionally, the project will focus on removing invasive vegetation and planting native trees to enhance the ecological health of the area. \n \nThis project is primarily being funded by the National Church Residences (NCR) as part of their commitment to mitigate a stream corridor protection zone variance in the Bliss Run Alum Creek Watershed, a requirement mandated by the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage. The project is scheduled to start in fall 2024 and be complete by spring 2025.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 6, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 27, 2024.
