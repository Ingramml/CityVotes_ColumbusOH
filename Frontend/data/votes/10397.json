    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten education for every 4-year-old.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nChildren who participate in high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills. Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate.\n \nIt is crucial that all families in all communities have access to high-quality early education programs.  Unfortunately, 110 Southside families were going to lose access to their early education program at the Reeb Avenue Center as the former provider planned to close their business.  Knowing that those families and children needed to be served, Columbus Early Learning Centers (CELC), a non-profit corporation, quickly moved into the Reeb Avenue site and enrolled most of the children from the former provider.  \n \nThe Office of Education requests the authority enter into a contract with CELC to help support their new operations at the Reeb Avenue location.\n \nThis contract will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329.30. The Mayor’s Office of Education has neither the capacity nor the expertise to perform this role.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $100,000.00 from the 2024 Mayor’s Office of Education General Fund budget. ($100,000.00)\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \nEmergency designation is requested to provide operational support to CELC as their costs quickly increased due to this unexpected and unbudgeted work.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to enter into a contract Columbus Early Learning Centers to provide them operational support at their new Reeb Avenue site; to authorize the transfer of $40,000.00 from the citywide (general fund) account to the Office of Education; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Mayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that all children have access to a high-quality early education; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is crucial that all families in all communities have access to high-quality education programs; and \n \nWHEREAS, 110 Southside families were in danger of losing early education programming for their children; and \n \nWHEREAS, CELC moved into the former site to support those children and families; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Education requests the authority to provide operational support to CELC; and\n \nWHEREAS, this contract is being awarded to the CELC pursuant to Section 329.30, for which the City does not supply such services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with Columbus Early Learning Centers to support their new operations as soon as possible to avoid service interruption, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
