    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services agreement with Osborn Engineering, for the Division of Water (DOW) Safety Improvements Project, in an amount up to $219,300.00, for Division of Water Contract No. 2206.\n \nThis project will provide preliminary design, detailed design and bidding, and engineering services during construction to address safety related needs at various Division of Water facilities.  \n \nThe Community planning is “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT: This project will address miscellaneous safety needs at various Division of Water facilities, which will improve employee working conditions and reduce the potential for employee injuries.  Most improvements will occur within secure areas that are not accessible to the public; for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for improvements that occur within areas accessible to the public, but at this time, outreach is not expected to be needed.  The consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying DPU’s environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3. BID INFORMATION:  The selection of the firm providing the professional engineering services has been performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Columbus City Code, Section 329, \"Awarding professional service contracts through requests for proposals.\"  The evaluation criteria for this contract included:  1. understanding of project/project approach, 2. past performance, 3. environmentally preferable consultant, 4. local workforce, and 5. anticipated project team.\n \nRequest for Proposals (RFP) were received on October 16, 2020 from:  Osborn Engineering, LJB Inc., and Star Consultants.\n \nAn evaluation committee reviewed the proposal and recommends that the DOW Safety Improvements Project be awarded to Osborn Engineering.\n \nThe Contract Compliance Number for Osborn Engineering is 34-0445030 (expires 7/30/21, MAJ) and their DAX Vendor Number is 6417.  Additional information regarding all bidders, description of work, contract time frame, and detailed amounts can be found on the attached Information form.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Osborn Engineering.\n \n4.  FUTURE RENEWALS:  The Division anticipates two renewals to this agreement for detailed design and bidding services and engineering services during construction.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT: The total amount needed is $219,300.00.\n \nThe 2020 Bond Sale request includes $175,000.00 for this project. Until proceeds from the Bond Sale are received, a transfer from the Water System Reserve Fund - Fund No. 6003 to the Water G.O. Bond Fund - Fund No. 6006 will be needed so the project can proceed.  This transaction is only a temporary measure.\n \nThe remaining $44,300.00 needed will require a transfer within the Water G.O. Voted Funds Fund - Fund No. 6006, as well as an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services agreement with Osborn Engineering, for the Division of Water (DOW) Safety Improvements Project; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $175,000.00 from the Water System Reserve Fund to the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; to authorize a transfer of $44,300.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure up to $219,300.00 from the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; for the Division of Water; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.   ($219,300.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, three (3) technical proposals for professional engineering services for the Division of Water (DOW) Safety Improvements Project were received on October 16, 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities recommends that the agreement be awarded to Osborn Engineering; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City anticipates incurring certain Original Expenditures (as defined in Section 1.150-2(c) of the Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) with respect to the construction of the Project described in this Ordinance (collectively, the “Project”); and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $175,000.00 from the Water System Reserve Fund - Fund No. 6003 to the Water G.O.
