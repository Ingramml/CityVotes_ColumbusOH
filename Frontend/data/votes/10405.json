    "description": "BACKGROUND:  \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into an initial contract with qualified vendor, The Ohio State University. The Ohio State University will be funded for the delivery of STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) services.

This is done to provide information on patients presenting for care in STD and family planning clinical settings, and to explore evolving health information technologies to improve STD surveillance nationwide. This information will allow CDC, as well as state and local health departments, to better understand the epidemiology of STDs and to inform national and local STD prevention efforts. This ordinance is contingent on the passing of Ordinance 2399-2024.\nThe contract period is from September 30, 2024 through September 29, 2025, in an amount not to exceed $104,397.00.
