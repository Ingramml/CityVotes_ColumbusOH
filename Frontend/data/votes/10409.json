    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Fund The Climb Foundation, a non-profit corporation, in support of their Peaceful Living United + Sober (PLUS) Housing Program.\n \nThe mission of Fund The Climb Foundation is to remove barriers that stand in the way of patients seeking treatment for the brain disease of addiction. Donations are used to advance education and prevention of substance use disorder as well as to assist with housing, transportation, nutrition and personal hygiene needs for those courageous enough to break the cycle of addiction and enter treatment.\n \nOne of the ways that Fund The Climb Foundation supports patients seeking treatment for the disease of addiction is to provide housing to those who have no safe, sober place to live while in treatment. This could be due to homelessness, human trafficking, domestic violence, and/or various unsafe conditions, making it extremely difficult for patients to focus on their recovery.  Fund The Climb, through its P.L.U.S. (Peaceful Living United + Sober) Housing Program, and also in collaboration with housing partners, provides safe accommodations to patients in need while in treatment. Funds are needed for rent, utilities, basic furnishings, supplies, and maintenance.\n \nThis agreement will assist in covering utilities for patients, as well as increasing the capacity to house patients during recovery and ensure high-quality living spaces.\n                       \nFISCAL IMPACT: The funding of $33,500.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is requested in order to immediately meet housing needs for patients currently in treatment for substance use disorder. \n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Fund The Climb Foundation in support of their Peaceful Living United + Sober (PLUS) Housing Program; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $33,500.00 within the Neighborhoods Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
