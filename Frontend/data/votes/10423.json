    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify a contract with Ohio Machinery Co.  Ordinance# 2900-2021 authorized for the purchase of two (2) Single Axle CNG Dump Trucks.  There have been several price increases since the order was placed and additional funds are needed.  The price increase was anticipated and included in the contingency of Ordinance 2900-2021 but we did not anticipate such a large increase.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities is in the process of purchasing two (2) Single Axle CNG Dump Trucks the Division of Water to haul gravel, dirt, and pull trailers for equipment operators.  The original purchase and contract was authorized by Ordinance 2900-2021 (ACPO008140).   \n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Part Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nSUPPLIER:     Ohio Machinery Co., Vendor# 006428, expires 5/8/26.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:   The Department of Public Utilities (DPU) is requesting emergency legislation for the two dump trucks because Ohio Machinery is attempting to deliver and we cannot process the invoices or add them to our assets until the PO has sufficient funding. The original PO is insufficient due to receiving quotes at years end in 2020 and using those quotes to formulate a PO. Also, the company issued the original PO was bought out and renamed. The trucks also suffered from volatile price increases during the pandemic. The two dump trucks are valuable assets that need to be added to DPU asset lists so The Division of Water can maintain a high level of service to the rate payers and continue to provide quality drinking water. \n                  \nFiscal Impact:  The expenditure was legislated by Ordinance 2900-2021. The existing contract and purchase order PO339949 for these trucks was funded by the existing auditor's certificate ACPO008140.  This ordinance will provide authorization to modify the previously authorized contract and purchase order amount by $141,165.00.  $141,165.00 is budgeted and available in the Water Operating Fund to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized for this purchase, including this modification, is $519,905.00.  \n \n$272,228.00 spent on similar purchases in 2023.\n$0.00 was spent on similar purchases in 2022.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to establish a purchase order with Ohio Machinery Co. in the amount of $141,165.00 for the price increase to purchase two (2) Single Axle CNG Dump Trucks for the Division of Water; to authorize the expenditure of $141,165.00 from the Water Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($141,165.00).\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify an existing contract (PO339949) with Ohio Machinery Co. to provide additional funding for the purchase of two (2) Single Axle CNG Dump Trucks for the Division of Water.  The Dump Trucks will be used by the Division of Water to haul gravel, dirt, and pull trailers for equipment operators; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $141,165.00 for additional costs from the Water Operating Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance for additional funds to purchase two (2) Single Axle CNG Dump Trucks with Ohio Machinery Co., as Ohio Machinery Co. is attempting to deliver the assets but invoices cannot be processed until the Purchase Order has sufficient funding, and to avoid a decrease in quality service to rate payers, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management be and is hereby authorized to establish a purchase order with Ohio Machinery Co., 3993 E. Royalton Rd., Broadview Heights, OH 44147 for the additional cost of $141,165.00 to purchase of two (2) Single Axle CNG Dump Trucks for the Division of Water.  \n \nSE21CTION 2.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $141,165.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from Water Operating Fund in object class 06 Vehicles per the accounting coeds in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure, which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
