    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize the Strength, Courage and Perseverance of Millions of Refugees and to Celebrate June 20th, 2021 as World Refugee Day in the City of Columbus.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 55/76 on December 4, 2000, to officially recognize June 20th as World Refugee Day. This year’s theme is “Together we heal, learn and shine;” and\n \nWHEREAS, every 20 minutes people leave everything behind to escape war, persecution and terror. An unprecedented 70.8 million people around the world have been forced from their homes by conflict and persecution at the end of 2018. More than 16,000 refugees have resettled in the Central Ohio area since 1983, with most of them arriving within the last 10 years; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has a proud history of welcoming refugees by offering a safe and thriving environment to support displaced persons and families seeking a new beginning; and\n \nWHEREAS, there is a network of resettlement agencies who are actively working with refugees in Columbus regardless of their country of origin or religious beliefs; and\n \nWHEREAS, through resiliency, self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship, local refugees have established new paths and built networks of support and commerce which have had a positive impact in Columbus for new and existing residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, the local refugee community contributes an estimated $1.6 billion to the Columbus economy and supports over 21,000 jobs in the region; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate June 20th, 2021 as World Refugee Day and renews its commitment to welcoming and supporting all New Americans in the City of Columbus.",
