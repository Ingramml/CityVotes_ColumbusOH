The city took swift action to significantly limit potential exposure, including severing internet connectivity, to reduce the threat to the city's systems. The Department of Technology worked diligently and continues to remediate this cybersecurity incident (the \"Incident\") and restore the city's electronic security and safety.\nOn July 30, 2024, Mayor Ginther executed a Mayor’s Emergency Letter and declared the Incident to be a clear and present danger to public health, safety, welfare or property.  It was then necessary to enter into a legal professional services contract with Dinsmore & Shohl LLC and their named cybersecurity subcontractors (RSM US LLP, Digital Mint, Haystack, Experian, CDWG and others) for an amount up to $4,000,000.00 to provide breach counsel services in response to the Incident. The Department, through the City Attorney, chose Dinsmore & Shohl LLC, due to its being a law firm with a national reputation for data breach response excellence that also has a strong presence in Ohio. Dinsmore's Data Breach Team consists of attorneys with decades of combined experience who are dedicated solely to critical, cybersecurity incident response.  \nIt is now necessary to modify the original contract with Dinsmore in order to add funding in the amount of $3,000,000.00 to cover additional costs that have accumulated due to the Incident.  The original contract amount was based on an estimate formed at the beginning of the Incident response.  As the investigation has continued, additional expenses have been incurred necessitating additional funds in the amount of $3,000,000.00 for a total contract amount of $7,000,000.00. \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Dinsmore & Shohl LLP is CC004121 and expires 9/11/2026.\n3.
