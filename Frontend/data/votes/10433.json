    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Builderscape, Inc. for the Hauntz Park Improvements Project. The contract amount is $2,213,800.00, with $25,000.00 in alternates and a contingency of $261,200.00, for a total of $2,500,000.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $2,502,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nHauntz Park, located at 480 Columbian Avenue, is a 5.6 acre neighborhood park in Columbus' Greater Hilltop Community. The park has seen little change since the late 1990s and has experienced declining use due to increasing concerns about illicit activity. Residents have actively requested the City to rejuvenate the park. The deteriorated shelter, small playground, and sports courts will need to be demolished to make way for new improvements. Field space is limited in the Hilltop. The Hilltop Vision Plan calls for more green space and recreational opportunities. \n \nThe proposed upgrades include an improved playground, basketball court, small skatepark, open lawn, and picnic areas. Passive recreation amenities, such as a walking loop and gathering spaces, will also be added. Infrastructure improvements will enhance site drainage and include the creation of a constructed wetland, pollinator meadow, and boardwalk for public enjoyment. These improvements will enhance the park's sense of place, complementing the surrounding residential community's era and architecture. Construction is anticipated to begin in fall 2024 and be completed by fall 2025.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 27, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 20, 2024.
