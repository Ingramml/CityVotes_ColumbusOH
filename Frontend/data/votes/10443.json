    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court, Clerk of Court (\"Municipal Court Clerk\") to enter into a one (1) year contract with Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx”) for commercial carrier service in the amount up to $100,000.00.\n \nOrdinance 2248-2023 authorized the Municipal Court Clerk to enter into a contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier services on civil cases which allows for a more efficient and effective means of service. \nThe Municipal Court Clerk began implementation of FedEx service in October 2023 based on a request from the Municipal Court Judges. This legislation allows there to be no interruption of FedEx service being offered to the public. \nBid Information: Ordinance 3278-2022 was approved for the purpose of purchasing a sole source add-on integration to the Clerk’s current case management system, CourtView II. CourtView will only accept FedEx to interface with their system. CourtView is proprietary; therefore, we can only interface with FedEx. \nThe O.R.C. Section 9.48 (D) permits the Municipal Court Clerk to participate in a program operated by a state association of political subdivisions and any purchases made are exempt from any competitive selection processes otherwise required by law. FedEx offers a discounted rate as a part of the Courts Program and is the sole company offering this cost-saving program for courts, thus making it manifestly impractical to bid.\nOrdinance 2248-2023 authorized the Municipal Court Clerk to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code for the original contract. \nContract Compliance:  71-0427007\nExpiration Date: 7/19/2025\nDAX Vendor Number: 009933\n \nContracts:\nOrdinance: 2248-2023; $200,000.00; PO411015\nOrdinance: 1468-2024; $0.00; PO411015\nOrdinance: 2573-2024; $100,000.00\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the excluded party listing system of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved finding for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funds totaling $100,000.00 are available within the General Fund budget. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Municipal Court Clerk, to enter into the contract with FedEx Corporation for commercial carrier service for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Municipal Court Clerk has a need to continue to offer FedEx service options to ensure proper service procedures are met; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code as it is manifestly impractical to bid due to the significant savings; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 within the General Fund; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Clerk of Courts to authorize the contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier services to avoid interruption in services, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Municipal Court Clerk be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with FedEx Corporation for the provision of commercial carrier services for the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure sum of $100,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, be and hereby is authorized in the General Fund 1000, in Object Class 03 - Contractual Services per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \nSECTION 3.  That this Council finds that it is in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code in order to enter into this contract and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds are hereby deemed appropriated, and expenditures authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which are hereby made a part of hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
