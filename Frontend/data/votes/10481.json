    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation seeks to amend Ordinance No. 2022-2023 which was passed by Council on July 24, 2023. This amendment seeks to increase the amount of the contract, to allow for the reimbursement of expenses incurred before the purchase order date, and to extend the time of the agreement.\n \nOrdinance No. 1366-2021, passed by Council on June 21, 2021, authorized a contract for services with EcoMap Technologies, Inc., to develop a small business portal to meet all needs except need number 6 as identified in the assessment and subsequently detailed in the Columbus Small Business Agenda that was released to the public in December 2019.  \nOrdinance No. 2022-2023 was passed by Council on July 24, 2023. This ordinance authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract for the maintenance of the Columbus Small Biz Hub with EcoMap Technologies, Inc.\n \nThis amendment seeks to allow for the reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the execution of the purchase order but in no event before January 1, 2022. This provision should have been included in Ordinance No. 2022-2023 as the contract was for services that were provided as of January 1, 2022, as this contract operates on the calendar year.\n \nFurther, this ordinance seeks to add additional funds to this contract to allow for the contract to be extended from a one-year to a four-year contract. After negotiation with EcoMap Technologies, this three-year extension will only cost an additional $54,1700.00 as compared to the initial budgeted cost of $39,550.00 for the first year.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to ensure there is no disruption in services to the small businesses that the small business portal provides.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s number is 035642 and expires 9/12/2025.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding of $54,170.00 has been allocated from the Economic Development Division’s 2024 General Fund Budget and funding of $39,550.00 is currently available on ACPO009389.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 2022-2023 to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to extend the contract term with EcoMap Technologies, Inc. to maintain a comprehensive web-based platform for three years; to allow for the payment of expenses incurred prior to the purchase order date; to authorize the additional expenditure of up to $54,170.00 from the 2024 General Fund Operating Budget; and to declare an emergency. ($54,170.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, EcoMap Technologies, Inc. founded in 2018, is a software company that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to build custom platforms that help support communities such as local resource databases and small business navigators.  The database helps entrepreneurs find resources for their startups, small businesses and nonprofits within their local community; and   \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1366-2021, passed by City Council on June 21, 2021, authorized a contract for services with EcoMap Technologies, Inc. to develop a small business portal; and \n \nWHEREAS, a second contract with EcoMap Technologies, Inc., approved in Ordinance No. 2022-2023 on July 24, 2023, provided for maintenance of the small business portal that will continue to serve to meet needs identified in the Columbus Small Business Agenda that was released to the public in December 2019; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development can save costs by amending Ordinance No. 2022-2023 to allow for funding to enter into a multi-year contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow for the reimbursement of expenses incurred before the execution of the purchase order as services were provided starting on January 1, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract to prevent interruption in services, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     Ordinance No. 2022-2023 is hereby amended as follows with deletions struck through and additions underlined:\n \n                     SECTION 2.   That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into contract with EcoMap Technologies, Inc. in an amount up to $39,550.00 $93,720.00 to maintain a database service.\n \n                     SECTION 3.   That for the purpose stated in Section 2, the expenditure of $39,550.00 $93,720.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept. 44-02 (Economic Development), in Object Class 03 (Contractual Services) per the accounting                      codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \n                     SECTION 4.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to reimburse for expenses incurred prior to the execution of the purchase order but in no event for any expenses incurred before January 1, 2022.\n \nSECTION 4 5.   That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5 6.    That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6 7.   That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to reimburse for expenses incurred prior to the execution of the purchase order but in no event for any expenses incurred before January 1, 2022.\n \nSECTION 3.   That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.    That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.   That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
