    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for approximately $1.3 billion in discretionary grant funding for FY 2024 through the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) grant program. This is the third round of funding for the SS4A grant program.  The amended NOFO was released on April 16, 2024 and remained open through August 29, 2024.\n \nThe purpose of SS4A grants is to improve roadway safety by significantly reducing or eliminating roadway fatalities and serious injuries through safety action plan development and implementation focused on all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation users, motorists, personal conveyance and micromobility users, and commercial vehicle operators. The program provides funding to develop the tools to help strengthen a community’s approach to roadway safety and save lives and is designed to meet the needs of diverse local, Tribal, and regional communities that differ dramatically in size, location, and experience administering Federal funding.  There are two types of funding: Planning (including supplemental planning) and Demonstration Grants; and Implementation Grants.  The City meets the criteria to be eligible to request either type of funding.\n \nWhen Columbus worked with community partners to launch Vision Zero Columbus in 2020, it made a commitment to protecting lives above all else on the city’s transportation system.  The proposed Vulnerable Road User project helps carry this commitment forward. Vision Zero Columbus crash data have already confirmed that Columbus’ Vulnerable Road Users and Communities of Interest have suffered a disproportionate share of the traffic violence in Columbus. The Vulnerable Road User project will provide the data analysis and plan updates necessary to ensure Columbus is able to equitably, comprehensively prioritize the most vulnerable road users and communities in executing the 2023-2028 Vision Zero Action Plan and other transportation plans. In particular, the funding would support the following:\n \n•                     Development of a Comprehensive Vulnerable Road User Safety Plan that will include development of a pedestrian priority network (that does not currently exist for City of Columbus), an implementation toolbox, and a new 5-year Safe Routes to School District Wide School Travel Plan\n•                     Development of a Lighting for Safety Prioritization Plan in collaboration with Division of Power at Department of Public Utilities. This would update their existing policy to better define safety in alignment with Vision Zero Columbus as they prioritize the installation of new lighting.                 \n \nThe Department estimates the total cost of the supplemental planning programs to be approximately $1.65 million.  It anticipates requesting approximately $1.32 million in SS4A funding USDOT, and it anticipates this SS4A award will provide approximately 80% of the proposed supplemental planning activities.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a SS4A Program Grant, execute agreements with USDOT or others in connection with the award of the grant, expend awarded grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved and appropriated in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to apply for a Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Program Grant from the United States Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of the grant and other requisite agreements for the acceptance and administration of said grant; and to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced the third round of funding for the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Grant Program, which is a grant program awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City meets the eligibility criteria to submit a SS4A planning grant application relative to the City’s Vision Zero Action Plan due to it being a comprehensive safety action plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department is requesting SS4A funding develop a Comprehensive Vulnerable Road User Safety Plan and Lighting for Safety Prioritization Plan and support other action items in the Vision Zero Action Plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department estimates the total cost of the planning programs to be approximately $1.65 million, and anticipates requesting approximately $1.32 million in SS4A funding from the USDOT, which is 80% of the funding for the planning programs; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDOT accepted applications for the FY 2024 funding round through August 29, 2024; and \n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from USDOT’s SS4A program; to accept said grants, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 3.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
