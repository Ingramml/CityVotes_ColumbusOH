    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. to add additional funds to augment the original scope of services in the Asset Work Order System (AWOS) project. \n \nOrdinance 2748-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. in the amount of up to $549,590.00 for the AWOS project. The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service an improved Work Order and Asset Management System to provide the ability to view, manage assets, create work orders, monitor resources across the enterprise with the capability to “measure and manage” performance, identify needs, plan work, and report with the highest level of transparency available. The department is requesting additional functionality that was not included in the original scope of services. Including these additional functions now enhances software integrations and customizations allowing for more automation and increased efficiencies of AWOS.  Section 2.1 of the underlying contract authorizes the City to expand the scope of services of the contract along with a right to cancel the contract at any time without a predetermined contract termination date.\n \nThis planned contract modification adds additional funds for software maintenance, and technical support and adds additional code modification enhancements related to the Asset Work Order System (AWOS) project. \n \n1.1                     Amount of additional funds to be expended: $250,000.00\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $250,000.00.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $ 549,590.00                     (PO4203748, Ord. 2748-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $ 250,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $ 799,590.00\n \n1.2                     Reason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThis is a modification that is necessary to add additional funds to pay for software maintenance, technical support, and additional software coding related to the Asset Work Order System (AWOS) project. \n \n1.3                     Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe Asset Work Order System (AWOS) project was formally advertised, bids were evaluated and the proposal from Woolpert, Inc. was selected by the committee as the best. Annual contract modifications will continue to be required for maintenance and support related to this custom software. It is in the best interest of the city to modify this contract with Woolpert, Inc. in order to avoid having to duplicate efforts thereby costing the City extra funds to implement.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract as negotiated during the RFP/RFQ process.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Woolpert, Inc. is CC001040 and expires 04/17/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $125,000.00 is available within Fund 6500, Mobility Enterprise Fund. The remaining amount of $125,000.00 is available in Fund 2265, the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund.  All funds are budgeted and appropriated.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:\nThe department requests emergency designation for this ordinance so that work can continue developing the Asset Work Order System (AWOS) project computer systems so that they can be put into service as quickly as possible for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. for the Asset Work Order System (AWOS) project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Fund, and the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, and to declare an emergency.
