    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) began accepting applications for its Municipal Bridge Program on July 1, 2024, and applications were due August 15, 2024.  The Municipal Bridge Program provides federal funds to municipal corporations, metroparks and Regional Transit Authorities for bridge replacement or bridge rehabilitation projects.  ODOT will cover up to 80% of eligible costs for preliminary engineering and construction, and it also has limited availability of 15% Toll Revenue Credit (TRC) for construction phase only - as long as TRC is available.  Total awards are capped at $2.5 million.  In order to receive funding, a bridge must either be on ODOT’s Target Bridge List or be eligible due to inspection results received after the list was generated.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application to rehabilitate the Ohio Center Way bridge (Bridge Structure File Number 2563126) over CSX’s and Norfolk Southern’s railroad tracks at the convention center.  The project would also replace the bridge’s existing asphalt overlay with a new concrete overlay, and other repairs as needed.  The Department estimates the total project cost will be approximately $1,039,300.00, and it is requesting $797,335.00 from ODOT’s Municipal Bridge Program.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with ODOT in connection with the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved and appropriated in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to apply for a Municipal Bridge Program Grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with ODOT and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) announced funding for its Municipal Bridge Program, which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City meets the eligibility criteria to submit a Municipal Bridge Program grant application relative to the Ohio Center Way bridge; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department estimates the total project cost will be approximately $1,039,300.00, and it is requesting $797,335.00 from ODOT’s Municipal Bridge Program, which is 76.7% of the funding for the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT accepted applications through August 15, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from ODOT’s Municipal Bridge Program to replace its Ohio Center Way bridge (Bridge Structure File Number 2563126) over CSX’s and Norfolk Southern’s railroad tracks at the convention center; to accept said grants, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 3.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
