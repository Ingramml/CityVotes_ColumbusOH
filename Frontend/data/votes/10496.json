    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. formerly IBI Group Engineering Services (USA), Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Arterial - SR161 - I71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase 2 project.\nOrdinance 3324-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. for the Arterial - SR161 - I71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase 2 project.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources for the preparation of preliminary engineering documents and detailed design plans for the second of multiple phases targeted to improve safety and increase multi-modal access throughout the East Dublin-Granville Road/SR161 corridor between I-71 and Cleveland Avenue. This phase will provide improvements to SR161 from Ambleside Drive/Satinwood Drive to Maple Canyon Avenue. The side streets of Sharon Woods Boulevard/Tamarack Boulevard and Beechcroft Road will be improved north and south of SR161.  Ordinance Ord. 3221-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $800,000.00. \n \nOrdinance 2534-2022 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to submit MORPC Attributable Funds roadway improvement project applications for consideration for funding within the Transportation Improvement Program and to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute project agreements for approved projects for the Department of Public Service for the Arterial - SR161 - I71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase 2. \n \nOrdinance 2424-2023 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify contracts with IBI Group Engineering Services to allow the assignment of all past, present and future contracts from IBI Group Engineering Services to Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $800,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $850,000.00     (PO308007, Ord. 3324-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $800,000.00     (PO422132, Ord. 3221-2023) \nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                                    $800,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n       \nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $2,450,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe amount initially legislated for this project did not include the full amount that would be needed to fund this project through final design and construction services. There will be future modifications as funds become available.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe full amount of the contract was not initially available, therefore it was planned that contract would be modified as funds became available to complete the project.  It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nArcadis/IBI and subconsultants provided a cost breakdown for each task included in the scope. After several negotiations, the final fee was determined to be in line with what is expected for the scope of work. Costs were also compared to other recent design project of similar scope and magnitude.  The cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. is CC009409 and expires 2/22/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $800,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to meet the deadlines for the federal funding, to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n                     \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Arcadis Engineering Services (USA) Inc. in connection with the Arterial - SR161 - I71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase 2 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $800,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($800,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
