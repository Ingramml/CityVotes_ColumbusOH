    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with The Young Women's Christian Association, a not-for-profit Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3) entity, in an amount up to $30,000.00 to sponsor the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program exhibit, and to pay for expenses incurred before the purchase order was approved.  \n \nColumbus City Council passed Ordinance 2647-2022 to enter into a grant agreement with the YWCA of Columbus, in an amount up to $30,000.00 to sponsor the Undesign the Redline exhibition. This ordinance was then amended by Ordinance 0529-2023 to establish that costs from October 17, 2022 until the creation of the purchase order be eligible for reimbursement.  The grant agreement could not be executed before the Undesign the Redline exhibits were facilitated.  \n \nUndesign the Redline is a traveling educational exhibit that explores the history of structural racism and inequality, and how community development policies such as redlining, slum clearance, highway construction and others designed structural racism into American cities. The immersive exhibit creates a platform for Columbus residents to learn the history of these policies, interact with the stories of individuals and neighborhoods impacted, and invent the future of undoing structural inequities.\n \nAt the time of producing Ordinance 2467-2022 and 0529-2023, there was a miscommunication on the sponsorship amount that was requested.  Through its sponsorship of the exhibit, the City of Columbus not only provided sponsorship for the facilitation of  the Undesign the Redline exhibit at six locations in Columbus between October and December of 2022, but also the Columbus launch of the exhibit at the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program. Therefore, the sponsorship of the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program results in an additional request of up to $30,000.00 to sponsor the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program exhibit.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide up to $30,000.00 for costs already incurred to sponsor the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program exhibit.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this agreement is included in the Department of Development’s 2024 General Fund Budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The Young Women's Christian Association’s vendor number is 006086 and expires 1/9/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with The Young Women's Christian Association to sponsor the Activists and Agitators program exhibit; to authorize a transfer of $30,000.00 between object classes within the Administration Division; to authorize the expenditure of up to $30,000.00 from the 2024 General Fund Operating Budget; to pay for expenses incurred before the purchase order was approved, and to declare an emergency. ($30,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 2647-2022 to enter into a grant agreement with The Young Women's Christian Association, a not-for-profit Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3) entity, in an amount up to $30,000.00 to sponsor the Undesign the Redline exhibition; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0529-2023 to establish that costs from October 17, 2022 until the creation of the purchase order be eligible for reimbursement.  The grant agreement could not be executed before the Undesign the Redline exhibits were facilitated.  This amendment will ensure that these costs are reimbursable; and \n \nWHEREAS, the sponsorship of the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program results in an additional request of up to $30,000.00 to sponsor the YWCA’s Activists and Agitators program exhibit, and to pay for expenses incurred before the purchase order was approved.; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to approve this ordinance to prevent interruption in services, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with The Young Women's Christian Association, a not-for-profit IRC\n501(c)(3) entity, in an amount up to $30,000.00 to sponsor the Activists and Agitators program exhibit, and to pay for expenses incurred before the purchase order was approved which is hereby determined to be a valid public purpose.\n \nSECTION 2. That the transfer of $30,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within Fund 1000 (General Fund), from Dept-Div 44-01 (Administrative Division), object class 01 (Personnel) to Object Class 05 (Other) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $30,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 4401 (Administrative Division), in Object Class 05 (Other) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That this agreement is awarded in accordance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code related to grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5. Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements or agreement modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
