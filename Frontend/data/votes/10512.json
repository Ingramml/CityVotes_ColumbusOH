    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks on behalf of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA), to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University College of Social Work Age Friendly Innovation Center to conduct an evaluation into the efficacy and sustainability of the Shallow Rental Subsidy Pilot Program for the period of October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025.  \nIn July 2024, COAAA launched a pilot program providing shallow rental subsidies for case-managed clients across our eight-county Central Ohio region who spend more than 50% of their income on housing. A shallow rental subsidy provides less assistance than a federally funded deep rental subsidy but is more enduring than one-off emergency rental assistance. The rationale for this type of assistance is that some households consistently struggle financially but do not require the degree of assistance provided by a deep subsidy to achieve housing security. Further, deep rental subsidies are notoriously scarce, so shallow subsidies may represent a more cost-effective and flexible way for local governments and organizations to promote housing security among their constituents and clients. COAAA’s pilot program seeks to increase housing stability and well-being and reduce the need for emergency rental assistance among program participants. \nPrincipal Parties: \nThe Ohio State University College of Social Work\nMelanie Dheel, Chief Administration Officer\n1947 College Rd, Stillman Hall\nColumbus OH 43210\n614-247-2788\nFID: 31-6025986\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Total appropriation is $9,002.94 and is available within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department on behalf of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University College of Social Work, on behalf of Age-Friendly Innovation Center, to conduct an evaluation into the efficacy and sustainability of the Shallow Rental Subsidy Pilot Program; to authorize an expenditure of $9,002.94 within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.
