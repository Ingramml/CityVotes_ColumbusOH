    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nColumbus Public Health received additional grant carryover funds from fiscal year 2023, for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program, referenced in Ordinance No. 0441-2024. This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Knupp, Watson & Wallman, Inc. for  services that include HIV and other STI screening, PrEP education and referral, linkage to care for persons with HIV and/or an STI, and retention in HIV care. The term of the contract is June 1, 2024, through February 28, 2025, with funding based on service assessments for allowable services under the Ending the HIV Epidemic Grant program.  \n \nThis contract was originally set at a price point of $119,599.00, was modified by $280,401.00 via ordinance 2457-2024 using fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 carryover funds , and is being increased by $200,000.00 via fiscal year 2023 carryover funds for a new total amount of $600,000.00 via Ordinance 2678-2024 . This contract is being modified due to Columbus Public Health needing additional prevention services via media platforms to meet program needs. These services are outlined in an approved carryover budget. Furthermore, services are further expanded with Knupp, Watson & Wallman, Inc. to serve more EHE recipients and meet program deliverables with carryover funds from fiscal year 2023. This modification will allow the additional provision of outreach to build awareness and provide education regarding the importance of medical care and viral suppression, screening for persons at risk of HIV and making referrals for PrEP.  Knupp, Watson & Wallman, Inc. These services were competitively bid through vendor services (RFQ22658) and Bonfire (Sexual Health Outreach Campaign) in August of 2022, according to bidding requirements of the City Code. All price points included in this modification were established per service being delivered and reviewed in an approved budget. \n \nKnupp, Watson & Wallman, Inc. CC-029262: contract increased by $200,000.00 for a new total amount not to exceed $600,000.00 \n \nEmergency action is required to ensure the continued operation of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program. This is necessary to meet grant deliverables required by grantor and avoid risk of forfeiture of future funds.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThis contract is entirely funded by a grant award from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). This grant does not generate revenue nor require a city match.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Knupp, Watson & Wallman, Inc. for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program, for the provision of targeted media services for sexual transmitted infections prevention services for the period of June 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025; to authorize the expenditure of $200,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
