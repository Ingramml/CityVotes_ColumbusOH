    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: \n \nOrdinance 3278-2022 authorized CourtView Justice Solutions, Inc., d/b/a Equivant (“CourtView Justice Solution, Inc.”)  to implement the FedEx Portal and provide software upgrades necessary for the daily operations and the receipt of real time updates from FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) for the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (\"Municipal Court Clerk\"). \n \nOrdinance 2248-2023 authorized the City Auditor to transfer $200,000.00 and enter into a contract for the provision of commercial carrier service and allow the Municipal Court Clerk to enter into the program established by the Ohio Association of Municipal/County Court Clerks which allows courts to have exclusive pricing and service to aid in the delivery of court documents unmatched by the state term contract. The cost saving program utilizes the OneRate pricing program from FedEx. Through the implementation process, it was discovered by CourtView Justice Solution, Inc. that the OneRate pricing program needed to be added to the portal. Ordinance 1164-2024 authorized the program change to be implemented. \n \nOrdinance 1468-2024 authorized the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract with FedEx to add an additional pricing agreement. FedEx agreed to change the pricing agreement to allow the FedEx Portal to issue out FedEx mailers by the Two-Day Rate while the OneRate programming is being added. This allowed the Municipal Court Clerk to start offering commercial carrier service in August.  \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract with FedEx to waive the additional $1.00 fee that is being added to the Two-Day Rate shipments. FedEx has agreed to waive the $1.00 additional fee since they are offering us the OneRate pricing. This would allow commercial carrier service to continue to be issued at the agreed upon price. \n \nContract Compliance:  71-0427007\nExpiration Date: 7/19/2025\nDAX Vendor Number: 009933\n \nFiscal Impact:  No funds are required.\n \nEmergency:  There is an immediate need to modify the existing contract with FedEx for commercial carrier service to waive the additional $1.00 fee to ensure that the Municipal Court Clerk does not expend additional funds for the provision of commercial carrier service.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract with FedEx to waive the additional $1.00 fee that is being added to the Two-Day Rate shipments; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Municipal Court Clerk's Office has a need to modify the existing contract with FedEx services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the current contract with FedEx by to waive the additional $1.00 fee that is being added to the Two-Day Rate shipments to ensure that the Municipal Court Clerk does not expend additional funds for the provision of commercial carrier service, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Municipal Court Clerk is authorized and directed to modify the existing contract with FedEx to waive the additional $1.00 fee that is being added to the Two-Day Rate shipments for the provision of commercial carrier service for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office. \n \nSection 2.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure, which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approved by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
