    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into necessary administrative and maintenance and/or operations agreements with the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) relative to the Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad Corridor BRT project.\nIn 2019, the City of Columbus, acting through the Department of Public Service, and COTA formed a collaborative relationship for the purpose of facilitating the design and construction of certain public infrastructure improvements to accommodate predicted population growth in key regional growth corridors through denser development and coordinated investments in “high-capacity transit”.\n \nThe Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad Corridor BRT project, which is being administered by COTA, is a 9.3-mile mobility infrastructure project to improve transit service along the Broad Street corridor, consisting of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and up to seventeen (17) enhanced BRT stations between Rockbrook Crossing Avenue/Doherty Road and Washington Avenue, including segments off Broad Street along Cleveland Avenue, Long Street, and Washington Avenue. This effort is aligned with other City-led projects in the area.\nThe Department of Public Service and COTA mutually agree it is necessary for the parties to execute several agreements relative to the project outlining the obligations and responsibilities each will assume during the final design, right-of-way acquisition, construction, and post-construction phases of the aforementioned project. This legislation seeks to authorize to execution of the following agreements between the Department of Public Service and COTA: 1) a Memorandum of Agreement or a similar instrument, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary; 2) an infrastructure maintenance agreement to facilitate the upkeep of general improvements constructed or installed within the public right-of-way as part of the Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad Corridor BRT project; and 3) maintenance and operations agreements specifically concerning the Columbus Traffic Signal System (CTSS), the Transit Signal Priority (TSP) System, and the fiber optic components needed to support expansion of said systems. It also may be necessary for the Department of Public Service to waive certain permit application fees to facilitate the construction and maintenance of the planned public infrastructure improvements. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe encumbrance and expenditure of any capital or operating funds the Department of Public Service may need to fulfill the obligations and responsibilities undertaken pursuant to the agreements contemplated herein will be legislated separately. \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to facilitate the execution of the requisite Memorandum of Understanding by the parties on or about November 1, 2024, in order to maintain the project schedule established by COTA. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into necessary administrative and maintenance and/or operations agreements with the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) relative to the Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad Corridor BRT project, a 9.3-mile mobility infrastructure project to improve transit service along the Broad Street corridor; to authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to waive application fees for permits controlled by the Department of Public Service and applied for by COTA and/or its contractor relative to the Roadway - LinkUS - W Broad Corridor BRT project; and to declare an emergency.
