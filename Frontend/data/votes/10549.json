    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Pavement Protectors DBA M&D Blacktop Company for the Hard Surface Program 2024 - Phase 2 Project. The contract amount is $1,062,661.25, with alternates of $210,000.00 and a contingency of $120,000.00, for a total of $1,392,661.25 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nRecreation and Parks allocates a portion of the Capital Improvement Budget (CIB) to improve existing hard surfaces and accessibility every year. This project will construct sites designed as part of the annual hard surface improvements design package. The program focuses on the removal and replacement of existing asphalt and concrete surfaces that are highly used by the public, including parking lots, park drives, sport courts, and walkways.  These improvements ensure safe and easy access to parks and facilities. Areas for improvement are determined by requests from internal staff and the public. All requests are then assessed and given a Pavement Condition Rating (PCR), indicating a rank from 0, meaning worst condition, to 100, meaning best condition. Requests are then prioritized for action based on their respective PCR scores and feedback from relevant stakeholders. The anticipated project schedule will begin in the fall of 2024 and finish in the summer of 2025.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 30, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 20, 2024.
