    "description": "Explanation                     \n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify, renew and increase funding to an indefinite quantity contract with Watershed Organic Lawn Care for the Green Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance Project. The City of Columbus is committed to investing in green infrastructure. As part of this commitment, the City has built a number of bio-retention basins in the right-of-way and/or on City owned property.    \n \nA bioretention basin consists of a soil bed planted with vegetation located above a gravel layer with an underdrain. Stormwater runoff entering the bioretention facility is filtered first through the vegetation and then the soil bed before being conveyed downstream through the underdrain system, slowing the runoff velocity and treating stormwater runoff by absorption, decomposition, and filtration. Bioretention facilities are often sited adjacent to and used to treat runoff from paved surfaces such as parking lots. \n \nBioretention basins improve water quality through: soil and media filtration, stormwater detention, natural evapotranspiration, and biological uptake of water and nutrients. Stormwater can be conveyed to bioretention facilities via sheet flow, channelization, curb cuts, inlets or conveyance systems.\n \nThe City is currently responsible for the maintenance of 14 Facilities with 55 basins/wetlands and 24 swales in Group 1- Water and Regional Basins. These facilities are located at Idlewild Drive, Griggs Reservoir, O’Shaughnessy Reservoir, Hoover Reservoir, Dublin Road Water Plant, 910 Dublin Road Landscape, Briggs Road Detention, Crawford Farms Stormwater Retrofit, Mound Street Booster Station, Smokey Row Booster Station, and Joyce Avenue. Each facility and location may have multiple sites with basins, swales, or other types of green infrastructure. Additional facilities may be added in the future.  \n \nThe City is currently responsible for the maintenance of 11 facilities with 436 basins in Group 2- Urban Basins Type A. These facilities are located at Weisheimer Road, Overbook/Chatham, Schreyer-Springs,  Weisheimer-Indian Springs, Morse-Dominion, Blenheim-Glencoe Cooke/Glenmont, American Addition Phase I, Moler Road, Brentnell Avenue & Bar Harbor Road, American Addition Phase 2 & 3. Additional facilities may be added in the future. \n \nThe City is currently responsible for the maintenance of 8 facilities with 106 basins in Group 2- Urban Basins Type B. These facilities are located at Barthman Parsons, W. Town Street/U.S.62 DA, 2nd Street, River South Roadways W. Rich Street- Riversouth Street, W. Main Street Riversouth Street, W. Broad St. at Starling Street. Additional facilities may be added in the future.    \n \nWatershed Organic Lawn Care will coordinate with Stormwater and Regulatory Management Section (SRMS) staff when performing inspection and maintenance at the remaining basins.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities publicly opened three bids on June 10, 2020 and Watershed Organic Lawn Care was the lowest, responsive, responsible and best bidder. An indefinite quantity contract was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ015680 and authorized under Ordinance Number 1534-2020.\n \nThe first year of the indefinite quantity contract expires on August 31, 2021 and it is the intent of the Department of Public Utilities that this indefinite quantity contract renewal #1 and modification be for a period of one (1) year beginning September 1, 2021 through and including August 31, 2022. The contract language allows for the option to renew annually for two (2) additional one year periods based on mutual agreement, availability of budgeted funds and approval by City Council. Future modifications and renewals will be required to incorporate additional green infrastructures into this contract as facilities are constructed and turned over to the City for maintenance.  \n \nThis legislation seeks to modify, renew and add funding to the indefinite quantity contract.
