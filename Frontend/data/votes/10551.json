    "description": "Background\nThis ordinance modifies the service agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation originally authorized by ordinance 1268-2021 and modified by ordinances 3315-2021, 2279-2022, 2156-2023, and 3382-2023 for administration of the program providing exterior home repair to address code violations. Additionally, this ordinance authorizes entering into a service agreement with Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio as an additional service provider for the work listed above.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Office of the City Attorney and the Franklin County Environmental Courts have been working to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes that are in the court systems (and have been) since prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass. The homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs.  Their incomes are very limited. In July 2021, City Attorney Zach Klein’s office requested and received grant money in the amount of $100,000.00 to start the Home Repair Program. This work has primarily been carried out by NextGen who works with local contractors and encourages minority participation as much as possible.  All contractors are licensed, bonded, have BWC insurance and are registered with the City of Columbus as a contractor (in order to pull necessary permits, if needed, for repairs).  Once repairs are complete, the City Code Officer that referred the properties to the court system is contacted to make sure the repairs meet the requirements to close out the current code violations.\n \nThis ordinance adds $500,000.00 for the administration of the owner-occupied program providing exterior home repair to address code violations. The additional need could not be foreseen at the start of the program as we were not fully aware of the need in the community for these services. It has been determined that it is in the best interest to continue working with Columbus Next Gen to avoid any disruption in the owner-occupied exterior home repair program. The additional cost was based on previous expenditures. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes an extension of the original agreement with Columbus NextGen through December 31, 2025, enters into an agreement with Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio through December 31, 2025, and increases the available funding by $500,000.00 from the General Fund.\n \nColumbus Next Generation Corporation, CC#: CC008637, expires 5/30/2025\n \nHabitat for Humanity-MidOhio, CC#004859, expires 3/20/2025\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the General Fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify and extend an existing contract with Columbus Next Generation Corporation and to enter into a contact with Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $500,000.00 within the general fund Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund. ($500,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus Next Generation has been working with the City of Columbus Office of the City Attorney and the Franklin County Environmental Courts to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes; and\n \nWHEREAS, Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio is a trusted community partner who brings people together to inspire hope, build homes, empower families, and develop communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass; and\n \nWHEREAS, the homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
