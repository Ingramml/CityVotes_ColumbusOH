    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for the Sewer System Capacity Model (SSCM) Update 2020 project, CIP #650460-100002, in an amount up to $2,000,742.92.\n \nThe sewer collection system model developed and enhanced by the SSCM Update 2020 project is the principle tool used to manage the planning and operations of the City’s sewer collection system.  Enhancement of this tool is vital to minimizing sewer overflows and backups and thereby minimizing negative impacts to the environment caused by the City’s sewer system.  The continual updating of this model is also necessary to ensure compliance with the City’s consent orders with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  \n \nThe SSCM 2020 project enhances the City’s existing system-wide sewer collection models to support the Blueprint Columbus Program, operation & maintenance (O&M) of the collection system, operation of two Wastewater Treatment Plants, Capital Improvement Projects (CIPs), real time control initiatives (RTC) and sewer capacity evaluations.  The model must be updated as new data becomes available and new development occurs and to perform model runs and analyses as directed by the City.\n \nThis contract modification is needed to add funding to continue services.\n \nPlanning Area - “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $2,000,742.92\n             Original Contract                                           $1,733,099.16 (ORD 2214-2019; PO205359)\n                     Modification 1                                       $1,681,528.40 (ORD 1116-2021; PO281279)\n                     Modification 2                                       $2,000,163.59 (ORD 3041-2022; PO363008)\n                               Modification 3                                       $2,000,742.92 (This modification)\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                          $7,455,534.07 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original contract requires this project to serve the City for 6 years with four planned contract modifications to add funding to continue services.  This is one of the planned contract modifications.  Another procurement process is not required. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA funding needs estimate was established based upon the expected contract tasks and an estimate of the cost of the tasks as determined by existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe collection system model, enhanced by the Model Update 2020 Project, is the principle tool used to manage the planning and operations of the City’s sewer collection system.  Enhancement of this tool is vital to minimizing sewer overflows and backups and thereby minimizing negative impacts to the environment caused by the City’s sewer system.  This contract is also a major component of City’s Blueprint Columbus Integrated Plan program. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nArcadis US, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC009409 and expires 2/22/25.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Arcadis US, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Arcadis US, Inc. plans to use three City-certified MBE/WBE sub-consultants on this project for a total spend of $43,892.40, or about 2.2% of the work.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Arcadis US, Inc., has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nDLZ Ohio, Inc.                                            Columbus, Ohio                                    MBE \nAECOM Technical Services, Inc.                 Columbus, Ohio                                    MAJ\nCDM Smith, Inc.                                         Columbus, Ohio                                    MAJ\nHA-m Consultants Corp.                              Powell, Ohio                                        MAJ\nBurgess & Niple, Inc.                                  Columbus, Ohio                                    MAJ\n \nThe certification of Arcadis US, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the of this contract modification.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated for this expenditure within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109.
