    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing contract with JadeTrak LLC. for the GreenSpot Program Metrics Platform. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $20,000.00.\n \nThe GreenSpot program platform has over 23,000 members throughout the City of Columbus and the surrounding areas. Each member has an individualized dashboard to track their sustainability progress on the GreenSpot platform. JadeTrack provides the GreenSpot program with the technology and engagement tools to empower residents and businesses to track the effect of their sustainability efforts. The Department of Public Utilities has determined that it is in the best interest of the City to continue these services with JadeTrack instead of awarding and designing a new platform through other procurement processes. JadeTrack is the creator and owner of the GreenSpot platform and has the experience to continue providing this service to the residents of the City of Columbus. Additionally, due to the expected costs of implementing a new software platform that matches JadeTrack’s specialized offerings, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a contract modification with JadeTrack LLC.\n \nThe need for additional services were planned for at the time of the initial contract because JadeTrack is the sole owner of the GreenSpot platform. This second modification will extend the contract to and including November 30, 2025. This modification will include website design changes that update the GreenSpot platform with new items, modifications to individual dashboards, the sign-up process, and eDashboards. It will also cover the general maintenance and housing of GreenSpot data. The annual subscription price is established by JadeTrack and fluctuates slightly from year to year.    \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nJadeTrack LLC\n6100 Emerald Parkway\nDublin, Ohio 43016\nMatt Castro, (614) 323-6126                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number: 023497\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: 10/16/2025\n \nFiscal Impact: $20,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Public Utilities Operating Funds to meet the financial obligations of this contract.  \n$00.00 was spent in 2023\n$19,500.00 was spent in 2022\n$19,500.00 was spent in 2021\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification and extension with JadeTrack LLC for the GreenSpot  Program Metrics Platform; to authorize the expenditure of $20,000.00 split between the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code.
