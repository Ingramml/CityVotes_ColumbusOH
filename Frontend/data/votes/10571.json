    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish multiple Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to purchase City Vehicle Upfits with Ace Truck Body Inc., Rose Karl Erich (dba K.E. Rose Company), and Messer Work Van Solutions. These contracts will be used by multiple City agencies, including but not limited to the Division of Fleet Management, and the Departments of Public Utilities, Public Service, and Recreation and Parks, for vehicle upfits required for daily operations. The term of the proposed option contracts would be approximately three (3) years, expiring December 31, 2027, with the option to renew for one (1) additional year. In addition, the expenditure of $3.00 is hereby authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002726.\n                     \nA formal best value proposal (BVP) solicitation was published for the purchase of City Vehicle Upfits.\n \nProposals were evaluated by a five (5) member committee, based upon various criteria including quality and feasibility, past performance, specification conformity, schedule and delivery, and acquisition cost, resulting in an award recommendation of multiple contracts to Ace Truck Body Inc., Rose Karl Erich (dba K.E. Rose Company), and Messer Work Van Solutions. \n \nBID INFORMATION: Request for Quotation RFQ028017 was advertised and proposals were opened on August 1, 2024. Three (3) responses were received. In the project specifications, the City’s vehicle upfit needs were broken down into 3 main categories:\n \n1)                     Cab and Chassis and Cut-Away Vans\n2)                     Light Duty Pickup Trucks up to 1-Ton Trucks\n3)                     Vans, Cars, and SUVs\n \nAn evaluation committee consisting of one (1) member of the Division of Fleet Management, two (2) members of the Department of Public Service, and two (2) members of the Department of Public Utilities provided technical expertise. Each member of the committee scored and ranked written proposals submitted by the offerors. After evaluating all proposals, a request for BAFO (Best and Final Offer) was requested from all three responding vendors. \n \nBased upon the City’s anticipated annual quantity of upfits across all three categories of vehicles, the evaluation committee doesn’t anticipate that any single vendor can adequately and timely handle the City’s projected volume of necessary vehicle upfits. Upon review and in compliance with Columbus City Code 329, the committee submitted final rankings and recommends awarding multiple contracts to the overall most responsive, responsible, and best bidders based on best value to the City:\n \nCategory 1: Cab and Chassis and Cut-Away Vans - award to Ace Truck Body Inc. and K.E. Rose Company\nCategory 2: Light Duty Pickup Trucks up to 1-Ton Trucks - award to Ace Truck Body Inc., K.E. Rose Company, and Messer Work Van Solutions\nCategory 3: Vans, Cars, and SUVs - award to K.E. Rose Company and Messer Work Van Solutions\n \nTotal Estimated Annual Expenditure across all contracts: $1,550,000.00, various City agencies\n \nAce Truck Body Inc., CC# CC-004484 expires 8/9/2025, Items 1 and 2, $1.00\n \nRose Karl Erich dba K.E.
