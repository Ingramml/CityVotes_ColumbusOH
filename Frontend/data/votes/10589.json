    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify existing contracts, identified as purchase orders PO360267 and PO410978, with Ohio Machinery Co. for the purchase of seven chipper trucks. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $17,500.00. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department is in the process of purchasing seven chipper trucks for the Forestry Section. Forestry staff has requested a change order to the specifications for these chipper trucks awarded to Ohio Machinery Co. on PO360267 and PO410978. This change order will provide a larger, more powerful hoist to lift the chipper truck body for all seven trucks. The cost of this upgraded hoist is 2,500.00 per truck, or $17,500.00 total for all seven trucks.\n \nThis modification is needed due to a mistake made in preparation of the specifications for procurement. All parties involved, including the Recreation and Parks Department, Fleet Management, and the awarded vendor, failed to recognize the need for a more powerful hoist on these dump truck beds. The staff operators reported the issue once the trucks were put into service.  The vendor agreed that they would not charge any fees for labor to replace the existing hoists once the difference in price for the larger hoists was paid, that being $2,500 per truck, or $17,500.00 total for all seven trucks. Due to this and the fact that the trucks were already awarded to this vendor and were already in service, this modification is necessary. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Machinery Co.\n3993 East Royalton Road\nBroadview Heights, Ohio 44147                                                      \nJohn Krauss, (614) 875-3732\nContract Compliance Number: 006428\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 08, 2026\n \nBenefits to the Public: Trees and parkland maintained by the city enhance the quality of life of our citizens.
