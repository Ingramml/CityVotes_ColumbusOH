    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the W.E. Upjohn Unemployment Trustee Corporation (“Upjohn”) by extending the contract.\n \nOriginal Agreement                                                               $100,000.00                                          Ord. 2905-2023\nModification No. 1                                                               $          0.00                     \nTotal Agreement Amount                     $100,000.00\n \nOn October 30, 2023, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 2905-2023 which authorized the Office of Education to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the W.E. Upjohn Unemployment Trustee Corporation (\"Upjohn\"), a non-profit corporation, for evaluation of the Columbus Promise program. \n \nThe contract authorized in 2023 expires on October 30, 2024. This contract extension will extend to February 28, 2025. The modification will allow Upjohn to continue the ongoing work of evaluating previous Promise cohorts and advise on upcoming strategic decisions. Evaluation under this contract is ongoing and funds have not been exhausted as of October 2024. This contract modification will allow for the continuation of the evaluation without interruption. Upjohn has served as the evaluation partner for the Promise Program since its inception, and closing and/or rebidding this contract at this time would be detrimental to the ongoing research and strategic evaluation of the program's successes and opportunities.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the contract modification to be executed prior to the contract’s expiration.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the W.E. Upjohn Unemployment Trustee Corporation (“Upjohn”) by extending the contract; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2905-2023 was passed by Columbus City Council in October 2023, authorizing a contract with the W.E. Upjohn Unemployment Trustee Corporation for evaluation of the Columbus Promise Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Education seeks to extend the contract to allow for ongoing evaluation of the previous Promise cohort and advise on upcoming strategic decisions within the existing scope of service; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify this contract in order to extend the contract before it expires on October 30, 2024 and continue evaluation of the Columbus Promise program, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THERFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Office of Education is hereby authorized to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the W.E. Upjohn Unemployment Trustee Corporation (“Upjohn”) by extending the contract to February 28, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
