    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the construction contract with Lehnert Farms/Bolton Field Construction Project, Mod #1, for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section, Project No. 610788-100000.\n \nThis project involves stormwater system improvements to the Lehnert Farm detention basin. This includes installing approximately 515’ of 36” storm sewer and 535’ of 42” storm sewer along Norton and Georgesville Roads respectively. This project also involves significant modifications to the existing basin which will provide water quality benefits and improvements to maintenance access.\nPlanning area is “52 - Westland”.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $176,188.48\nOriginal Contract Amount: $1,590,208.15 (PO 248054)\nModification No. 1 (current): $ 176,188.48\nTotal (Orig. + Mod. 1) $1,766,396.63\n \nReasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThe general contractor Facemyer Landscaping LLC encountered existing conditions that were different and significantly worse than was anticipated and identified in the contract documents. The contractor has encountered concealed conditions which will require more extensive demolition and reconstruction than was anticipated or included in the contract documents. The original contract contingency is insufficient to pay for changes that have been identified for the remaining project work. The funds requested for this contract modification will cover the costs of this previously unanticipated work.\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe work included in this modification is an essential part of the work currently being performed in the original contract. This modification keeps the contractor on schedule to finalize the Lehnert Farms/Bolton Field Construction Project during the 2021 construction season without the need to extend the project into the next calendar year. The additional cost, risk and liability associated with bidding out this work would well exceed any benefit. The work was not anticipated at the time of bid and is determined to be necessary to properly complete elements of work underway on this project.\n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nWith the assistance of the City Project Manager the Design Professional prepared a Request for Proposal document for the additional work. The Contractor responded to this request with a cost proposal for the services. The City Project Manager and the Design Professional reviewed the Contractor’s cost proposal and negotiated a cost to perform this work.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: 31-1757841 (expires 3/31/23, WBE, DAX #005926)\nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Facemyer Landscaping LLC.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is requested for this legislation. Justification: Additional storm sewer work has been identified which was not known at the time of bidding but is critical to the storm sewer system infrastructure.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The project provides economic impacts by reducing street, property and structural flooding from the existing stormwater detention basin by installing a secondary outlet. Additionally, environmental benefits will be provided from structural modifications and aquatic plantings to the basin which improve water quality.A transfer of funds within the Storm Sewer Bond Fund 6204 is necessary as well as an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the construction contract with Facemyer Landscaping LLC, in the amount of $176,188.48, for additional work needed along Norton and Georgesville Roads for the Lehnert Farms/Bolton Field Construction Project, Division of Sewerage & Drainage, Stormwater Section; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $176,188.48 within the Storm Sewer Bond Fund 6204; to amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget, and to declare an emergency.
