    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the unplanned modification of a contract with the Gertrude Wood Community Foundation, the appropriation and expenditure of funds in an amount up to $10,401.00 of  the 2023 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, restrictive covenant, and authorizes the city to act as a lender for this project with the Gertrude Wood Community Foundation. The project is to develop and construct a single housing unit at 877 Miller Avenue that was recently purchased from the City of Columbus Land Bank.\n \n \nOriginal Agreement                     $   260,132.00                      Ord. 0361-2024                      PO439577\nModification No. 1                     $     10,401.00\nTotal                                                               $   270,533.00\n \n \nOrdinance 0361-2024, approved by City Council on March 6, 2024, authorized the Director of Development to support the development of the single housing unit at 877 Miller Avenue in an amount of up to $260,132.00.  This legislation represents an additional amount up to $10,401.00 for a total amount up to $270,533.00.  The need for the additional HOME funding is due to the post construction appraisal was valued higher than anticipated thus creating a larger affordability gap and the additional need of funding to close that gap.   \nThe funding of this project will address the need for affordable housing in the City of Columbus for low-income families that are at or below 80% of the Area Median Income limits set by HUD.  This project will add decent, safe and sanitary housing to the Driving Park Neighborhood, located on the Southside of Columbus.  The increased availability of safe and stable housing in Columbus promotes the health and well-being of the neighborhood and the citizens living in the neighborhood. \nWe are funding this project with the Gertrude Wood Community Foundation, who is a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) in partnership with the City of Columbus.  Gertrude Wood Community Foundation will use 2023 HOME CHDO set-aside ($92,369.00) and HOME Entitlement ($178,164.00) funds to develop the 877 Miller Avenue project on land purchased from the Land Bank. \nGertrude Wood Community Foundation was founded in 2005 with the mission to empower the Driving Park area by bringing new housing opportunities to the neighborhood, as well as other supportive services that promote a safer and healthier neighborhood for the residents. \n \nWith the construction of a new, modular, single-family home at 877 Miller Avenue, the Gertrude Wood Community Foundation is investing in and providing affordable housing to the Driving Park neighborhood.  The Unibuilt modular home will consist of three bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms, a basement and a parking pad, and will be built to City AWARE standards.  The home will be sold to a first-time homebuyer earning at or below 80% of the Area Median Income as defined by HUD.  \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2023 Action Plan per ordinance 3353-2022. \n \nEmergency Designation:  An emergency exists as this gap in funding due to the appraisal prevents the closing on this house.  The more time that this home sits vacant the possibility of vandalism increases and the future homeowner could face further financial hardships for not closing on the property timely.  \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 008062 and expires 6/23/2025.\n \nFiscal Impact: $260,132.00 is available from the 2023 HOME grant (G442202) using HOME CHDO Set-aside funds.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the unplanned modification of the contract with Gertrude Wood Community Foundation; to authorize the additional appropriation and expenditure of up to $10,401.00 of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement 2023 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, restrictive covenant, and authorizes the city to act as a lender for this project with the Gertrude Wood Community Foundation to construct a single family home; and to declare emergency. ($10,401.00).\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is a participating jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is the recipient of HOME Investment Partnerships funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus City Council has approved the 2023 Action Plan per ordinance 3353-2022 and approved the initial funding of this project via Ordinance 0361-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development desires to support the Gertrude Wood Community Foundation with financial support for a single family home at 877 Miller Avenue; and\n \nWHEREAS, the post construction appraisal created a larger gap in affordability therefore additional funding was needed for this project in an amount up to $10,401.00 bringing the overall total for this project to be in an amount up to $270,533.00\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that this home is ready to close and the gap in funding is preventing this from happening.  This gap was unforeseen due to the appraisal being much higher.  The more time that this home sits vacant the possibility of vandalism increases and the future homeowner could face further financial hardships for not closing on the property.  Thereby allowing this as an emergency prevents possible vandalism to the home and prevents any undue hardships on the future homeowner thereby preserving the public, health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and  NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
