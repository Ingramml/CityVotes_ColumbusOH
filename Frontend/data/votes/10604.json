    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People, a non profit entity, for the support of their ID for All People Program.\n \nMillions of Americans do not have the proper forms of identification to access life’s necessities. Lack of ID, such as birth certificates, state identification cards and driver’s licenses, and social security cards jeopardizes access to employment, housing, food, healthcare, banking, education, and voting.\n \nLack of ID is most pronounced among seniors, people of color, domestic violence survivors, and those who are homeless, returning from incarceration, or living in poverty. These populations are also less likely to be able to afford access to the forms of identification they need. That is, residents’ financial constraints prevent them from obtaining documents that are themselves necessary for access to economic security.\n \nCommunity Development for All people began a program in 2019 to remove the financial barrier standing between residents on the South Side and the identification they need by providing bus passes and vouchers for residents to receive their Ohio state IDs, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates. In 2019, the program demonstrated it was helping residents access resources that are the basis of economic wellbeing: 29 percent of participants utilized the program for employment, 21 percent for housing, 17 percent for their children, and 10 percent to be able to access social services. \n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure funding is available immediately for residents who without proper identifications cannot register children for school, get a job or an apartment, or apply for governmental assistance.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People in support of their ID for All People Program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, possession of personal identification documents impacts residents’ quality of life and improves their ability to be productive members of their community; and\n \nWHEREAS, lack of identification hinders access to basic resources such as employment, housing, banking, and education and perpetuates the cycle of poverty; and\n \nWHEREAS, lack of identification is an acute problem for vulnerable populations in Columbus, such as seniors, domestic violence survivors, and those who are homeless, returning from incarceration, and living in poverty; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is counter to the public good to allow financial barriers to prevent residents’ access to personal identification documents, which are themselves vital for securing economic prosperity; and\n \nWHEREAS, the cost of some forms of identification, especially birth certificates, puts them out of reach for residents who need them most and is due largely to the excessive fees placed upon them by the State of Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, the ID for All People program housed within Community Development for All People allows residents to apply for assistance to obtain personal identification documents and requires additional funds to meet the high demand from the public; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People for the support of their ID for All People Program in time to allow residents to obtain identification who without proper identifications cannot register children for school, get a job or an apartment, or apply for governmental assistance, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the not-for-profit Community Development for All People in support of their ID for All People Program.\n \nSECTION 2. That the appropriation and expenditure of $50,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reason stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
