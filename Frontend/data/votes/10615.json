The Contractor is responsible for professional management of the Land Application of Biosolids with Regional Storage program, which generally includes preparing site authorization requests, samples, daily activity reports, weekly progress reports, invoices and submitting this information to the City’s Project Manager. The contract is utilized by the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant, Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant and the Compost Facility.\n \nPROCUREMENT\nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids for the Class B Liquid Biosolids Land Application Program in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 (RFQ022645). A contract was established and authorized under Ordinance #0114-2023.\nCONTRACT AMOUNTS / TIMELINE\nThe contract term was for one (1) year from the date of execution. Ordinance No. 0464-2024 extended the underlying contract through July 31, 2025.  The contract language allowed for five (5) one (1) year renewal options on a year to year basis upon mutual agreement, availability of funds, and approval by Columbus City Council. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.  We are currently in the second year of a six year contract.\n \nThis legislation seeks to modify the contracts to add funding to provide for services through the term of the contract. This Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications. \n \nCost summary: \nOriginal Contract, Ordinance #0114-2023                                                                $800,000.00\nModification #1, Ordinance #2043-2023                                                                     $562,515.00\nModification /Renewal#2, Ordinance #0464-2024                                         $600,000.00\nModification #3, Ordinance #2586-2024 (pending)                                                 $300,000.00\n \nEstimated Contract Total:                                                                                               $2,262,515.00\n \n1.                      Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for the contract is $300,000.00.  Total contract amount including this modification is $2,262,515.00.\n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen: Funding is added on an incremental basis to provide for services.
