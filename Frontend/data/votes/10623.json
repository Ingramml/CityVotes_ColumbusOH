    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Brown and Caldwell for the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project, CIP #650886-100000, in an amount up to $76,047.20.\n \nThe purpose of this project is to provide structural modification to West Columbus Local Protection Project (WCLPP) hydraulic components to improve the overall operation of key components of the WCLPP during Scioto River flood events.  Work includes specialized engineering investigations; making recommendations; performing detailed engineering calculations; performing Large Diameter Sewer Condition Assessment of the Scioto Main Trunk Sewer; preparing construction plans and specifications for the rehabilitation of Scioto Main Trunk Sewer manholes to provide localized protection to mitigate water in basement (WIB) occurrences at previously identified locations; and designing and preparing detailed plans and specifications.  \nThe consultants have completed the field survey and the condition assessment, and submitted their recommendation to rehab the Scioto Main Sewer-Middle section and to modify the design of the McKinley overflow structure.  Future work includes preparing the construction plans and specifications, easement documents, bidding documents, and consultant services during construction. \n \nThe Scioto Main Trunk Sewer- Middle section begins at Griggs Reservoir and continues south to West Broad Street, a distance of approximately 26,000 feet of 84 inch and 90 inch sanitary sewer.  The general project boundary is the middle section of the Scioto Main Trunk Sewer and tributary sewers starting just south of Griggs Dam and then proceeding in a southerly direction to West Broad Street.  \n \nIn November 2017, Brown and Caldwell (BC) submitted the preliminary design for the Scioto Main Middle Section.  The 2017 recommendations aimed to protect the system from the over 30 feet of internal hydraulic pressure caused by closing the RPFCS sluice gate. This was necessary to maintain the integrity of the Franklinton Floodwall during a 25-year flood event on the Scioto River.  BC advanced the design to a 50% completion level for these comprehensive improvements before the project was paused.  The pause allowed the City to conduct additional analysis on the system and surrounding areas.\n \nIn December 2022, the City revised the project scope and BC updated the recommended improvements to reflect these changes. These updated recommendations will replace the 2017 recommendations. The design will be updated accordingly. Due to these significant updates and additional work, we need to modify the contract and request additional funding in the amount of $76,047.20 to accomplish the revised work.\n \nThe Community Area for this project is 99 - Citywide.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $76,047.20\nCost summary: \nOriginal Engineering Agreement   (ORD 1651-2015; EL017473)            $1,792,224.98\nModification No.1                        (ORD 0467-2018)                                         $0.00 \nProposed Modification No. 2        (current)                                                $76,047.20\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                         $1,868,272.18\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bidding the project will likely result in higher costs, as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by a new consultant unless the same consultant wins the new RFP. In such a case, we would have lost significant time in acquiring and evaluating new proposals without substantial benefit.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by Brown and Caldwell, based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe City previously commissioned a field inspection and report on the condition of numerous manholes on the Scioto Main trunk sanitary sewer and related tributary sewers.  The final report indicated many manholes are structurally deficient and cannot withstand surcharge above their corresponding top of casting elevation.  The surcharging of the manholes is necessary for the successful activation of the McKinley Avenue overflow structure which protects West Columbus from surface flooding.  This manhole deficiency prevents the City of Columbus from completing certain phases of the US Army Corps of Engineers approved protection plan for the West Columbus Local Protection Project (WCLPP) during Scioto River flood events.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nBrown and Caldwell’s contract compliance number is CC010815 and expires 10/10/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Brown and Caldwell is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  As part of their proposal, Brown and Caldwell has proposed no subcontractors to perform contract work.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 0.0%.\n \nThe certification of Brown and Caldwell was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the December Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to show the actual loan amount.\n \nFunds will need to be appropriated and expended in the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124.\n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Brown and Caldwell for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Brown and Caldwell and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Brown and Caldwell for the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to appropriate funds in the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; to make this ordinance contingent upon the Ohio Water Development Authority approving a loan for this project; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $76,047.20 from the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund to pay for the contract modification.  ($76,047.20)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. EL017473 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1651-2015, for the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, the project scope was revised requiring a change in contract work to be performed for the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to execute a contract modification to the professional engineering services agreement with Brown and Caldwell for the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project for detailed design and bidding services; and \n \nWHEREAS, City Council authorized this contract modification to be funded via a loan from the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved; and\n \nWHEREAS, the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget must be modified to align budget authority with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds will need to be appropriated in the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds from the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124 to pay for services provided by this contract modification; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget authorized by Ordinance 1907-2024 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority/ Revised Authority / Change \n6124 / 650886-100000 / Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project (OWDA Direct Loan) / $0 / $76,047 / $76,047 (To match loan amount)\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the sum of $76,047.20 is appropriated in Fund 6124 (Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund), per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify and increase the professional engineering services contract with Brown and Caldwell, 445 Hutchinson Ave, Suite 540, Columbus, OH 43235, for the Scioto Main Sanitary Pump Stations Project, in an amount up to $76,047.20.\n \nSECTION 4.  That an expenditure of $76,047.20, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized to pay for this contract per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  This ordinance is contingent upon the Ohio Water Development Authority's Board approving the loan for this project.\n \nSECTION 6.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 7.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 8.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 9.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
