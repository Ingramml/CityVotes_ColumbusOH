    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to execute a planned contract modification to increase funding for the professional engineering services contract with CDM Smith, Inc., for the Southerly Plant Wide Control System Improvements project, CIP #650378-100001, in an amount up to $3,894,000.00. \n \nThe Division of Sewerage and Drainage completed an evaluation of programmable logic controllers and monitoring equipment at both the Jackson Pike and Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTP) between March 2019 and May 2021. The evaluation identified control systems and components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturer and repair parts are difficult to acquire. \n \nAn RFP was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from 11/7/22 through 12/2/22 to select a company to design replacements for the antiquated control and monitoring systems and equipment identified throughout the Southerly WWTP.  Funding was provided to analyze alternatives and perform preliminary engineering for the replacements.  This phase has been completed.    \n \nThe second phase (this modification) of the contract will perform detailed design engineering and develop biddable plans based on the decisions made in the first phase of the contract.  \n \nThe Community Planning Area for this project is 99-Citywide\n \n1.1 Future Modifications:  The future anticipated needs below are for engineering services during construction.  The purchase of equipment and construction will be funded through a separate contract and are not included below.\n   \n1.2 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $3,894,000.00.\n \nCost summary: \nOriginal Contract, Preliminary Design                           $                     917,700.00 (ORD 0637-2023; PO379679)\nModification 1 (current)                                                                    $   3,894,000.00\nModification 2 (future)                                                                    $   4,000,000.00\n \nEstimated Contract Total                                              $   8,811,700.00\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  This contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4. How the cost of modification was determined:  The cost proposal was provided by CDM Smith Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage, and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.  The fees in the proposal are based upon contract pricing already established for job titles, tasks, and allowable expenses for the contract.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project improves security of our wastewater treatment plant that ultimately protects the Scioto River. This project will improve employee safety and reduce risk of environmental impacts from malevolent acts against City facilities. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nCDM Smith Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-000180 and expires 10/7/24.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was awarded with a 15.0% diversity goal that was approved by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and bid documents for this contract.\nAs part of their proposal, CDM Smith Inc. has proposed using the following sub-consultants to perform contract work:\nCompany Name                                                     City/State                                     ODI Cert.
