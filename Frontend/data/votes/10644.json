    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract with Synagro Central, LLC, through the City’s Invitation For Bid process, to provide ongoing residuals removal services for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project, CIP #690566-100001, in an initial amount up to $5,000,000.00.  The contract is expected to last up to four and a half years and cost $41,379,583.30.  \n \nWater residuals are the byproduct of treating raw water to create safe drinking water.  Residuals are created when chemicals react with suspended solids in the raw water.  Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) of the Clean Water Act, the entity that creates the residuals is responsible for safely and responsibly storing and disposing them.  At PAWP, these residuals are stored in lagoons until disposal is needed.  Periodically, approximately every 12 to 15 years, Lagoon 3 nears its residual storage capacity and must be emptied both to continue as a residuals storage facility and to prevent a discharge of these materials back into the environment.  \n \nThe purpose of the PAWP Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project is to provide services to remove, transport, and dispose of the water treatment residuals and grit-laden material from Lagoon 3.  Some of these materials will be disposed of in a beneficial reuse manner as fertilizer or compost, while some of the materials will be taken to landfills for disposal.  This disposal preserves the existing lagoon to continue to be used for residual storage.  The cost of emptying Lagoon 3 of residuals is much less than it would cost to buy new land and build another residuals storage lagoon.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE\nAll work shall be substantially complete within 1580 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed, with the Final Completion to occur within 1610 calendar days.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed in fourth quarter 2024.  The first stage of this contract (Start-up) is expected to last through March 2025 and is being funded for $5,000,000.  The contract is subject to annual funding approval by Columbus City Council for the remaining four years of the service.  The Department of Public Utilities anticipates funding the remainder of the work in three contract funding modifications of $12,000,000.00 to $13,000,000.00 each.    \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT\nThe bid amount and proposed award amount is $41,379,583.30, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract (Start-Up Phase)                                                   $5,000,000.00                                          \n                     Contract Modification 1 (future)                                                             $12,379,583.00\n        Contract Modification 2 (future)                        $12,000,000.00\n        Contract Modification 3 (future)                        $12,000,000.00\n        CONTRACT TOTAL                                                             $41,379,583.30                                          \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe removal of residuals from Lagoon 3 will provide additional storage for residuals generated by the Parsons Avenue Water Plant. This added capacity helps reduce the City’s risk of an NPDES violation caused from discharges from the lagoons containing residuals, and is considerably less expensive than buying land and building a new storage lagoon.  There are no anticipated public meetings during this project. The Division of Water will be responsible for coordinating with stakeholders. \n \n3.  SERVICES CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from April 18, 2024 through June 5, 2024.  Two bids were received for the project and opened on June 5, 2024.  The following companies submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                          Bid Amount                        City/State                    ODI Status\nSynagro Central, LLC                          $41,379,583.30                     Baltimore, MD                     MAJ\nWM National Services, Inc.                          $54,103,104.31                     Houston, TX                        MAJ\n \nThe Synagro Central, LLC 's bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $41,379,583.30.\n \nThe certification of Synagro Central, LLC was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nSynagro Central, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC010213 and expires 5/23/26.   \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 20% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After review of the submitted diversity paperwork, ODI has approved a goal of 2.9% for this project.
