    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to extend an existing agreement with Hansen Banner, LLC through extension of purchase order PO436197 through March 26, 2026; and to authorize the use of any remaining funds/unspent existing on purchase order PO436197. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Technology (DoT) to extend an existing agreement with Hansen Banner, LLC through extension of purchase order PO436197. There are no additional funds associated with this extension, rather, the extension makes the remaining funds on the above-named purchase order available for an additional year.\n \nOn March 18, 2024, Ordinance 0608-2024 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Hansen Banner, LLC for professional services associated with the Hansen CIS system. At this time, there are funds available on the purchase order that DoT does not anticipate spending prior to the expiration of the purchase order on March 26, 2025. Thus, this ordinance extends the purchase order expiration date for one year, to March 25, 2026.\n \nCity Codes section 329.09(a) requires that the following information be provided to modify an existing contract:\n1.                     Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification - No additional funds are required as part of this modification. Rather, the remaining funds on purchase order PO436197 will be available for an additional year.\n2.                     Why the need for additional funds to be expended was not foreseen at the time the contract was awarded - There is no change to the dollar amount of the contract. Delays in the project require that the initial contract award be made available for an additional year.\n3.                     Why it is not in the City’s best interest to award additional contract requirements through other procurement processes - The above-described extension is part of an existing and on-going project. To bring in a new vendor in the middle of a project would be disruptive to it.\n4.                     How the price for additional goods or services was determined - There are no additional funds associated with this request.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nNo additional funds are associated with this ordinance.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: Hansen Banner, LLC, #008834, expires 7-3-2026\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to extend an existing agreement with Hansen Banner, LLC through extension of purchase order PO436197 through March 26, 2026; and to authorize the use of any remaining funds/unspent existing on purchase order PO436197. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, on May 18, 2024, Ordinance 0608-2024 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology to enter in an agreement with Hansen Banner, LLC for professional services associated with the Hansen CIS system; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Technology desires to extend this agreement through extension of purchase order PO436197 through March 25, 2026; and\n \nWHEREAS, this extension will make available any remaining funds/unspent balance on purchase order PO436197; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the extension of PO436197 through March 25, 2026 to make remaining funds available on the aforementioned PO through that date for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety; NOW THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Technology be and is hereby authorized to extend an existing agreement with Hansen Banner, LLC through extension of purchase order PO436197.\n \nSECTION 2. That the extension of purchase order PO436197 through March 25, 2026 is hereby authorized.\n \nSECTION 3. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or all contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
