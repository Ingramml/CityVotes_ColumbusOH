    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  By Ordinance Nos. 2446-2003, 0451-2004, and 1007-2004, City Council, as the “organizational board of commissioners,” determined a petition for a new community authority filed with the Clerk of City Council by Downtown Columbus, Inc., formerly Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, (the “Developer”) was sufficient and established the RiverSouth Authority (the “Authority”) pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 349 to support the redevelopment of several square blocks in downtown Columbus generally bounded by Town Street and State Street on the north, High Street and Wall Street on the east, Rich Street and Cherry Street on the south, and Front Street and Ludlow Street on the west (the “District”). In partnership with the City to implement the 2022 Downtown Columbus Strategic Plan adopted by City Council pursuant to Resolution No. 0164X-2022, the Developer is currently planning new financing, land acquisition, land development, and community facilities in downtown Columbus. By Resolution Nos. 0018X-2023, 0034X-2023, and 0046X-2023, the District was expanded by a first amendment to petition to include three additional non-adjacent properties located near the following intersections: Long Street and Wall Street, Gay Street and Front Street, and Walnut Street and Washington Avenue.  \n \nTo further implement the 2022 Downtown Columbus Strategic Plan, the Developer now seeks to add to the District certain additional properties it owns or controls. On or about October 23, 2024, the Developer submitted to the Clerk of City Council a second amendment to petition (the “Second Amendment”) to add the Developer’s additional properties to the District. City Council is now required by Ohio Revised Code Chapter 349 to determine the sufficiency of the Second Amendment, authorize public notices, and fix a time and place for a public hearing on the Second Amendment for the additional properties. City Council in this Resolution also authorizes the City’s Director of the Department of Development, or his or her authorized designee, to publish a public notice of the time and place for the public hearing regarding this proposed Second Amendment; to hold the required hearing on the Second Amendment; and to forthwith certify to City Council that the hearing was held as advertised. \n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in order to provide notice in a newspaper for three weeks prior to the public hearing and set the public hearing date within 30-45 days of the date after the Second Amendment was filed with the City Clerk in accordance with the requirements of Ohio Revise Code Chapter 349.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo determine that the Second Amendment to Petition for Organization of a New Community Authority that provides for the addition of certain developer-owned or controlled property to the new community district of the RiverSouth Authority is sufficient and complies with the requirements of Chapter 349 of the Ohio Revised Code; to set the time and place for a public hearing on the Second Amendment; to authorize the notice of such public hearing by publication in a newspaper for three consecutive weeks; and to declare an emergency.
