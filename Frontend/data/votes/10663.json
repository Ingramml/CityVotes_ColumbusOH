    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with and to reimburse the Franklin County Engineer’s Office for work performed during the design phase to the Bikeway - Dublin Rd - Quarry Trails to Limestone Ridge Dr project.\nThe aforementioned effort, which is being administered by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office, will culminate in the installation of a shared use path along the Dublin Road Corridor from Quarry Trails Metro Park to Limestone Ridge Drive. A portion of the shared use path will lie within the corporate limits of Columbus, and the Department of Public Service has agreed to subsidize a portion of the costs incurred by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office during the completion of the project. \nThis ordinance seeks to authorize the execution of an intergovernmental agreement between the parties and the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $300,000.00 to advance the design phase of the project. Separate legislation authorizing the execution of additional instruments related to subsequent phases of the project and the encumbrance and expenditure of additional capital funding to support the same will be put forth at a later time. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $300,000.00 is available in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.
