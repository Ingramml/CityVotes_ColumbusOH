All strategies are to be executed with cultural humility, equitably, and with focus on topics that contribute the most to serious injuries and fatal crashes. Content could be produced in English, Haitian Creole, French, Portuguese, Nepali, and Spanish. The project will include the development of a comprehensive marketing and communications plan and three major components: research, marketing, and community-engagement. The cultural shift necessary to achieve Vision Zero will require an equitable, multilingual approach that brings awareness of traffic violence prevention to our entire Columbus community.\nOrdinance 1918-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) relative to the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) program, accept and expend awarded grant funds, and issue refunds, if necessary, for the Vision Zero - Multilingual Outreach, Research and Education Project.\n Department of Public Service, Office of Support Services, solicited Requests for Proposals for the Vision Zero - Multilingual Outreach, Research and Education contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services web site from August 14, 2024 to September 11, 2024.
