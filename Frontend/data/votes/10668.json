    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with O.A. Spencer, INC. for the Underground Railroad Playground Project. The contract amount is $180,924.00, with a contingency of $20,000.00, for a total of $200,924.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Underground Railroad Playground Project seeks to capture the historical, cultural, and geographical relevance of the Underground Railroad through the installation of thematic playground equipment and safety surfacing. This project will create the opportunity to educate visitors on an important time in history while engaging all ages and abilities in physical activity and play.\n \nThe Alum Creek corridor served as a major Underground Railroad route for enslaved people to escape from the south to the north in the decades leading up to the American Civil War. Columbus Recreation and Parks is seeking to highlight this time in history and how it has shaped the region through a series of installments in the parks and trails along the Alum Creek corridor. Recreation and Parks intends to develop a new installation annually, and unveil the design each February for Black History Month. The Underground Railroad Playground at Shepard Library and Hayden Park will be the first of these installations.\n \nColumbus Metropolitan Library (CML) owns the land for the planned project location of the Underground Railroad. It is situated between the CML Shepard Branch on the south, Hayden Park on the north, the Alum Creek Greenway Trail on the east, and Nelson Road on the west. Recreation and Parks is working closely with CML to acquire this land. Hayden Park is a 10-acre neighborhood open space in the North Central community. Hayden Park’s primary recreation focus is passive use. Hayden Park is also a trailhead for the Alum Creek Trail, which is a regional greenway trail extending 24.5 miles along the Alum Creek corridor.\n \nThe Shepard Library consists of two parking lots and the library building. No parks or play amenities exist currently in the green space within the property. The library is adjacent to the Alum Creek Trail Connector and is just off of Interstate 670 and East 5th Avenue. The location creates the potential for high traffic through the site and heavy usage of the play equipment. Consideration must be given for future traffic patterns, as CML may have a developer build on the site adjacent to our proposed site in the future.\n \nCML has recently completed a research project on the Underground Railroad. They also created an Underground Railroad exhibit that circulated throughout the CML branches and is available virtually. CML has made their research and exhibit available to Recreation and Parks to use to help guide this project. As this project is developed, Recreation and Parks will work with CML to coordinate a permanent Underground Railroad exhibit at Shepard Library to provide further educational material and continuity between the park and the library.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 23, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 13, 2024.
