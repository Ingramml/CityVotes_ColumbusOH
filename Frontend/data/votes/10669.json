    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Driven Excavating LLC to provide professional services associated with the Big Walnut Water Service Improvement Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $53,014.00.\n \nBig Walnut Park shelter house and Whetstone Park shelter house and maintenance facility needed new water services installed. The existing water services are non-compliant with current Department of Public Utilities rules for metering and backflow prevention.  In addition, the existing services have experienced numerous breaks. They are also lacking the control valves needed to effectively isolate the service during a repair.  The new water services will provide reliable and safe potable water to these facilities.\n \nThe work at Whetstone is complete. It was determined by the Department of Public Utilities that the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department must pay a frontage fee of $36,014.00 in order to install this new water service.  Work is to proceed under an agreement between the Directors, but this fee must be paid by 12/31/24. Also, $2,000.00 for prevailing wage coordination with the Department of Public Service will be paid directly between City Departments.\n \nThis legislation will also add $15,000.00 in contingency to the contract with Driven Excavating in anticipation of encountering unknown sub-grade conditions and utility locations in Big Walnut Park.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDriven Excavating LLC\n121 S.

This is a modification to an existing contract with construction intended to be complete prior to December 2024. \nBenefits to the Public: Residents will be able to enjoy reliable and safe drinking water at Big Walnut and Whetstone Park shelter houses.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: N/A\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far East (58)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality parks for Columbus residents. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $215,551.50 was legislated for the Big Walnut and Whetstone Water Service Improvements Project by Ordinance 2560-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $53,014.00. $53,014.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
