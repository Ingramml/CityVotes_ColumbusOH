    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Latus Studio, LLC for the North Bank Pavilion Renovation Project. The contract amount is $94,760.00, with a contingency of $5,000.00, for a total of $99,760.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nNorth Bank Pavilion is a premiere rental venue generating more than $250,000 annually. Although there have been additional projects to expand its amenities since original construction, the original structure and associated fountain have components dating to when it was first built. In order to keep this facility meeting premiere facility standards, many items need updated, repaired, and given a general overall. This will include replacement of HVAC equipment, which is at end of life and approaching failure.\n \nThe fountain system is failing and many of the 15+ year old components are no longer available. This project will remove the fountain, as an update would require complete replacement of pumps, jets, etc. and the current location conflicts with programming. The area will be expanded to support larger wedding ceremonies, as requested by guests.\n \nThe project should begin construction in November 2025, with the goal of minimizing the impact on rental season, which is April through October.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 20, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 13, 2024. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nLatus Studios, LLC (MAJ)\nBBCO (WBE)\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Latus Studios, LLC was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Latus Studios, LLC and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nLatus Studios, LLC \n3840 N High St, Suite A\nColumbus, OH 43214\nSeth Trance\nContract Compliance Number: 032189\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: October 7, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is required to ensure the construction schedule is maintained as to not disrupt the rental season. This project is anticipated to bid in April 2025 and complete construction November 2025 - April 2026, which is outside the popular booking window.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by revitalizing a popular rental facility and enhancing the rental experience. General park visitors will also be able to enjoy the fresh look of the area and the new amenities that will be added.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Numerous 311 complaints have been received about misuse of the fountain.  Some will not like to see the fountain go as it was sometimes used as a spray ground for children. However, its removal will address the associated health and safety issues.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Downtown (55)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by increasing excellence in programming, service delivery and sustainability. It will also revitalize this facility, offering the community a beautiful place to visit and host memorable events. The facility revitalization will assist in enhancing the efficiency and eliminate the need for capital improvements for many years.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $99,760.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Latus Studio, LLC for the North Bank Pavilion Renovation Project; to authorize the transfer of $99,760.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $99,760.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
