    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThe Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA) was awarded grant funding from the Ohio Traffic Safety Office to administer a statewide CarFit pilot program in Ohio. The CarFit program is designed to help older drivers find out how well they currently fit their personal vehicle, highlight actions they can take to improve their fit, and promote conversations about driver safety and community mobility. A proper fit in one's personal vehicle can greatly increase not only the driver's safety but also the safety of others.\nAs administrators of the program, COAAA will utilize this funding to support a statewide CarFit Coordinator position who will plan and conduct CarFit Event Coordinator and Technician trainings; support and assist with community trainings and events across the state; send regular communication and host quarterly meetings with a statewide network of current CarFit Event Coordinators and Technicians; participate and support the National CarFit Advisory Council, participate on Ohio's Strategic Highway Safety Plan Older Road User Emphasis Area committees; coordinate and oversee reporting information via the CarFit website; track and report statewide process and metrics on CarFit program performance measures.\nThis Ordinance is needed to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to accept and appropriate $104,398.30 in grant funding from the Ohio Traffic Safety Office on behalf of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging. The purpose of this funding is to cover costs associated with administering the CarFit program including hiring and retaining the statewide CarFit Coordinator. The program period for this pilot began on, and will culminate on September 30, 2025.\nFiscal Impact:\nThe Ohio Traffic Safety Office has awarded the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging $104,398.30 to administer the statewide CarFit pilot program. This program is fully funded by the Ohio Traffic Safety Office and does not require a City match.\nThis legislation authorizes the appropriation of $104,398.30 to the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to accept an award of $104,398.30 from the Ohio Traffic Safety Office on behalf of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging for the purposes of administering the statewide CarFit pilot program; and to authorize the appropriation of $104,398.30 to the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund and expenditure thereof; and to declare an emergency.
