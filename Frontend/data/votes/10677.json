    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify two existing contracts with LifeCare Alliance. The first modification is for the provision of food bank and home delivered meals for eligible Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipients for the period of March 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025. This contract was originally set at a price point of $200,000.00 and is being increased by $153,526.00 for a new total contract amount of $353,526.00. The second contract modification is for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program for the provision of food bank and home delivered meals for eligible Ending the Epidemic (EHE) recipients. The term of the contract is March 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025. This contract was originally set at a price point of $175,000.00 and is being increased by $148,932.53 for a new total amount of $323,932.53\n \nLifeCare Alliance is a not-for-profit agency and is exempt from bidding according to bidding requirements of the City Code 329.30.  LifeCare Alliance CC-006078.\nWhy the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded? Additional carryover funds approved and received from the funder of each grant listed above\nWhy it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter?  Funds must be used specific to this service type which is already set up by this agency in existing partnership with the Ryan White Program.\nHow was the price for these additional goods or services determined? The price is provided by the vendor and based on the budget amount of each grant/carryover.  \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that health disparities within the Columbus, Ohio TGA region continue to be addressed for eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS. Emergency action will ensure timely payment to providers and for LifeCare Alliance to be able to continue medical case management services to the community. This modification will allow more Ryan White Part A initiatives to be delivered and will assist in meeting deliverables required by grantor and reduce risk of forfeiture of future grant funds.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: These contracts are fully funded by the Ryan White Part A grant program and the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program and does not generate any revenue or require a city match.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify two existing contracts with LifeCare for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program and the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant programs, for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio for the period of March 1, 2024 through February 28, 2025, to authorize the expenditure of $302,458.53 from the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
