    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the City Attorney to accept State Victims Award Act (SVAA) and federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grant funding from the Ohio Office of the Attorney General, Crime Victims Section. Grant funding supports the City Attorney’s Domestic Violence and Stalking Unit’s (DVSU) Victim Advocacy program.  Award dollars fund: 1) salary for 3.60 full-time Victim Advocates; 2) in-state professional development for DVSU staff; 3) bus passes for victims and prosecuting witnesses; and 4) program supplies.  \n \nThis advocacy program guides and supports victims of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes as they navigate legal processes and systems. VOCA funded advocates are part of a highly-skilled team working daily with city and county prosecutors, law enforcement, court administrators and victim service organizations. This type of coordinated, multi-disciplinary response to domestic violence promotes fair and just criminal outcomes and allows for seamless connection to community-based supports. \n \nFiscal Impact:\nSVAA is a $2,900 State of Ohio award requiring no City match. VOCA is a $160,686.25 federal award administered by the State of Ohio requiring a 20% cash match ($40,171.56).  Matching funds are included in the City Attorney 2024 General Fund budget.\nGrant Period: 10/01/24 - 09/30/25\n                                                                                                                              \nState Share SVAA (2025-SVAA-135897368):                     $ 2,900                                          \nMatching Funds (2025-SVAA-135897368):                     $       0\nTotal Grant Project:                                                                                    $ 2,900                     \n \nState Share VOCA (2025-VOCA-135897364):                     $ 160,686.25                                          \nMatching Funds (2025-VOCA-135897364):                     $   40,171.56                                          \nTotal Grant Project:                                                                                    $ 200,857.81                                                               \n \nTotal SVAA + VOCA awards:                                                                $ 163,586.25\nTotal combined grant awards + match                                           $ 203,757.81\n \nEmergency Action: \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay access to grant funding for material purchases and staff expenses required to achieve the goals and objectives outlined in the award contracts.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to accept State Victims Award Act (SVAA) and federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding from the Office of the Ohio Attorney General in the amount of $163,586.25 to support victim advocacy services; to authorize total appropriation of $163,586.25 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
