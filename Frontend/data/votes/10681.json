    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This legislation authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (hereinafter \"Municipal Court Clerk\") to modify the existing contract with ACI Payments, Inc. (formally known as Official Payments Corporation) to add a civil online account to the electronic payment services and extend the contract for one year for the continuity of the electronic payment services.\n \nOrdinance 2678-2020 authorized the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the contract with Official Payments Corporation to change the company name to ACI Payments, Inc.\n \nThe contract includes the following services: on-line electronic credit card payments, point of sale and electronic checks services (hereinafter “electronic payments services”) for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office. The electronic payment services defer the transaction costs to the user; thereby, decreasing the bank service fees for the Municipal Court Clerk operating budget. \n \nBid Information:\nIn 2009, a formal bidding process was solicited through SA003323. A total of four vendors submitted proposals. The proposals were reviewed by a committee and evaluated in accordance with the committee's criteria. Official Payments Corporation achieved the highest score.  In agreement with the committee, the Municipal Court Clerk awarded the bid to Official Payments Corporations, Inc. \n \nThe on-line electronic credit card service has been ongoing since 2010 at $0.00 cost per year to the Municipal Court Clerk operating budget.\n \nContracts: \nOriginal Contract Number: ED040373 - 1; $0.00\nOrdinance: 1528-2010; ED040373 - 2; $0.00\nOrdinance: 1889-2011; ED045092; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2244-2012; EL013669; $0.00\nOrdinance: 1797-2013: ED049622: $0.00\nOrdinance: 2114-2014: ED051606; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2717-2015; ED054297; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2539-2016; PO032745; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2357-2017; PO095246; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2905-2018; PO146542; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2806-2019; PO200683; $0.00  \nOrdinance: 2144-2020; PO247118; $0.00\nOrdinance: 2678-2020; PO247118: $0.00\nOrdinance: 2709-2021; PO304542: $0.00\nOrdinance: 3310-2022; PO364865: $0.00\nOrdinance: 3334-2023; PO424557: $0.00\nOrdinance: 2857-2024; $0.00\n \n \nContract Compliance Number:  52-2190781\nExpiration Date: 11/29/2025 \nVendor#: 009116\nCurrent Contract Expiration Date: January 31, 2025\n \nFiscal Impact:  No funds are required.\n \n(1) the amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification;\n$0.00\n \n(2) why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded; \nThe civil online account is needed because one of the municipalities in the Court’s jurisdiction started filing civil penalty traffic violations in the Clerk’s Office. The Clerk would like to make it accessible for the public to pay those civil infractions online like they would a criminal traffic violation. \n \n(3) why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter;\nACI does not charge the City of Columbus any money for its services but charges the user a fee when a credit card payment is used. This saves the city money and puts the charge on the user. \n \nand (4) how the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined. \nNo price was determined. $0.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract to add a civil online account and to extend the contract with ACI Payments, Inc. for one year for the provision of electronic payment services. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Municipal Court Clerk's Office has a need to modify the existing contract with ACI Payments, Inc. to add a civil online account to the electronic payment services and extend the contract for one year for electronic payment services; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operations of the Municipal Court Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to enter into a contract with ACI Payments to modify and extend the existing contract for the continuity of the electronic payment services, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.  That the Municipal Court Clerk is authorized and directed to modify the existing contract with ACI Payments, Inc. to add a civil online account to the electronic payment services and extend the contract for one year for the provision of electronic payment services for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office.\n \nSECTION 2. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
