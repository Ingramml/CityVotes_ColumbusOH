    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Tyevco, Inc. for the Westgate Handball and Pickleball Court Improvements Project. The contract amount is $1,175,412.00, with an alternate of $9,660.00, for a total of $1,185,072.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,187,072.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThis project will install four new three-walled outdoor handball courts and four new pickleball courts at Westgate Park. Westgate Park previously had handball courts that were at the end of their useful life and had to be demolished earlier this year. This project seeks to restore the three-walled handball court facilities to the City and provide new facilities for the growing sport of pickleball. There are a limited number of three-walled outdoor handball courts across the state of Ohio and many residents throughout the years have used the Westgate facilities to train for the National Championship tournament held in Toledo, Ohio. The four pickleball courts will be the City's first dedicated pickleball courts in the Greater Hilltop Community.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 27, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 17, 2024.
