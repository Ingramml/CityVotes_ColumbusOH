    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Marker Construction for the Case Road Park Project. The contract amount is $5,000,000.00, with an additional $7,500.00 for interdepartmental inspections and fees, for a total of $5,007,500.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nIn 2018, Recreation and Parks acquired the former Ohio State University Agricultural Extension Sheep Farm at 2425 West Case Road. For several years, the Department had identified the 58 acre site as a key community park space, as the parcel is one of the largest remaining undeveloped open spaces in the entire Northwest Community. The surrounding neighborhoods have played an active role in providing support for the Recreation and Parks Department’s investment in developing this into a signature green space for a highly underserved area. The property is surrounded by high density housing with over 1,000 households within a 10 minute walk. The Carriage Place Community Center is also within 200 yards of the parkland. \n \nThe central core of the property will be developed into a community park with a balance of active and passive amenities, as well as, supportive infrastructure. The active amenities will include sports fields, playgrounds, and sports courts. The passive amenities will be walking trails, meadows, and naturalized areas. An outpost for the City Forestry section will occupy the northeast corner of the site. In addition, area will be reserved for a future Columbus Metropolitan Library Branch at the northwest corner of the property. Coordination between the Recreation and Parks Department and the Columbus Metropolitan Library is ongoing, including potential cost sharing agreements for shared infrastructure.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department proposes to deliver this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) contract.  This delivery method will save the project money and time compared to traditional project delivery methods in this labor short market. CMAR is a “best value” selection in lieu of a “low bid” selection associated with traditional project deliveries. During a “best value” selection, a vendor’s qualifications are evaluated and weighted as part of a total score.  Costs, including project overhead, profit, and contingencies are evaluated, weighted, and scored. The vendor with the highest combined score represents the “best value”.  During this selection process, Marker Construction represented the “best value”.\n \nThis contract will allow for procurement of long lead time materials such as electrical materials, building materials, and roofing. Plans are currently fifty percent complete and materials are ready to be procured. Procuring these materials early reduces the duration of the construction schedule, saving overhead costs for the project which translates into significant project savings for the project. Furthermore, this contract will allow non-permitted and short permitted construction activities, such as demolition and limited site grading, to begin. \n \nThe scope of the work shall include complete construction services starting with planning confirmation, design review, and completion of construction. This project will be constructed under a CMAR delivery method. The selected CMAR will coordinate work with the project design team.  This $5,000,000.00 contract is the first of multiple authorizations that will fund the construction of this park. There will be future guaranteed maximum price amendments for this contract provided by the CMAR after completion of design and competitive bidding for construction. The budget for construction is anticipated to be a total of approximately $16,000,000.00. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 16, 2024 and initial responses were received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 3, 2024. Following the receipt and evaluation of initial proposals and qualifications by the Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) selection committee, three vendors were provided a request for technical proposals and costs. Initial proposals were received from the following vendors:\n \nMarker Construction (WBE)\nRuhlin Co. (MAJ)\nRW Setterlin (MAJ)\nElford (MAJ)\nThey Love Abe (MAJ)\n \nAfter initial proposals were evaluated by the committee, Marker Construction, The Ruhlin Company and R.W. Setterlin Building Co. were the vendors selected to submit technical proposals for review. The selection team recommend Marker Construction to perform the work. The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, project approach, and proposed fees. Marker Construction and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMarker Construction\n2011 Riverside Drive\nColumbus, Ohio 43201\nMike Girouard, (614) 736-1019\nContract Compliance Number: 006989\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 27, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that construction can keep on schedule, allowing for construction to begin in fall 2025 and to avoid escalation of construction material costs due to supply chain issues.\n \nBenefits to the Public: West Case Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the entire northwest region of the City of Columbus.
