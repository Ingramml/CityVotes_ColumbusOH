    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into contract with Guidehouse Inc., in an amount up to $569,000.00, to establish the Regional Housing Coalition and position the new regional entity for success. The contract includes establishing a work plan, stakeholder engagement, and delivering a business plan for the Coalition to then implement. Laying the groundwork for the Coalition is critical for its success in acting as a champion for housing and serving as the regional steward to create partnerships, facilitate support, and continue to convene partners to identify and implement solutions to our housing needs.  Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting September 1, 2024. The expenses are associated with the consultant working with City staff to prepare scheduled tasks as well as organize the workflow between themselves and the City staff to enable the work to begin as soon as possible to meet the deadline for the project.\nThe Central Ohio Region has enjoyed strong economic growth in the past decade with a rise in population and jobs, however our housing supply has not kept pace. Our region is experiencing housing scarcity; we do not have enough homes for the jobs that we have added to our region and this threatens our region’s affordability and economic opportunity. This scarcity is not rooted in a single cause, but is rather a systems-level failure that necessitates a systems-level response. Our region holds many outstanding experts, organizations, and jurisdictions focused on housing, but their good work is often siloed and not coordinated or supported at a regional level. Similar to how we have approached other critical infrastructure in our region, this regional problem merits a regional solution, which lies within the formation of the Regional Housing Coalition. \nIn late 2021 civic leadership met to set a new path for Central Ohio to maintain the region’s affordability as economic growth continues. Therefore, the first action undertaken by the civic leadership was to convene four task forces, each led by regional scale organizations which had led the growth impact planning efforts and asked them to identify actionable tasks that could be implemented to ensure that the housing infrastructure that the region needs gets built as the growth occurs. Each task force focused on specific challenges facing the region; supply, affordability, equity and advocacy and coordination. \nThe task forces engaged more than 150 community stakeholders and developed a comprehensive list of actions that at the regional scale would deliver the housing the region needs to support its growth and ensure prosperity for all families in the region. The task forces identified a number of opportunities for improving the communication, coordination and collaboration to develop a functional and affordable regional housing market. \nBased on the outcomes of the task force work it is clear that there is not an existing organization that can undertake the implementation of the recommendations. The politically complex nature of Central Ohio which includes a diverse set of jurisdictions, employers and civic infrastructure requires a new entity to lead the critical work of developing the housing infrastructure needed for the Columbus region. Through contracting with Guidehouse, the City of Columbus can ensure that a solid foundation is built to establish and stand-up the Coalition for its long-term success in meeting central Ohio’s housing needs. \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide funding for the establishment of the Regional Housing Coalition and implementation of planning tasks.\n \nBid Waiver Request:  A waiver of the competitive procurement requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329.18 is being requested, as Guidehouse Inc. is currently working with Franklin County and the State of Ohio on housing issues and the urgency to create the Coalition and maintain the planning timeline.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this agreement is included in the Department of Development’s 2024\nGeneral Fund Budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Guidehouse Inc. vendor number is 023190 and vendor compliance is pending.\n.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the expenditure of up to $569,000.00 from the 2024 General Fund Operating Budget; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Guidehouse Inc. to establish the Regional Housing Coalition and position the new regional entity for success; to pay for consultant planning related expenses incurred before the purchase order was approved, and to declare an emergency.
