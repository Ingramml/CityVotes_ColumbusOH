    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase a contract with Azteca Systems, LLC to provide software for the Cityworks Asset Management System (AMS). The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $556,860.00.\n \nCityworks AMS will be a department wide Asset Management solution and will replace Oracle WAM. The software contract is an annual Enterprise licensing agreement that includes cloud-hosting services. The Cityworks solution will modernize our Work and Asset Management program by enabling best practices and GIS to empower DPU to better track, maintain and manage assets across our entire organization. Cityworks provides three hosting environments, which include one each for testing, production, and development. The Department of Public Utilities will have 718 licenses and the Division of Fire will have 282 licenses. the Division of Fire will be using these licenses in collaboration with the Division of Water to support the maintenance and inspection process for Fire Hydrants across the City. Each Cityworks license costs $821.00 and the Department of Public Utilities is provided a different discount percentage for the four successive years. For this renewal the discount is 34%, making the cost per user $541.86. In year two the discount is 25%, in year three the discount is 12%, and finally, in year four the discount is 5%. \n \nDue to a Request for Proposal (RFQ018791) that was published for the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to obtain an Asset Management System, Woolpert, Inc. was the awarded firm and the software solution they chose in the proposal was Cityworks. It has been determined that establishing one contract for services with Woolpert, Inc. and one contract for software directly with Azteca Systems, LLC (Cityworks) is the best path forward, and it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a contract with Azteca Systems, LLC. \n \nThe original contract (PO356535) was established in accordance with the pertinent provisions to waive for competitive bidding of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code and authorized with Ord. 2517-2022. Services under the original contract cover a one (1) year period from date of execution with the option to renew annually for an additional five (5) years on a year-to-year basis, or a portion thereof, based on mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds and approval of Columbus City Council. This renewal No. 2 is to provide the necessary funding for the continuation of the Cityworks Asset Management System. This proposed renewal No. 2 is for year three (3) of the contract and to extend the contract through 11/13/2025 and add $556,860.00. Total amount including this renewal is $1,358,860.00. This contract shall not automatically renew. All other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. \n \n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal No. 2 is $556,860.00.  Total contract amount including this renewal is $1,358,860.00.\n \n2.

Reason other procurement processes were not used:  Work under this renewal No. 2 is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract.  No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4. How was cost determined:  The cost, terms, and conditions are negotiated based on the quantity of users.
