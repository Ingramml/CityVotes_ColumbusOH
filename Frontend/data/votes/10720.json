    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify a contract on behalf of the Fleet Management Division with Ricart Properties Inc. for vehicle alignment and Ford OEM repair services.\n \nThe City of Columbus previously bid and successfully awarded Ricart Properties Inc. the contract for front end alignment and Ford OEM repair services, pursuant to bid solicitation RFQ027247. Two bids were received and opened on April 21st 2024. Ricart Properties Inc was found to be the lowest, responsible and best bidder.\n \nThis contract is for one, from June 24th 2024 to May 31st 2025 by the City of Columbus with the option of the three (3) renewals available made on a year-to-year basis upon mutual agreement, budgeted funds and approval by Columbus City Council.  If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.\n \nThe originally contracted amount of $110,000.00 has been utilized and the amount is set to be depleted by the end of November. The contract grew from $50,000.00 to $110,000.00 in 2023 and was not increased when made in 2024. The growing utilization of this contract for front-end alignments and Ford OEM repair services is critical to the operations of Fleet Management and the City of Columbus. An increase in the number of OEM repairs and an increase in the number of vehicles serviced by Fleet Management makes the continuation of these services critical to the continued operation of the City of Columbus Fleet. Expenses are tracking $25,000.00 a month, which is how the additional funding of $150,000.00 requested was calculated, based on the contract ending on May 31st. It is in the best interest of the City to not have a lapse in availability for these services, as they are critical to keeping vehicles of the City of Columbus Fleet operational, which a new bid would require. At the time of awarding of this contract is not foreseen that there would be such a large increase in usage of this contract this year. More Ford Vehicles has equated to more Ford OEM repairs being necessary and utilization of this contract has ballooned from $11,000 a month to nearly $25,000 a month, attributable to increased need and price increases.\n \nThis Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to modifying a service contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  Ricart Properties, Inc., Certification Number CC-004963 Expiration: 01/09/2026, D365#004963,\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes a modification of the contract from $110,000.00 to $260,000.00 from the Fleet Operating Fund for Ford OEM repairs and vehicle alignments.\n$71,189.29 (64.72% of the contract) has been spent since June 24th of 2024\n$110,000.00 was spent in 2023\n$50,000.00 was spent in 2022\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: This ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to allow the continuation of vital services to keep the Department of Finance and Management - Fleet Management division, Police, Fire and a number of other City of Columbus divisions operations running efficiently for the health and prosperity of City of Columbus citizens\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to modify a contract with Ricart Properties, Inc. for vehicle alignments and Ford OEM repairs from  $110,000.00 to $260,000.00 and to authorize the expenditure of an additional $150,000.00 from the Fleet Management Operating Fund and to declare an emergency.
