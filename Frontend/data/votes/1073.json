    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with E. P. Ferris & Associates for design of the Roadway - Sullivant Avenue - Hague to I70 project.\nOrdinance 0675-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with E. P.

P. Ferris & Associates.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for E. P.
