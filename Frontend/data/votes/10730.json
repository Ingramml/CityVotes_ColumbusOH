    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The need exists to amend Ordinance No. 1431-2024, passed by Columbus City Council (“Council) on June 3, 2024, which authorized the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Community Reinvestment Area Agreement (the “AGREEMENT” or “CRA Agreement”) between the City of Columbus (CITY) and Big Lots Management, LLC (the “Enterprise”). An amendment is now required to revise the associated contributors to the job creation and payroll commitments as set forth in the CRA Agreement. \n \nColumbus City Council (COUNCIL), by Ordinance 1775-2016, passed July 18, 2016 authorized the City of Columbus (CITY) to enter into a Community Reinvestment Area Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with The Hamilton Crossing LC LLC & Big Lots, Inc. to grant a tax abatement of one-hundred percent (100%) for a period of ten (10) years in consideration of a proposed investment of approximately $30,000,000.00 to $45,000,000.00 investment in new building construction, the retention and relocation of approximately seven hundred fifty (750) existing full-time permanent positions with an associated payroll of $65,000,000.00, and the creation of five (5) new full-time positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $362,500 related to the construction of a new approximately 300,000 square-foot facility and one or more associated parking structures to be used as the corporate headquarters facility for BIG LOTS (the “PROJECT”) at the southwest quadrant of State Route 161 and Hamilton Road on parcel number 010- 221377, Columbus, Ohio 43081 and within the Hamilton-161 Community Reinvestment Area (the “PROJECT SITE”). \n \nThe First Amendment for Assignment and Assumption to the AGREEMENT (the “FIRST AMENDMENT”) was made and entered into effective on November 3, 2016. Pursuant Section 22 (Transfer and/or Assignment) of the AGREEMENT (“SECTION 22”) it states that “The ENTERPRISE shall have the express authority to assign this AGREEMENT in whole or in part to (i) any entity within BIG LOTS GROUP or (ii) the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority…” and “in the same manner, each assignee also shall have the express authority to wholly or partially assign this AGREEMENT to any of the foregoing.” Whereas, with respect to the Finance Authority Structures the ENTERPRISE added Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority in party to the AGREEMENT and assigned all the benefits of the CRA Agreement. \n \nPursuant the Second Amendment for Assignment and Assumption to the AGREEMENT (the “SECOND AMENDMENT”) was made and entered into effective on October 31, 2019 the Finance Authority assigned BLHQ, LLC all of the benefits of the AGREEMENT which the Finance Authority received in the FIRST AMENDMENT, including, but not limited to, the benefits of the AGREEMENT with respect to the Finance Authority Structures as set forth in Section 1 of the FIRST AMENDMENT. \n \nPrior to the execution of the AGREEMENT, the Department of Development received a notification that one of the lessee’s (WPG Management Associates, Inc.) has their employees of record under the entity WPG Real Estate Associates, Inc. The Company has leased 59,390 square feet of office space at the PROJECT SITE to WPG Real Estate Associates, Inc. as well as any other additional new tenant that will occupy the space at the PROJECT SITE to contribute to the job and payroll retention commitments as set forth in the AGREEMENT. Additionally, BLHQ, LLC would like to assign Big Lots Management, LLC all of the benefits of the AGREEMENT. \n \nColumbus City Council (Council) by Ordinance 2849-2015, designated the Hamilton-161 Community Reinvestment Area as a “Community Reinvestment Area” pursuant to Chapter 3735 of the Ohio Revised Code.
