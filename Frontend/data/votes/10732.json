    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City of Columbus (“City”) to amend for a fourth time the Development Agreement dated July 3, 2019 (the “Development Agreement”) originally by and among the City, Franklin County (“County”), and Crew SC Stadium Company, LLC (“StadCo”), and to amend and restate for the first time the Housing Development Agreement dated November 10, 2021 (the “2021 HDA”) between the City and Confluence Development, LLC. The Development Agreement outlines certain mutual commitments of the parties related to (i) the financing, development, construction, operation, and occupancy of a new multi-purpose sports, entertainment, cultural and recreational facility (“Stadium”), (ii) the redevelopment of the MAPFRE Stadium site into a practice facility and training complex for Columbus Crew SC (the “Training Facility Project”), (iii) a community sports park campus that will include a community recreation facility and playing fields (“CSP”), and (iv) the development of a project containing mixed-use retail, entertainment, residential, hospitality, office and/or commercial uses (“Mixed-Use Development”) adjacent to the Stadium. \n \nThe First Amendment to the Development Agreement added the Confluence Community Authority (“Authority”) and Crew SC Development Company, LLC (“DeveloperCo”) as parties to the Development Agreement, and assigned all of the rights and obligations of StadCo under the Development Agreement to DeveloperCo, an affiliate company. The Second Amendment to the Development Agreement (“Second Amendment”) added CrewSC Training Company, LLC (“TrainingCo”), an agent of DeveloperCo, as a party to the Development Agreement to implement the Training Facility Project, memorialized DeveloperCo’s workforce housing commitment, memorialized the City’s commitments for certain public infrastructure improvements and the public parking garage within the Mixed-Use Development, and the timing and funding of the CSP.  The Third Amendment to the Development Agreement will expand the location of the CSP to include other potential sites including the City-owned Kilbourne Run Sports Park.\n \nPursuant to the Second Amendment, the City and Confluence Development, LLC (an affiliate of DeveloperCo and the owner of the Mixed-Use Development), entered into the 2021 HDA. Confluence Development, LLC agreed that each applicable phase of the Mixed-Use Development would include no less than ten percent of the occupied housing units to be affordable to persons with household incomes up to 80% AMI, and an additional ten percent of the occupied housing units to be affordable to persons with household incomes up to 100% AMI (the “Original Affordable Housing Commitment”). The Fourth Amendment to the Development Agreement (“Fourth Amendment”) will increase the Original Affordable Housing commitment from 20% to 25% of all occupied housing units, and thereby increased Confluence Development, LLC’s Original Affordable Housing Commitment under the First Amended and Restated Housing Development Agreement (the “A&R HDA”), too. Twenty percent of the occupied housing units are to be affordable to persons with household incomes up to 80% AMI, and an additional 5% of the occupied housing units are to be affordable to persons with household incomes up to 100% AMI (the “New Affordable Housing Commitment”). This legislation will also authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute and approve both the A&R HDA with Confluence Development, LLC, and the Fourth Amendment by and among the City, County, Authority, StadCo, DeveloperCo, and Training Co, as well as to take all actions necessary to implement the New Affordable Housing Commitment and each of those agreements and this Ordinance. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into the Fourth Amendment and the A&R HDA as the New Affordable Housing Commitment is condition of the City allowing the parties to promptly close on the refinancing of portions of the project, which such refinancing will enable the Mixed-Use Development to begin construction thereby enabling the provision of workforce housing units to which there is an undersupply within the City, all  for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute the Fourth Amendment to the Development Agreement by and among the City, Franklin County, Confluence Community Authority, Crew SC Development Company, LLC Crew SC Stadium Company, LLC, and Crew SC Training Company, LLC for the purposes of memorializing new commitments relating to workforce housing; to authorize the aforesaid Director to also execute the First Amended and Restated Housing Development Agreement between the City and Confluence Development, LLC for the purposes of memorializing new commitments relating to workforce housing; and to declare an emergency.
