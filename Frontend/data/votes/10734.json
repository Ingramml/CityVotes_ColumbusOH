    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City with Franklin County, Confluence Community Authority, Crew SC Development Company, LLC, and Crew SC Stadium Company, LLC entered into a Development Agreement and First Amendment authorized by Ordinance No. 1730-2019 and Second Amendment authorized by Ordinance No. 1492-2021 (all three collectively and as may be amended further, the “EDA”). Under the EDA, the parties made commitments relating to the development of a new multi-purpose sports, entertainment, cultural and recreational facility (the “Stadium”), and a project containing mixed-use retail, entertainment, residential, hospitality, office and/or commercial uses (the “Mixed-Use Development” and together with the Stadium, the “Project”). In order to further implement the EDA, Ordinance No. 2545-2020, as amended by Ordinance No. 3265-2021 (together, the “TIF Ordinance”), was passed by City Council to establish a tax increment financing area over the Project (the “Stadium 41 TIF”). The non-school portion of the Stadium 41 TIF service payments deposited with the City are remitted to pay debt service related to the Project and other approved purposes (the “Obligations”) pursuant to the Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement dated February 23, 2021 (the “TIF Agreement”) by and among the City, the Confluence Community Authority, and Confluence Development LLC authorized by Ordinance No. 2571-2020. As market conditions changed significantly since entering into the TIF Agreement due to the subsequent economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have delayed the Mixed-Use Development, Confluence Development LLC and the developer of the Mixed-Used Development have requested the City to amend the TIF Ordinance to remove the undeveloped real estate portion of the Mixed-Use Development, anticipated to be valued upon completion of a 690 unit multifamily residential development at approximately $86.25 million, from the Stadium 41 TIF to create a new tax increment financing area (the “Astor Park TIF”). The creation of the Astor Park TIF will allow for the collection of a full thirty years of service payments from the currently undeveloped Mixed-Use Development, which will ensure there are sufficient revenues available to repay the Obligations. \n \nThis Ordinance amends the TIF Ordinance and establishes the Astor Park TIF pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.41 to provide for a one-hundred percent (100%) exemption from real property taxation on improvements to the parcels within the Astor Park TIF for separate periods of not more than 30 years on each of the parcels. Annual service payments in lieu of taxes will be made by the owners of each parcel with respect to the improvements to the Astor Park TIF parcels. Columbus City Schools will receive, in the same manner as usual, all amounts that it would have received in real property taxes had this exemption not been granted. The applicable portion of the service payments will be distributed directly to Columbus City Schools. The remaining non-school portion of those service payments will be paid to the City for deposit into the appropriate TIF fund established by this Ordinance to then finance the Obligations. This Ordinance will also appropriate and authorize the Astor Park TIF service payments in accordance with the TIF Agreement, and this Ordinance will authorize an amendment to the TIF Agreement for those purposes.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation. The City is foregoing one-hundred percent (100%) of the real property tax revenue that it would have received from development of the Astor Park TIF parcels (tax revenue that is already foregone under the existing Stadium 41 TIF). Instead, the non-school portion of that revenue will be diverted to the new TIF fund.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to amend the Stadium 41 TIF, create the new Astor Park TIF, and authorize the Director to enter into an amendment to the Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement dated February 23, 2021, which will allow the parties to promptly close on the refinancing of portions of the project, which such refinancing will enable the Mixed-Use Development to begin construction thereby enabling the provision of workforce housing units to which there is an undersupply within the City, all  for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 2545-2020, as previously amended by Ordinance No. 3265-2021, by removing Franklin County Tax ID Parcel Nos 010-303975, 010-300555, and 010-300556 owned by Confluence Development LLC from the Stadium 41 TIF; to declare the improvements to those parcels to be a public purpose and exempt from real property taxation pursuant to R.C. 5709.41 to create the new Astor Park TIF; to require the owners of those parcels to make service payments in lieu of taxes; to require the distribution of the applicable portion of those service payments to the Columbus City Schools; to establish an urban redevelopment tax increment equivalent fund for the deposit of the remainder of those service payments; to appropriate and authorize the expenditure and transfer of revenues deposited in the aforementioned Astor Park TIF fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an amendment to the Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement dated February 23, 2021 by and among the City, the Confluence Community Authority, and Confluence Development LLC to provide those appropriated revenues to the Confluence Community Authority for certain obligations thereunder; and to declare an emergency.($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City is engaged in urban redevelopment with Franklin County, Confluence Community Authority, Crew SC Development Company, LLC, and Crew SC Stadium Company, LLC, by entering into a Development Agreement and First Amendment authorized by Ordinance No. 1730-2019 and Second Amendment authorized by Ordinance No. 1492-2021 (all three collectively and as may be amended further, the “EDA”); and\n \nWHEREAS, the EDA provides for among other things the development of a new multi-purpose sports, entertainment, cultural and recreational facility (the “Stadium”) and a project containing mixed-use retail, entertainment, residential, hospitality, office and/or commercial uses (the “Mixed-Use Development” together with the Stadium, the “Project”); and\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to the EDA in order for the City to support the development of the Project with tax increment financing under R.C.

Section 5709.41, which requires the City to hold fee title to the Parcels prior to enacting this Ordinance, the City held fee title to the Parcels (or parent parcels) in 2020 via quit-claim deeds recorded with the Franklin County Recorder’s Office as Instrument Nos. 202011120179454 and 202011120179455; and\n \nWHEREAS, this Council has determined that it is necessary and appropriate and in the best interest of the City to exempt from taxation one hundred percent (100%) of the improvements to each of the Parcels  as permitted and provided for in the TIF Statutes for separate periods of up to thirty (30) years for each of the Parcels and to simultaneously direct and require the current and future owner(s) of each of the Parcels (each such owner individually, an “Owner,” and collectively, the “Owners”) to make annual service payments in lieu of taxes, including any penalties and interest (collectively, the “Service Payments”), in the same amount as they would have made real property tax payments but for the exemption provided by this Ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City has determined that a portion of the Service Payments shall be paid directly to the Columbus City School District (the “School District”) in an amount equal to the real property taxes that School District would have been paid if the improvement to each of the Parcels located within that School District had not been exempt from taxation pursuant to this Ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.43(B), this Council has determined to establish an urban redevelopment tax increment equivalent fund (the “TIF Fund”) in which there shall be deposited the remaining non-school Service Payments distributed to the City as provided herein; and\n \nWHEREAS, notice of this proposed Ordinance has been delivered to the Board of Education of the School District in accordance with and within the time periods prescribed in R.C.
