That scope of work necessitates that the Department of Public Service engage Norfolk Southern Railway Company to review and approve engineering plans, design plans, construction specifications, and drawings, and other documents and to perform other services necessary to the completion of the project in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors. The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $24,500.00 to compensate Norfolk Southern Railway Company for said services. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $24,500.00 is available for this project in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within the Department of Public Service. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is to provide sufficient budget authority for the requisite expenditure. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to make requisite funding available within the next 30 days so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion and acceptance of design plans.  \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $24,500.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund relative to the Roadway - Leonard Ave Improvements under RR Bridge project; and to declare an emergency.  ($24,500.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is administering the Roadway - Leonard Ave Improvements under RR Bridge project, which encompasses various roadway, pedestrian, drainage, and lighting improvements under the Leonard Avenue railroad bridge in the vicinity of 5th and Woodland avenues; and \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned effort requires cooperation from Norfolk Southern Railway Company, which operates within the proposed project limits; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Department of Public Service to engage Norfolk Southern Railway Company to review and approve engineering and design plans, construction specifications and drawings, and other documents and to perform other services necessary to the successful completion of the planned improvements; and \nWHEREAS, the purpose of this legislation is to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $24,500, which represents the estimated cost of those services; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget to provide sufficient budget authority for the requisite expenditure; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this legislation in order to make requisite funding available within the next 30 days so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion and acceptance of design plans, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
