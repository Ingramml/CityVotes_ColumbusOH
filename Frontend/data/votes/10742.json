    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Designing Local, LTD to provide professional services associated with the Signage Program Update Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $190,000.00.\n \nThis is a planned modification to execute the action items identified in Phase 1 of the Signage Program Update Project. Phase 1 of this effort included a holistic audit and analysis of the signage masterplan, brand position, 2D print, and 3D environments. The initial scope also included digital and virtual applications to understand success criteria for the future sign standards. Summary reports were produced to identify the drivers, challenges, key criteria, and opportunities to deliver the best-in-class signage experience.\n \nPhase 2 will include visualizing and documenting the updated design framework. The framework will include a tiered approach to address all of the Department’s assets. It will emphasize code compliance, sustainability, and production methods in addition to brand identification. Phase 3 will include the creation of a design manual and templates based on the designs selected to move forward in Phase 2. Phases 2 and 3 are anticipated to be complete in the winter of 2025.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDesigning Local, LTD\n20 East Broad Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nMatt Leasure, (614) 607-1557\nContract Compliance Number: 020995\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: June 18, 2026\n \nBenefits to the Public: Park signs strengthen the Department’s identity and improve user experience. Recreation and Park’s current sign system is partially outdated and does not fully reflect its branding goals and identity. Updating signs will enhance park users’ ability to understand critical wayfinding information and connect to the Department’s brand.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community members have shared park concerns and replacement requests primarily through 311 inquiries. Community members have also expressed a need for more accessible signage through enhanced graphic design.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department Master Plan by improving overall design standards. By improving departmental signage throughout the system, this project will also improve the safety of facilities and parks while removing access and circulation barriers.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $49,915.00 was legislated for the 2023 Signage Program Update by Ordinance 1417-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $190,000.00. $190,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $239,915.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Designing Local, LTD to provide professional services associated with the Signage Program Update Project; to authorize the transfer of $190,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; and to authorize the expenditure of $190,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
