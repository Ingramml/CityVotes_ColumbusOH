In Be The One, RUUS leads program activity building and developing community skills with students in grades 7 through 12 one day a week, involving over 300 students on a weekly basis. The Senior Capstone utilized Lead 4 Change workbooks and materials to provide a senior capstone project for the students to earn them completion in the class, an Ohio Jobs Readiness Seal, and points towards alternate paths towards graduation.
