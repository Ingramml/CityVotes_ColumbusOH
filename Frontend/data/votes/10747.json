    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify (Modification 3) a not-for-profit service contract with The Tony R. Wells Foundation, to add funding in an amount up to $225,000.00 for the purpose of acting as fiscal manager of the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) program.  Funding will be advanced on a predetermined schedule.\nOriginal Contract                                                        $267,500.00                     Ord. 2768-2022                                          PO363646\nModification 1                                                                $133,750.00                     Ord. 3069-2023                                          PO423050\nModification 2                                                                 $249,845.00                     Ord. 2172-2024                                          PO465105\nModification 3                                                                $225,000.00                     Ord. 2971-2024\nTotal contract amount                                          $876,095.00\n \nThe Housing Division adapted the ADDI program to use non-federal funds for the purpose of down payment assistance for homebuyers not in the Homeownership Development program.   This expansion increased accessibility of the program to applicants up to 120% AMI and reduced the time to compile and review a file as specific HUD related required documents will not be required for this source of funds.  \n \nThe Tony R. Wells Foundation, a non-profit corporation, will act as a fiscal manager for the program.  The additional funding provided by this modification will allocate $209,250.00 for downpayment assistance for low, moderate and middle income homebuyers and $15,750.00 (at 7% of the funds distributed) for administrative costs for the Wells Foundation.  The contract is awarded in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to not-for-profit service contracts.  The funds will all be provided to the Wells Foundation up front with ongoing reporting on disbursements.  \n \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nThis legislation will increase the amount of the contract by $225,000.00 to provide downpayment assistance to homebuyers through the end of the contract term, March 31, 2025.  \n \nEmergency action is requested to modify and extend the agreement to prevent disruption of the ADDI program that provides down payment assistance for homebuyers.                     \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the 2024 General Fund Operating budget, but will require a transfer between divisions and object classes.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 038668 and expires 6/22/2025.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify a not-for-profit service contract to add funding, in an amount up to $225,000.00, with The Tony R. Wells Foundation for the purpose of acting as fiscal manager of the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) program; to authorize the transfer and expenditure of up to $225,000.00 from the 2024 General Fund Budget; to advance funding per a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
