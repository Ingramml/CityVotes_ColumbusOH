The grants will protect children and families with incomes at or below eighty percent of the area median income level by targeting significant lead and health hazards in over 7,400 low-income homes for which other resources are not available.  The Healthy Homes Production Grant Program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD’s successful Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department’s efforts to holistically address a variety of high-priority housing-based health and safety hazards, such as mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, pests, carbon monoxide, injury and safety hazards, in addition to lead-based paint. \n \nThis modification will extend the term of the contract to continue to provide radon testing services as authorized per the Healthy Homes Production Grant through December 31, 2025. \n \nThis is a planned modification to continue to provide the services needed for the term of the grant.  \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is needed to extend the term of the agreement through the period of performance of the grant in order to continue to support those who are living in a home with a health and or safety hazards such as lead, mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, etc. by addressing the issues to assure they can stay in their homes. \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is necessary.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 005113 and expires 10/21/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with The Inservice Training Network, Inc. to extend the term of the agreement from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025; and declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development executed an agreement with Inservice Training Network for lead and RRP training services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the agreement term needs to be extend in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is necessary to extend the term of the agreement through the period of performance of the grant in order to continue to support those who are living in a home with a health and or safety hazards such as lead, mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, etc. by addressing the issues to assure they can stay in their homes, all for the preservation of the public, health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and  NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify a contract (PO380461) to extend the agreement term to December 31, 2025, in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated.\n \nSECTION 2: That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
