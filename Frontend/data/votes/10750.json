    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing services contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. for an increased amount of $10,000.00 in addition to the original contract of $13,121.41 for a revised total contract amount not to exceed $23,121.41. Columbus Public Health has a need to provide clients identified and certified as uninsured and receiving services from Columbus Public Health Alcohol and Drug Services Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program, buprenorphine in accordance with their prescription services. These services will be provided at Columbus Public Health Alcohol and Drug Services. The contract period is from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 with the option to renew for three additional one-year periods. \n \nBids were solicited for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) services in FY22. No vendors responded to the bid. Alcohol and Drug Services sought and received a direct quote for the MAT services from Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. Both the bid solicitation and the FY22 contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. for MAT services included language in the scope indicating the awarded contract may be renewable on a yearly calendar basis during the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2027.\n \n1) The amount of the additional funds to be expended under the modification; $10,000.00\n \n2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded; MAT services were provided for a higher number of patients during the FY24, which obligated more funds each month than in previous years.\n \n3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter; Pharmaceutical Services RFQ021960 solicited bids for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) services in FY22. No vendors responded. Alcohol and Drug Services sought and received a direct quote for the MAT services from Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. RFQ021960 and the FY22 contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. for MAT services included language in the scope indicating the awarded contract may be renewable on a yearly calendar basis during the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2027.\n \n4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined. Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. provides a price sheet for the cost of the medications used in the ADS MAT services program.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that quality Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) services continue to be available to eligible MAT clients, to ensure timely payment to providers, and for Columbus Public Health Alcohol and Drug Services to be able to continue offering MAT services to their existing work which aligns with grant deliverables.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThis contract is fully funded by the Alcohol and Drug Outpatient Treatment Men’s Grant 2024 and the ADS 2023 State Opiate and Stimulant Grant SOS 3.2 and does not generate any revenue or require a city match ($10,000.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify existing contracts with the vendor Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., for the Alcohol and Drug Outpatient Treatment Men’s Grant 2024 and the ADS 2023 State Opiate and Stimulant Grant SOS 3.2 programs to add additional funding; for the provision of services allowable under the grant for eligible clients for the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024; to authorize the expenditure of $10,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
