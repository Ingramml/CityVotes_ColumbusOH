    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with The RISE Center, Inc. in an amount up to $450,000.00 to provide funding to integrate economic mobility accelerators (Accelerators) within their Ready, Set, RISE (RSR) grant program.  Authorization to pay for administrative and/or staffing expenses incurred before the purchase order, starting October 1, 2024, and to authorize the advancement of funds on a predetermined schedule is also requested. \n \nIn today’s post-COVID economy, many Columbus residents are challenged with making ends meet, yet they continue to work hard to increase their income and attain economic stability. Challenges to achieving economic stability include stagnant wages and rising costs (e.g. housing, child care, and food).  These conditional cash transfers to residents participating in economic mobility initiatives will accelerate their economic mobility.\n \nBy increasing financial security, individuals can experience improved health and well-being as stress, anxiety and depression are decreased. Stability in housing and employment enables better outcomes for children in health, education and social connection. Moving toward greater economic stability can shape one’s opportunities and aspirations with promises of a better future.\n \nThe public purpose of this agreement is to establish a partnership with The RISE Center, Inc. to accelerate the economic mobility of individuals experiencing poverty in Columbus.\n \nThe RISE (Resident Initiatives for Success and Empowerment) Center was organized to serve as the nonprofit arm of the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA).      Accelerators are time-limited payments of unrestricted funds to individuals engaged in an economic mobility initiative that is supported by a non-profit organization. Participating residents of CMHA will work with RSR Career and Life Navigators to obtain and sustain full-time employment that will lead to economic self-sufficiency.\n \nThe RISE Center, with back-office assistance from CMHA, will make the payments directly to the individuals.  They will also provide each recipient with a 1099.  A portion of the grant amount will be an administration fee for RSR’s services.  In addition, the RISE Center will oversee an independent evaluation to provide recommendations for improving, scaling and replicating the initiative.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding of $450,000.00 is available in Fund 2237, Neighborhood Economic Development Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s vendor number is 049228 and expires 02/03/2027.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with The RISE Center, Inc. in an amount up to $450,000.00 to provide funding to integrate economic mobility accelerators (Accelerators) with their Ready, Set, RISE (RSR) grant program; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $450,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development; to pay for administrative and/or staffing expenses incurred prior to purchase order execution; and to authorize the advancement of funds on a predetermined schedule.
