    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nMany grants and projects with the City require initial expenditures by the City with subsequent reimbursement by the grantor or lender. This legislation will simply authorize and provide cash flow capabilities for the City to continue the construction of projects and/or the services while waiting for such reimbursement.\n \nBased on review of outstanding and/or pending reimbursement requests for certain capital grants, in addition to the more traditional operating grants, authorization of $5,000,000.00 per grant/project is requested. \n \nFiscal Impact: None. Advances authorized herein are temporary. \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that these temporary advances are processed prior to fiscal year end deadlines, preventing construction and project delays related to reimbursement timing.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the advance of funds to grants and projects of up to $5,000,000.00 per grant or project; and to authorize the reimbursement of such advances on the receipt of such monies from the originating grantor or lender; and to declare an emergency. ($5,000,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, many grants and projects with the City require initial expenditures by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, such expenditures are subsequently reimbursed to the City from the grantor or lender; and\n \nWHEREAS, temporary advances of funds can prevent any potential interruption of services or construction dependent on these grants and projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, based on review of outstanding and/or pending reimbursement requests for certain capital grants, in addition to the more traditional operating grants, authorization of $5,000,000.00 per grant/project is requested; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Auditor's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize these temporary advances so that they may be made by fiscal year end deadlines, preventing construction and project delays related to reimbursement timing, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to advance funds from General Fund - Income Tax Set-Aside subfund 1000-100099 to grants and projects awaiting reimbursements of previously made expenditures in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000.00 per grant/project.\nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to restore funds to General Fund - Income Tax Set-Aside subfund 1000-100099 when such grant and project reimbursements are received by the City.\n \nSECTION 3.  That necessary funds are hereby deemed appropriated to carry out the purposes of this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten day after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
