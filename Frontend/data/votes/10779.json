    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND AND FISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAs part of the 2024 third quarter financial review, the Department of Finance and Management identified surpluses and deficits in various object classes in several divisions.  In order to properly align appropriations with projected expenditures and allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2024, it is necessary to transfer $49,632,500.00 among divisions within the general fund and $2,188,000.00 in certain non-general fund departments and divisions.\n \nObject class surpluses and deficits were projected as part of the third quarter financial review.  This ordinance makes transfers to reflect these projections.   The amounts may not mirror the third quarter review exactly due to transfers that have occurred in the interim as well as adjustments made in projections since the completion of the review.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes appropriation transfers and additional appropriations for certain non-general fund departments and divisions in order to provide appropriations in the necessary object classes for the remainder of the fiscal year. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow these financial transactions to be posted in the city's accounting system as soon as possible to allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2024.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to provide for the transfer of $49,632,500.00 within the general fund; to transfer $2,188,000.00 in appropriations between objects in certain non-general fund departments and divisions; to authorize appropriations within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize transfers between funds of $650,000.00; to authorize an appropriation within the Recreation and Parks Operating fund and the Employee Benefits fund, and to declare an emergency ($52,470,500.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the third quarter financial review, conducted by the Department of Finance and Management, identified projected surpluses and deficits in various object classes of several general fund and non-general fund divisions; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer funds between objects, divisions and funds in order to allow divisions to continue to operate through the end of 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transactions to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible, promoting accurate accounting and financial management; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds, and make additional appropriations to allow departments and divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2024, all for the immediate preservation of the public, health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and Now, Therefore;\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.   That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer $49,632,500.00 between various divisions and object classes within the general fund, fund 1000, subfund 100010 according to the account codes in the following: \n \nAttachment: 2024 3rd qtr trx.xlsx   2024 3rd Qtr TRX Amended\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer appropriations in the amount of $603,000.00 within the Health operating fund, fund 2250, subfund 000000, according to the account codes in the following:\n \nAttachment: 2024 3rd qtr trx.xlsx  2024 3rd Qtr TRX Amended\n \nSECTION 3.
