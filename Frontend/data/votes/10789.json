    "description": "Explanation\n   \nBackground: \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Harrell's LLC for the purchase of Syngenta golf course pesticides for the Recreation and Parks Department as a result of waiving the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code 329.\n \nThe waiving of Columbus City Code 329 is in the best interest of the City as the pricing structure set by Syngenta Golf Course pesticide supplier requires the same pricing to be offered by each local vendor. An Informal cost proposal has been submitted by Harrell’s in the amount of $269,981.60.  This purchase makes us eligible for a rebate totaling $54,958.49.  \n \nHarrell’s is the current supplier for golf fertilizers & pesticides and has provided the product in a timely and accurate manner with no concerns or issues to the end user.\n \nWith the changes to the pesticide application program in 2017, the Golf Division has been able to reduce the number of applications and product while producing noticeable results with improved playing conditions.    \n \nBid Waiver Justification:  Syngenta offers a fall purchasing program to its vendors that packages pesticides into bundles and offers deep discounts and rebates and sets pricing for all distributors resulting in equal pricing between distributors.  In order to take advantage of Syngenta’s fall purchasing program, the order must be placed by December 2024 to be eligible.  \n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency is being requested in order to meet the fall order purchasing program deadline of December, 2024, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety\n \nBenefits to the Public: Golfers benefit by having better turf utilization of safer pesticides providing excellent course conditions, a great product for the customer.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Airport, Mentel, Champions, Raymond, Turnberry, and Wilson Golf Courses.\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  The Golf Courses continue to support the mission of the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by ensuring a strong customer base with successful on-going revenue producing operations.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nHarrell’s LLC\n5105 New Tampa Highway\nLakeland, FL 33815\nVendor #020552\n \nFiscal Impact: $269,981.60 is budgeted and available from and within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 to meet the financial obligations of these expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Harrell's, LLC for the purchase of Golf Course pesticides for the Recreation and Parks Department; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $269,981.60 for the purchase of golf turf pesticides from the Recreation and Parks Operating fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($269,981.60)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Harrell's LLC for the purchase of pesticides in an amount not to exceed $269,981.60 for the purchase of Golf course pesticides on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 to purchase directly from Harrell’s as part of Syngenta program using pre-established vendors offering the same pricing structure; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $269,981.60 from the Recreation and Parks Department Operating Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Harrell's, LLC for golf course pesticides in order to meet the fall order purchasing program deadline of December, 2024, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That, for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $269,981.60, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the cost thereof, be and is hereby authorized from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund No. 2285 in object class 02 (Supplies) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten (10) days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
