    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\n \nA boundary adjustment between the City of Columbus and the City of Upper Arlington has been proposed. The site is right-of-way along the Henderson Rd corridor from roughly Moreland Drive West to the east, to just beyond Chevy Chase Court to the west. The proposed adjustment moves the City of Columbus corporate boundary northward along Henderson Road. The transfer will place the entirety of the right-of-way within the City of Upper Arlington. \n \nThis legislation is being filed in response to the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code - section 709.37 regarding municipal boundary adjustments.  Parallel legislation is anticipated by the City of Upper Arlington City Council. Columbus approval will allow the adjustment proposal to be submitted to Franklin County for finalization. \n \nFiscal Impact: \n \nNone\n \nTitle\n \nTo agree to an adjustment to the City’s boundaries by consenting to transfer approximately 12.47+/- acres from the City of Columbus to the City of Upper Arlington. \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, 12.47+/- acres of territory from roughly Moreland Drive West to the east, to just beyond Chevy Chase Court to the west, is located within the City of Columbus and is adjacent to territory within the City of Upper Arlington; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of all parties if the boundaries of the two communities reflect the proposed adjustment; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is the desire of the City of Columbus to transfer the subject area to the City of Upper Arlington which desires to accept said transfer; and \n \nWHEREAS, the proposed transfer does not involve the transfer of territory inhabited by more than five voters; now, therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\n \nSEE \"SECTION\" ATTACHMENT",
