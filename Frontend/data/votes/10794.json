    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to issue purchase orders to Stryker Sales Corporation, and ZOLL Medical Corporation for the purchase of Fire and EMS equipment for the Alternative Emergency Response Vehicles (AVR).  \nThe Division of Fire purchased five (5) AVR transport vehicles (medics) from Atlantic Emergency Solutions for the implementation of alternative emergency response vehicle deployment.  The Division of Fire has an immediate need to upfit the five (5) AVR’s with Stryker EMS equipment, including five (5) Power Load Cots and five (5) Stair Chairs into the new medics and ZOLL Medical supplies, including five (5) Refurbished X Series Monitor/Defibrillators to meet original bid specification (RFQ025981.) \nBID INFORMATION:  Stryker Sales Corporation ~ FID #382902424 / Vendor 030281 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase of five (5) Stryker Stair Chairs - Pro Model 6252 with footrest and head support and one year Stair Chair ProCare.  The Division of Fire also requests the purchase of five (5) Stryker Ambulance Power Cots/Loaders with wheel guide, 6507 power pro-2, battery charger, power cord, Lithium-ion battery with one-year Powerload ProCare for use in the aforementioned AVR’s in the total amount of $362,214.80.  In the past these cots have been included in the specifications along with other EMS equipment that comes on the EMS vehicles.  However, buying directly from the manufacturer will result in a significant savings to the City.  A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329 is necessary for this purchase as the Stryker Stair Chair and Power Cot/Loaders are the standardized ambulance cot deployed by the Division of Fire, making it impractical to bid given Stryker is the sole distributor for this proprietary equipment.\nZOLL Medical Corporation ~ FID #042711626 / Vendor #000197 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase of five (5) refurbished X Series Monitor/Defibrillators - 12 Lead ECG, Pacing, NIBP, SpO2, SpCO, SPMet, EtCO2, CPR Expansion Packs with cuff kit, rechargeable battery, charger, reusable EMS patient cables, reusable sensor with connector and 4G Global modem in the amount of $112,152.40.  A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329 is necessary for this purchase as the ZOLL Monitor/Defibrillators are the standardized ambulance equipment deployed by the Division of Fire, making it impractical to bid. Also, when the ARV’s were purchases with RFQ025981 it was stated that the Division of Fire was required to supply these specific items. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested for the EMS equipment to avoid delays in purchasing due to potential supply chain shortages.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $474,367.20 for the upfit needed on Columbus Fire Division five (5) AVR’s to place them into service.  Funds are available within the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Safety Bond Fund, Fund 7701.  An appropriation and a transfer of cash and appropriation is required to fund this project. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is also necessary.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Safety Bond Fund; to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize an appropriation of $352,670.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund; to authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Department of Public Safety, to enter into contracts with and issue purchase orders to Stryker Sales Corporation for the purchase of Stair Chairs and Power Cots and Loaders in the amount of $362,214.80, and ZOLL Medical Corporation for the purchase of refurbished X Series Monitor/Defibrillators in the amount of $112,152.40; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $352,670.00 from the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and $121,697.20 from the Safety Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
