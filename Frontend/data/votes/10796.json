    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance enacts a new chapter of the Columbus City Codes to create the Commission on Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.\n \nImmigrants and refugees are vibrant and vital to the City of Columbus. Immigrants contribute to the economic development of this city and we have long seen an impact in our historic neighborhoods like German Village, Italian Village, and Hungarian Village. As thousands have resettled and continue to resettle here, they often face barriers or are unable to access resources. \n \nThe Commission on Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will advise the Council on issues of common concern to immigrants, particularly in the areas of health and human services, education, and the demographic makeup of the Columbus immigrant/refugee community.\n \nThe Commission on Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will consist of 15 members who are immigrants or refugees or the children of immigrants or refugees. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo enact Chapter 175 of the Columbus City Codes, to create the Commission on Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, immigrants and refugees are vibrant and vital to the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus metropolitan area, or Central Ohio, is home to nearly 185,000 immigrants, making up about 8.7% of the population.
