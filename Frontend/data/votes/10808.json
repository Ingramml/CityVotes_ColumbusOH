    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize and Celebrate the 3rd Year Anniversary of Opportunity Port\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Opportunity Port is an online record sealing and expungement application assistance program managed by The Ohio State University Drug Enforcement and Policy Center aimed at removing barriers to record relief for justice involved residents of Franklin County, Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, An estimated 1 in 3 Ohio adults has a criminal record and the collateral consequences stemming from criminal records present significant economic and social barriers to resources and opportunities such as housing, employment, public benefits, and professional licensing; and\n \nWHEREAS, Minority communities are disproportionately impacted by criminal records, the consequences of which contribute to racial inequality and perpetuate systemic inequities; and\n \nWHEREAS, Research from the University of Michigan Law School has shown that those who obtain expungement have extremely low recidivism rates and experience a sharp upturn in their wage and employment trajectories; and\n \nWHEREAS, Opportunity Port began as a Columbus City Council initiative and was awarded funding by Schmidt Futures through The Ohio State University Alliance for the American Dream competition; and\n \nWHEREAS, The program moved to the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center at the Moritz College of Law in July of 2021 and continued to develop under the center’s leadership; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Drug Enforcement and Policy Center launched the Franklin County pilot on December 1, 2021, and expanded program operations to serve all Ohio residents with Ohio criminal records on January 1, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, Opportunity Port’s Franklin County service providers are the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center, the Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio, Equality Ohio, and the Franklin County Municipal Court Self Help Center; and\n \nWHEREAS, Collectively, these service providers have assisted over 1,000 Franklin County residents with determining eligibility for record sealing or expungement and filed applications on behalf of 767 county residents; and \n \nWHEREAS, The evolution of Ohio’s sealing and expungement laws has resulted in a greater number of individuals eligible for record relief; and\n \nWHEREAS, Opportunity Port is a much-needed addition to the city and state’s legal services environment and the continued success of this sealing and expungement program is vital to ensuring Columbus residents with criminal records have a pathway to economic and social prosperity; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nThat this Council recognizes and celebrates the 3rd Year Anniversary of Opportunity Port, and the dedication of those who work to aid in its mission.",
