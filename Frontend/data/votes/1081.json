The CFTF will provide $375,000.00 total over three years to organizations that meet specified legal services needs within the immigrant and refugee communities, with $375,000.00 allocated by the City of Columbus.\nColumbus City Council solicited proposals from nonprofit legal service providers in the Central Ohio area to receive grants totaling $75,000.00 towards legal services that help keep families together in the Central Ohio immigrant and refugee communities.\nFour grant applications were received for the Additional Legal Services Grant fund. A review committee of five immigration experts reviewed the grant applications and recommended that Columbus City Council award $37,500.00 to the Our Lady of Guadalupe Center of Catholic Social Services.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund.\nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide resources to Our Lady of Guadalupe to avoid any disruption in legal services for immigrant and refugee families.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Our Lady of Guadalupe Center of Catholic Social Services for the purpose of providing legal services for immigrant and refugee families in relation to Columbus Families Together Fund; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
