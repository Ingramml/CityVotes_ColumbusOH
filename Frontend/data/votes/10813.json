    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to modify an existing not-for-profit service contract with OARnet/OSU by extending the contract end date from April 2, 2026 to July 30, 2027. Ordinance 3005-2023, passed by City Council on November 13, 2023 authorized entering into a two-year contract with OARnet/OSU, beginning on April 2, 2024 and ending on April 1, 2026. This ordinance extends that contract through July 30, 2027, at an additional cost of $596,791.16 to ensure on-going service provision.\n \nDoT contracts with OARnet/OSU, a non-profit organization, for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support services. The original contract (EL011737) was authorized by ordinance 1716-2010, passed on December 13, 2010. This contract was most recently authorized with passage of ordinance 3005-2023 on November 13, 2023.\n \nServer virtualization is the conversion of one physical server into multiple individual and isolated virtual storage spaces. This industry standard was adopted by the DoT in 2009 to reduce the costs of Data Center operations. This also reduces power consumption, cooling requirements, and provides further capabilities for recovery and availability of information systems. VMWare software is the core component that is needed in order to operate virtual servers that run critical applications for the enterprise such as Accela, CUBS, and 311.\n \nMODIFICATION\n1.1.                     Amount of additional funds to be expended - This modification will add $596,791.16 to the existing contract and extends it through July 30, 2027.\n1.2                     Reason need for modification could not be foreseen - It was recently determined that there was a need for additional services to address recent needs.\n1.3                     Reason other procurement processes were not used - Through the State of Ohio Virtualization Program, OARnet offers significant discounts on VMWare that are not available in the market place. As such, it is in the city’s best interests to procure VMWare through OARnet, rather than another procurement process. The pricing offered to the city reflects the agreed upon public sector discounts available to all participants in the State of Ohio Virtualization Program.\n1.4                     How cost modification was determined - quote submitted by vendor.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract modification are budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services operating fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: OARnet/OSU\nVendor #: 006163\nExpiration Date: 3-29-2025\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify and extend an existing contract with OARnet/OSU for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support, pursuant to Columbus City Codes sections relating to not-for-profit service contracts; and to authorize the expenditure of $596,791.16 from the Department of Technology Information Services Operating Fund.
