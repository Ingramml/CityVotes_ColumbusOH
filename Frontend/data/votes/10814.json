    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify a contract with CBRE Government Services, LLC (CBRE) for facility management services at the Franklin County Municipal Court Building. Since 2007, the Department of Finance and Management has contracted for facility management services for the Franklin County Municipal Court Building at 375 S. High Street. \n \nCBRE is responsible for regularly assessing the conditions of the building and its systems, developing and implementing building operations (including janitorial and security services), performing preventive maintenance, and establishing capital plans necessary to maintain, preserve, and keep the premises in good repair and condition. At the City’s request, CBRE may also act as a liaison and assist in the oversight of the design and build out of building renovations and improvements at these facilities. \n \nThis modification is necessary to add additional funding to and extend the term of the facility management agreement. It is necessary to extend the term of the contract through May 2025 to allow for the Department of Finance and Management to bid out these services via a Best Value Proposal solicitation. The current contract period ends on December 31, 2024.  A Best Value Procurement solicitation to award a new contract was expected to be administered by the Purchasing Office prior to the end of the current contract term.  Due to unexpected delays, the solicitation will not be administered until early 2025, thus the need to modify the current contract to allow for service to continue until the new contract can be awarded.  The vendor agreed to continue the previously agreed upon 2024 monthly facility management and operational expenses pricing for this modification.\n \nThe initial term of this contract was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 1223-2019 and was for the period June 1, 2019 - May 31, 2020, with four (4) annual renewal options.  The first contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 0873-2020 and was for the period June 1, 2020 - May 31, 2021.  A contract modification was done to add additional funds in the amount of $270,000 pursuant to ordinance 2100-2020.  The second contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 0908-2021 and was for the period June 1, 2021 - May 31, 2022. The third renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 0653-2022 and was for the period June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2023.  A contract modification was done for additional funds in the amount of $160,000.00, pursuant to Ordinance 3171-2022.  The fourth (4th) and final contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 1258-2023 for the period June 1, 2023 - May 31, 2024.  A contract modification was done for additional funds in the amount of $208,973.00, pursuant to Ordinance 3114-2023.  A contract modification was done for additional funds of $984,682.00 and extended the period to December 31, 2024, pursuant to Ordinance 0863-2024.\n \nThe cost break-down for the additional funding needed for this facility management services at the Municipal Court Building are as follows: \n \nFacility Management -  $263,719.00\nOperational Expenses - $439.625.00 \n \nCBRE Government Services, LLC Federal Tax ID: 80-0659792, CC027385 \n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of up to $703,344.00 within the General Fund with CBRE Government Services, LLC for facility management services at the Franklin County Municipal Court Building.\n \nOrdinance 1258-2023 authorized the expenditure of $1,633,828.00 for these facility management services.
