Main Street was redeveloped into a multi-use facility containing offices, co-working spaces, retail shops, event space, an amphitheater, café, fitness center, business incubators, as well as technology and vocational training facilities.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nColumbus Center of Entrepreneurial Development’s vendor number is 042945 and contract compliance is pending.\n \nFISCAL IMPACTS\nFunding in the amount of $500,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Development Taxable Bonds Fund, Fund (7739).
