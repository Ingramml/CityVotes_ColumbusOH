    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify contracts with Ohio Machinery Co., formerly known as Esec Corporation dba Columbus Peterbilt, for the purchase of two single axle dump trucks with snow equipment for the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management in an amount of up to $207,248.34.\n \nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management, is responsible for maintaining Columbus roadways. This includes filling potholes, street sweeping, mowing, alley resurfacing, and snow and ice removal.  Ordinance 2084-2021 authorized the purchase of two single axle dump trucks with snow equipment for the purpose of maintaining the roads at a cost of $195,885.83 per truck.  The City had a multiple year Universal Term Contract established for dump trucks with Ohio Machinery Co., PA004939, which was updated to PA005655. \n \nAfter ordinance 2084-2021 authorized the purchase of two single axle dump trucks with snow equipment and the trucks were delivered, Ohio Machinery Co. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to supply chain issues resulting from long lead times for production and delivery in the post-pandemic market place, a surcharge of $103,624.17 per truck was necessary due to raw material and component price increases from manufactures and their suppliers.  The Department of Public Service feels these changes are acceptable and the vehicles offered by Ohio Machinery Co. will meet the needs of the Department.\n \n1.1                     Amount of additional funds to be expended:     $207,248.34\nOriginal contract amount:                                                                                            $391,771.66                     (PO292870, Ord 2084-2021)  \nThe total of Modification 1:                                                                                        $207,248.34                     (This Ordinance)                     \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $599,020.00 \n \n1.2                     Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe pandemic affected timelines for truck builds due to the purchasing components needed, and timelines were subject to global availability.  Pricing continued to fluctuate across industries during these extended timelines due to lack of availability of components and raw materials.\n \n1.3                     Reasons other procurement processes are not used:  \nSpecialized truck builds take over one year to build, which is dependent on the order date and place in the ordering queue.  The order had been placed and the trucks delivered; thus, cancelling the order would add an additional 1 to 2 years to the order timeline, during which time prices would likely increase further.  Additionally, the aging fleet of operational dump trucks makes it necessary to purchase the trucks now so they can be used this winter for snow and ice operations.\n \n1.4                     How the cost of the modification was determined: \nThe additional surcharges were determined by industry pricing documents provided by the manufacturer’s suppliers, showing increased costs in raw materials and components.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Ohio Machinery Co., formerly known as Esec Corporation dba Columbus Peterbilt.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Ohio Machinery Co., formerly known as Esec Corporation dba Columbus Peterbilt, is CC006428 and expires 5/8/2026.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are budgeted and available for this expenditure from the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund (Fund 2266).  Transfer of appropriation from 02 to 06 is necessary for this purchase.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThese expenditures are being made from Universal Term Contracts established for use by the City’s Purchasing Office and as such do not require MWBE goals to be established.\n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe department requests emergency designation so this equipment can be put into service as quickly as possible to prevent interruption to, or disruption of, the Division of Infrastructure Management Snow and Ice winter operations. \n \nTitle \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to modify contracts with Ohio Machinery Co. to allow for raw material and component surcharges for two trucks; to authorize the transfer of appropriation within the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $207,248.34 from the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund; and to declare an emergency.
