    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up an auditor’s certificate in the amount of $140,000.00 for the purchase of trees and nursery stock for the Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD). These expenditures are from a citywide Universal Term Contract (UTC) for trees and nursery stock established by the Purchasing Office in the Department of Finance and Management. This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of more than $100,000.00 from an individual UTC by a single agency in a calendar year in compliance with the procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329. This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance to the current UTC purchase agreements for the purchase of trees and nursery stock and establish contracts as needed.  \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has a need to purchase trees and nursery stock for the City nursery operated by Forestry staff. The Department of Finance and Management has established a UTC with Acorn Farms Inc, per PA005814, for the purchase of trees and shrubs. CRPD has establish two purchase orders from the UTC, referenced as PO432183 and PO435612, and relieved a total of $34,685 in Fiscal Year 2024. CRPD expects to incur single-year expenditures that exceed $100,000.00 from purchase orders established in accordance the Acorn Farms Inc. UTC. The total annual expenditures projected in Fiscal Year 2024, for the purchase of trees and nursery stock, is approximately $174,685.00 for the Recreation and Parks Department. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nAcorn Farms Inc.\n7679 Worthington Road\nGalena, Ohio 43021\nContract Compliance Number: 004555\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: December 27, 2025\n \nBenefits to the Public: Trees provide tangible benefits to Columbus residents. As the 15th largest city in the nation, Columbus is home to over 900,000 people. Columbus had the 8th most intense urban heat island effect of major US cities, impacting health, energy use, and water quality. The recently published Columbus Climate Action Plan recommends planting trees as a solution. Street trees are the workhorses as they clean our air, reduce heat, and absorb stormwater. In an Ohio summer, trees provide the shade that makes walking outside bearable. Trees should be equitably distributed across the City so all residents benefit.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Hundreds of stakeholders helped create the Urban Forestry Master Plan. Industry experts, universities, nonprofits, developers, community leaders, city staff, regional partners, landscape architects, and many others served on two stakeholder groups consisting of a Project Team of about 30 members and an Advisory Group of about 100 members. All members are listed in the Acknowledgments section of the UFMP and on the UFMP website The UFMP website is located at www.columbusufmp.org. These groups met periodically throughout the course of the plan’s creation to provide input. The public was also engaged through an online survey, an open house, small-group presentations, and interviews.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the city’s natural resources and overall environmental health. The UFMP will benefit current and future generations.\n \nFiscal Impact: $140,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Tree Fund 2234 to meet the financial obligations of these expenditures. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish an auditor’s certificate in the amount of $140,000.00 for the purchase of trees and nursery stock for the Recreation and Parks Department; to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance to current and future purchase agreements for trees and nursery stock and establish purchase orders in accordance with the terms and conditions of the citywide universal term contract with Acorn Farms, Inc.; to authorize the expenditure of more than $100,000.00 from an individual universal term contract by a single agency in a calendar year in compliance with the procurement provisions of the Columbus City Code; and to authorize the expenditure of $140,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Tree Fund.
