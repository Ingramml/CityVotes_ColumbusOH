    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC to develop 23 units of new construction rental housing in zip code 43211. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation will allow the Director to enter into a Housing Development Agreement with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC, which will ultimately be funded with $5,000,000.00 from the 2024 Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond. When the capital funds become available, an ordinance will be brought to Council to authorize a grant agreement.\n \nHealthy Homes is a non-profit affordable housing developer, affiliated with Community Development for All People and Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  It is focused on increasing the stock of high-quality housing options available to families earning no more than 80% of Area Median Income (AMI) in Linden. Healthy Linden Homes V LLC seeks to further address Columbus’s housing affordability issues by developing 23 units of new construction rental housing in zip code 43211. These properties will consist of infill development, designed to replace residential structures that have been demolished.\n \nThe 23 rental units for which funding is sought will consist of 11 single family homes and 6 duplexes. Eleven of these properties will be built by Unibilt Industries-a modular home builder located in Dayton, Ohio. The modular units will be delivered approximately 75% complete and set on full foundations. Healthy Homes, the developer, has engaged General Contractors who will complete all site preparations, construct the foundations and manage the balance of work post-delivery. Once delivered, the units will require mechanical connections for electric, plumbing and HVAC. Porches will be constructed on site, and there will be some minor interior finishes to finalize. Lastly, the General Contractor will pour concrete parking pads and walk ways, and each site will be fully landscaped with sod and a shade tree. The units that are not modular are traditional stick construction. Upon completion, these projects will blend with the existing fabric of the community, and there will be no visible evidence to suggest that they are modular in nature.\n \nIn addition to high-quality, affordable places to call home, the tenant families who will reside in these units will have access to a variety of supportive services and advocacy opportunities. Healthy Homes links residents to health/social service providers and Nationwide Children’s Healthy Neighborhoods Healthy Families (HNHF) programming. More specifically, tenants will have improved access to health, educational, workforce, and life skills development opportunities. Financial literacy, parenting classes, and mental health services will also be emphasized. Service engagement will not be required for Healthy Homes’ families, but it will be available to all households as needed.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is needed.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 050785 and expires October 30, 2026.\n...Title\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC to develop 23 units of new construction rental housing in zip code 43211. ($0.00)\n \n...Body\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development seeks to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC; and\n \nWHEREAS, the HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and future availability of funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing\n$5,000,000.00 of bond funds from a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation would authorize the Director of Development to first execute the HDA and pending the availability of funding from a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond and the department will seek City Council’s approval to enter into a grant agreement; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Director of the Department of Development is authorized to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC.\n \nSECTION 2. That this ordinance shall take effect at the earliest date allowable by law.",
