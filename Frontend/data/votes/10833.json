    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Office of CelebrateOne was awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Medicaid which is administered by the State’s Managed Care Plans. Ordinance 1723-2022, passed by Columbus City Council included $200,000.00 for a doula expansion program in order to fund a training program in order to expand the number of doulas within the Central Ohio area. This ordinance funds the second contract of $100,000.00 to begin training doulas.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to execute a service contract with National Center for Urban Solutions, TEC dba NCUS TEC. and R.O.O.T.T. (RESTORING OUR OWN THROUGH TRANSFORMATION), which in collaboration with R.O.OT.T. to launch an advanced perinatal support doula training program. .\n \nEach year, more than 130 babies die in Franklin County before reaching their first birthday. Over 2,000 more are born prematurely. Franklin County’s African American families are disproportionately impacted by infant mortality, experiencing an infant mortality rate 2.5 times higher than non-Hispanic white families in Columbus. Therefore, resources and tools must be geared towards these geographic and cultural communities. \n \nTo combat this tremendous threat of our families and communities, the Greater Columbus Infant Mortality Task Force of 2014 was assembled to develop community recommendations and an implementation plan. That plan set goals to reduce the community’s alarming infant mortality rate by 40 percent and cut the racial health disparity gap in half by 2020 with eight recommendations for how our community could achieve these goals. That plan has served as the guiding light for the work of CelebrateOne and its many partners. CelebrateOne has made tremendous progress in implementing the plan’s recommendations and strategies and, ultimately, achieving the plan’s goals. Racial disparities in birth outcomes remain high and the global COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated systemic barriers faced by families most at risk for poor birth outcomes while simultaneously creating new obstacles for providers and partners to provide care.  \n \nNCUS TEC. and R.O.OT.T. are joining forces to launch an advanced perinatal support doula training program, designed to address critical gaps in maternal and infant care. This partnership will harness NCUS TEC., a non-profit corporation and  R.O.O.T.T. (RESTORING OUR OWN THROUGH TRANSFORMATION), a non-profit corporation have expertise in technical education and R.O.OT.T. deep knowledge of culturally competent doula training, specifically focusing on improving outcomes in Black maternal and infant health. The program will include comprehensive modules on prenatal, birth, and postpartum care, lactation support, advocacy, trauma-informed care, and the social determinants of health, all tailored to the unique challenges faced by Black women and their families. By combining NCUS TEC. educational infrastructure with R.O.OT.T. subject matter expertise, the program aims to cultivate a new generation of doulas equipped to provide holistic, culturally responsive care in under-resourced communities.NCUS TEC. This doula training program cannot be completed by the existing CelebrateOne staff as the staffing level is not adequate to conduct this expansion of doula training services. \n \nNCUS TEC.  is a Not-For-Profit Organization, TAX ID #852989509, DAX#025982 and R.O.O.T.T.
