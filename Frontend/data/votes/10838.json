    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement in an amount up to $50,000.00 with Community Housing Network, Inc., one of six not-for-profit social service agencies that were awarded within the 2024 Flourish Grant as part of the department’s Elevate! program. Additional ordinances will be forthcoming as part of this award for the other agencies.  The total awarded to each agency is an amount up to $50,000.00 for a total award amount of $280,000.00 for the program.  The term of each Grant Agreement shall be from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025.\n \nOn June 24, 2024, the Department of Development disseminated the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for the 2024 Flourish Grant, to the 112 Non-Profit agencies within the Elevate! Grant Program. The NOFA extended an invitation to these organizations to collaborate and apply for grants of up to $50,000.00 for fostering innovative partnerships to improve and strengthen the non-profits’ capacities which then will better serve their clients. The NOFA specified there was a total of $230,000.00 available. Later, $50,000.00 in additional funding was reallocated to the Department of Development, expanding the total funds available to $280,000.00.\n \nIn response, a total of fifteen proposals involving 32 non-profit organizations were received, collectively requesting $716,407.00. These submissions were subsequently narrowed down to 6, and each collaborating partner was invited to present their ideas during FlourishFest '24. This three-day event provided a platform for each collaboration to pitch their proposals and receive feedback from an audience comprising reviewers, fellow applicants, and guests. Each collaboration was instructed to incorporate that feedback into their final proposals, which were due on August 30, 2024. An eleven-member review team was assembled and tasked with evaluating and scoring these proposals.\n \nThe proposal received from Community Housing Network, in collaboration with Furniture Bank of Central Ohio, was one of the six proposals selected by the review team to be funded by this initiative. The agencies will work together to provide furnishings for CHN new residents and ensure a comprehensive support system beyond mere housing. The proposed funding will be allocated directly to Community Housing Network but will be utilized by both agencies involved to further their collaboration and provide services to their constituents. The grant will allow the grantee to receive up to 10% of the award towards administrative costs.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is needed to assure that funding is in place by the start of the grant, January 1, 2025, in order to provide a support system for our city’s vulnerable populations.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this expenditure is allocated within the Elevate! Program’s General Fund budget, in an amount up to $50,000.00. ($50,000.00)\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 004867 and the expiration date is 04/03/2025\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $50,000.00 with Community Housing Network, Inc., one of six not-for-profit, social service agencies awarded funding, for the provision of human services programming for a 12 month period from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, as part of the 2024 Flourish Grant; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; to authorize the expenditure of up to $50,000.00 from the Elevate!
