    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to pay the State of Ohio, Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), penalties for combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, and wastewater treatment plant bypasses that occur in 2024 and 2025. \n \nThe City’s sewer system occasionally experiences combined sewer (CSO) or sanitary sewer overflows (SSO) due to wet weather and dry weather events. Wet weather events are more common and often due to heavy rains, while dry weather occurrences are due to collection system blockages often caused by roots or debris. Bypasses are overflows or untreated releases into the environment. The City and the State of Ohio entered into Consent Orders in 2002 and 2004 to address concerns related to bypasses and each type of overflow.\n \nOverflows and bypasses are often weather-dependent, which makes occurrences vary from year-to-year. For example, 2023 was a relatively wet year. 2024 has been a relatively dry year.\n \n \nThe Consent Orders stipulate fines to be paid for CSO and SSOs, the amount of which depends on the type and number of event. These parameters are shown in the table below: \n \n\n\n\nEvent\n\nAmount Per Event\n\nDue Date\n\n\n\nDry Weather SSO\n\n$1,500\n\nMarch 1st, each year\n\n\n\nWet Weather SSO\n\n \n\nMarch 1st, each year\n\n\n\n            1-250 events\n\n$2,500\n\n \n\n\n\n        251-500 events\n\n$12,500\n\n \n\n\n\n           > 500 events\n\n$20,000\n\n \n\n\n\nSoutherly Bypass\n\n$2,000\n\nMarch 1st, each year\n\n\n\nDry Weather CSO\n\n$2,000\n\nWithin 45 days of event\n\n\n\nJackson Pike Bypass\n\n$2,000\n\nWithin 45 days of event\n\n\n \nSUPPLIER: \n \nTreasurer of State of Ohio, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency| D365 Vendor #005089 | Governmental Entity\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$60,000.00 is needed and budgeted to pay these fines.\n \n$36,500.00 has been paid so far in 2024 as of 10/18/2024 \n$58,000.00 was paid in 2023\n$10,000 was paid in 2022\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to pay combined sewer overflows, sanitary sewer overflows, and wastewater treatment plant bypass penalties to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage; and to authorize the expenditure of $60,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund.
