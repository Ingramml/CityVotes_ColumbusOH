    "description": "aExplanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Ethosoft, Inc., via the RFP process, for professional services and installation services for the Division of Water (DOW) and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) Lab Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade project, CIP No. 650665-100000 and CIP No.690572-100001, in an amount up to $110,000.00. This amount covers the cost of software support and licenses during implementation of the software described below.\n \nThe City operates a Division of Water (DOW) Water Quality Assurance Laboratory (WQAL) and Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) Surveillance Laboratory.  Currently each lab has a different process for information management, both of which are outdated and don’t meet the workflows of the labs.  This project will provide a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for both labs to meet the current and future needs of these laboratories and to maintain regulatory compliance.  Implementation of the LIMS program in both labs will streamline information input, usage, and reporting for regulatory compliance.  Both labs are essential and integral components in the City of Columbus water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water and wastewater treatment is essential to economic growth.\n \nThis project will provide configuration, installation implementation, training, and annual ongoing licensing, maintenance, and support of the LIMS software.  This contract will incorporate the implementation of the LIMS system and five years of licensing and support of the LIMS software.  Licensing and software support will need to continue after this initial five-year period for the remaining life of the system.  It is anticipated this continuing support will be done in new five-year contracts and awarded through a waiver of the City’s competitive bidding process due to licensing and software support only being available through a single company.  \n \nOrdinance 3098-2023 authorized the Department of Public Utilities to enter into contracts Ethosoft, Inc., for the DOSD and DOW Lab Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade project.  The work on the initial contract was to be reimbursed to the City via a loan obtained from the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program.  At the time of that ordinance it was thought all expenses for the project were eligible to be covered under the loan from OWDA and a second contract would be established with a different funding source to pay for the ongoing operating costs of the contract.  It is now necessary to implement the second contract to pay for items that OWDA has determined are not eligible to be loan funded under the first contract.  This second contract will be modified at a future time to pay for ongoing licensing and support.   \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE:  It is anticipated this project will have two contracts for the initial term of this project.  One contract will cover implementation of the LIMS System and the first year of licensing and software support.  The term of this contract will be from issuance of a Notice to Proceed authorizing the start of work to final acceptance of the system by the City.  The second contract will start when the licensing and software support for the first contract ends and covers the next four years of licensing and support.      \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The price of the LIMS implementation and licensing and software support for the first five years of the system life has been established and set as shown below in the Original Contracts amount.  Additional funds are not anticipated to be needed for the original contracts.  The City will need ongoing licensing and support for the life of the LIMS software that will extend beyond the terms of the initial contracts.  That pricing is unknown at this time and will be negotiated and legislated for the implementation of the next licensing and support contract.  \n                     \n                                                   \n                                               First Year Contract’s Needs                                                                                   $           110,000.00\n                                                                       Future Anticipated Needs (TBD)                                                                            $                     0.00\n                                                                       CONTRACTS TOTAL                                                                                          $           110,000.00\n \n2.   ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nCurrently each lab has a different process for information management, both of which are outdated and don’t meet the work flows of the labs.  Implementation of the LIMS program in both labs will streamline information input, usage, and reporting for regulatory compliance.  Both labs are essential and integral components in the City of Columbus water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water and wastewater treatment is essential to economic growth.  Public informational meetings are not anticipated for this project.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nEthosoft, Inc.’s contract compliance is CC044120 with an expiration date of 11/17/2025. \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 0% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Ethosoft is classified by ODI as a Majority company and does not have plans to use a subconsultant for this contract.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this contract is anticipated to be 0%.    \n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Water Bond Fund and the Sanitary Bond Fund \n \nA transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, in the amount of $55,000.00, and a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, in the amount of $55,000.00, are needed to fund this contract.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order for the funding to be available to make expenditure corrections prior to the end of the fiscal year to ensure accurate accounting records.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Ethosoft, Inc. for the DOSD and DOW Lab Information Management System Upgrade project; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund and within the Sanitary Bond Fund; to expend up to $55,000.00 each from the Water Bond Fund and from the Sanitary Bond Fund for the contract;
