The Easement burdens real property located in the vicinity of Slade Avenue and Binghampton Place, Columbus, Ohio 43235 (“Servient Estate”) currently owned by Braxton on Bethel, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company. The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed a request by the owner of the Servient Estate to vacate a 0.136 acre portion of the existing Easement and determined that the portion of the Easement is no longer needed as a new storm sewer was recorded in Instrument Number 201602050014968. DPU has determined that terminating the City’s rights to the portion of the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \n...Title\n \nTo authorize the director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release a portion the City’s storm sewer easement rights described and recorded in Deed Book 3678, Page 14, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
