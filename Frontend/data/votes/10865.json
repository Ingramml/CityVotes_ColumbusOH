    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate purchase agreement (PA) with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing and “true-up.” Microsoft Office is the city’s technology standard for desktop computing software, currently used by approximately 7,800 city employees in their daily business. The city also utilizes Microsoft software to support various enterprise applications. This ordinance will enable the city to obtain the latest versions of Microsoft software utilizing a single agreement for the entire city.\n \nOn September 21, 2023, the Department of Finance’s Purchasing Office published RFQ025795 to solicit quotes for a new three-year Microsoft Enterprise purchase agreement. Three submissions were received: Brown Enterprise Solutions, Dell Technologies, and GovConnect. The Purchasing Office recommended that the PA be awarded to Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC as the overall lowest, responsive, responsible, and best bidder. The term of this contract is three years, beginning on December 31, 2023, and ending on December 31, 2026. Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC is an authorized reseller of various Microsoft products, including those described above.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes appropriating $2,852,156.40 from the unappropriated balance of the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund to the Department of Technology for the above-described purpose.\n \nFinally, this ordinance also authorizes the total expenditure of $3,033,499.47. Of this total, $53,800.00 is funded by the Information Services operating fund, Public Utilities direct charge allocation; $127,543.07 is funded by the 2024 general fund appropriation of the Franklin County Municipal Court; and the balance of $2,852,156.40 is funded by the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the above-mentioned purchases are budgeted and available in the 2024 appropriations of the above-mentioned funds. \n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to so that a purchase order is issued prior to the City Auditor’s end-of-year deadline of December 23, 2024, and to process payment due on the new Microsoft Enterprise licenses contract by January 1, 2025, from the supplier at the price offered. Failure to do so will jeopardize access to the various Microsoft applications that are used daily in the city.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nBrown Enterprise Solutions, LLC; Vendor, CC#010668, expires 2/2/2026\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate purchase agreement with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, an approved reseller of Microsoft products, for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing and “true-up” costs; to appropriate $2,852,156.40 from the unappropriated balance of the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund to the Department of Technology; to authorize the expenditure of $53,800.00 from the Information Services operating fund, $127,543.07 from the Municipal Court Judges general fund budget, and $2,852,156.40 from the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund; and to declare an emergency.
