    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance provides $2,259,442.19 for construction inspection and administration deficits for capital improvement projects within the Department of Public Service.  Additionally, this ordinance provides additional funds for projects with the Department to prevent future deficits.\n \nConstruction Inspection funding is normally authorized in construction legislation and available throughout the project.  The amount for inspection is generally estimated by taking a percentage of the construction cost.  Occasionally the funds set-up for this estimated cost are not sufficient to cover the inspection of the project through completion due to project unforeseen conditions, weather, construction change orders, etc.  It is then necessary to request additional funding for the remaining inspection costs.  \n \nThe funds requested by this ordinance will be used to supplement inspection and administration costs on projects that would have incurred a small deficit without the availability of these funds.  The Department of Public Service usually performs an assessment of the remaining funding for inspection and administration for all projects two times a year.  Separate legislation is submitted requesting Council approval for additional construction inspection and administration funds for projects that have or are projected to run large deficits before the completion of construction.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for these expenses are available within the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget.   An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned project expenditures.  Funds are appropriated.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer cash and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the establishment of an Auditor’s Certificate for construction inspection and administration fees; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,259,442.19 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the purpose of providing sufficient funding for construction inspection and administration services on Public Service projects. ($2,259,442.19)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, capital improvement projects undertaken by Departments within the City of Columbus generally include an inspection component; and\n \nWHEREAS, the amount encumbered for inspection is ordinarily an estimate based on the project's construction expense; and\n \nWHEREAS, the actual inspection amounts charged are subject to many variables including but not limited to unforeseen conditions, weather, construction change orders, and so on; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to encumber additional funds for some of these projects that have or are projected to exceed the funds originally set up in legislation for construction inspection; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned project expenditures; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize a transfer of funds within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, to establish sufficient cash to pay for the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to establish an Auditor’s Certificate for projects that exceed the funds originally set-up in legislation for construction inspection and administration; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.   That the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget authorized by ordinance 1907-2024 be amended as follows to establish  sufficient authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project / Project Name / C.I.B. / Change / C.I.B. as Amended\n7704 / P530282-100051 / Resurfacing -
