    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to expend up to $85,000.00 to facilitate and support the mobilization and deployment of Duncan Sales, Inc. dba City Wide Facility Solutions (Columbus) for the provision of snow removal and de-icing during episodes of heavy snowfall this winter. The Department of Public Service administers a variety of municipal services within the City of Columbus necessary for public health and safety, including snow removal and de-icing during inclement weather. With more than 90,000 lane miles of roadways to service each winter, the Department of Public Service seeks the assistance of other jurisdictions and independent contractors to supplement City crews on local roadways. This year, the Department of Public Service posted one solicitation seeking local companies to assist in snow and ice removal operations on an on-call basis. City Wide Facility Solutions (Columbus) responded offering to support those operations by providing up to two (2) trucks and staff capable of plowing or de-icing during heavy snowfall. This legislation seeks to authorize the execution of a service contract between the Department of Public Service and Duncan Sales, Inc. dba City Wide Facility Solutions (Columbus) and the expenditure of up to $85,000.00 to support the same. \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Duncan Sales, Inc. is CC-047290, which expires November 15, 2025. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $85,000.00 is available within the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund to support the proposed expenditure. \n4.  REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF FORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS\nThe Department of Public Service posted one solicitation, RFQ027294, seeking information from prospective independent contractors with the availability and capacity to assist the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management in snow removal and de-icing efforts during episodes of heavy snowfall. However, respondents, including City Wide Facility Solutions (Columbus), were not required to submit a formal proposal or bid with the questionnaire they were asked to complete. For this reason, a request for waiver of the formal competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 is requested to enable the Department of Public Service to contract with Duncan Sales, Inc. dba City Wide Facility Solutions (Columbus), thereby quickly securing the needed vehicles and operators before winter commences.  \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure the Department of Public Service has the assistance it needs to make City roadways passable and safe in a timely and efficient manner in the aftermath of major snow events. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into contract with Duncan Sales, Inc. dba City Wide Facility Solutions (Columbus) for the provision of snow removal and de-icing services this winter; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $85,000.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund for that purpose; and to declare an emergency.
