    "title": "To amend various sections of Chapter 1105 of the Columbus City Codes, to enact new water rates for the year beginning January 1, 2025; to expand eligibility for low income and eligible senior customer discount programs; and to repeal the existing sections being amended.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an increase in water rates effective January 1, 2025 for the Division of Water and amends Chapter 1105 of the Columbus City Codes, 1959.\n \nRequested adjustments in rates result in a typical inside city residential water rate increase of 7%.  When a sewer increase of 6% and a 1% increase in stormwater rates are considered, the overall impact on a typical residential customer's bill in the City of Columbus is 6.06% and for a typical outside city residential customer, the overall bill impact is 6.49%. Low Income Discount participant's overall bill impact is 6.0%. Outside city customers are not charged stormwater fees. Considering the 2025 rates increases for water, sewer, and storm combined -- based on an average residential customer with water use of 17 ccf's per quarter, City of Columbus residents are estimated to see their total bill increase $13.67 per quarter, or $54.67 per year. City of Columbus residents with a household of four or more with water use of 30 ccf's per quarter are estimated to see their total bill increase $21.41 per quarter, or $85.65 per year. \n \nThe Sewer and Water Advisory Board (SWAB) met on October 9, 2024, and after reviewing the Department of Public Utilities' projected expenditures for Fiscal Year 2025, recommends to City Council a 7% increase in water rates. \n \nThe proposed rate configuration for 2025 recognizes that water and sewer charges disproportionately affect lower income groups. The Department of Public Utilities will continue the Low Income Discount Programs that discounts participant's water commodity portion of their quarterly bill. The Board recommends an increase to the percentage of the discount from 20% to 25% and an increase in the qualifying federal poverty limit from 150% to 200%. The Department of Public Utilities will also continue the Eligible Senior Customer Discount that waives the monthly water service charges. The Board recommends an increase in the qualifying federal poverty limit from 150% to 200% for this program as well.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: These rate increases will generate approximately $14 million in additional revenue in Fiscal Year 2025. Combined with rate increases for Sewer and Stormwater, the overall impact to a City of Columbus' residents bill will be between 6.06% and 6.18%, depending on usage. \n \nTitle\nTo amend various sections of Chapter 1105 of the Columbus City Codes, to enact new water rates for the year beginning January 1, 2025; to expand eligibility for low income and eligible senior customer discount programs; and to repeal the existing sections being amended.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to establish new water services rates, effective January 1, 2025, for water service provided by the City of Columbus in order to recover the cost of rendering said water services; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water requests that a 7% rate increase be applied to water rates for 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council recognizes that increased water rates disproportionately impact low income residents.  Low income residents already pay a higher percentage of their household income in utility bills, and this percentage would increase with higher rates; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council further recognizes that past rate increases in the City have demonstrated that increasing rates leads to increased delinquencies among the City's customers; delinquency rates are higher among low income residents.  It is well recognized that increased delinquencies are expensive for the City and its customers; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council finds that continuing the discount rate for low income users is appropriate to assist those least able to manage the impacts of increased sewer and water rates and recognizes that an increase from 20% to 25% will help reduce this financial impact to low income customers; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council finds that it is appropriate to expand the low income and eligible senior customer discount program from 150% of the poverty level to include customers that have a total income of less than 200% of the poverty level as published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Sewer and Water Advisory Board has adopted recommendations that are consistent with the rates established in this legislation; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council finds that the rates and the low income and eligible senior discounts established therein are equitable to all of the City's customers; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the existing Section 1105.01 of the Columbus City Codes shall be amended effective January 1, 2025 to read as follows:\n \n\"Available frontage\" shall mean the frontage for all parcels which abut on the water main.
