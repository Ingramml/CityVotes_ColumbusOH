    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into a contract with Genuine Parts Co/NAPA for one (1) set of four (4) mobile column lifts and a service card kit to update current lift’s software. These mobile column lifts will be utilized by the Department of Finance, Fleet Division for the continued mission of optimal upkeep for all vehicles across several departments in the City of Columbus Fleet.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management Fleet Management Division solicited competitive bids for mobile column lifts and a service card kit in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.

The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles.
