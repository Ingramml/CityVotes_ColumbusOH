    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT), to establish a purchase order with CDW Government LLC, utilizing the State Contract RSC024735, expiring on 2/27/2028, for the procurement of the Palo Alto licenses and professional services. \nThe City utilizes the Palo Alto Firewall as the core City firewall service which provides all inbound and outbound internet connections to the City.
