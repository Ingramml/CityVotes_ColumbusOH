    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce, a non-profit corporation, in an amount up to $188,814.00 for the purpose of assisting the Department of Development to administer the Accelerate Columbus program. \n  \nThrough Accelerate Columbus, the City seeks to nurture a pipeline of entrepreneurs and small businesses that reflects the talent and diversity of Columbus. The ultimate objective of Accelerate Columbus is to provide structured, qualitatively, and quantitatively measurable programs for Columbus entrepreneurs and small businesses that strengthen the City’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In alignment with the Columbus Small Business Agenda, Accelerate Columbus seeks to further assist businesses in low- to moderate-income areas as well as minority and women-owned businesses.\n \nIn 2019, the City of Columbus launched the Accelerate Columbus program as part of a branded set of small business training, technical assistance, mentoring, and advisement programs targeting aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners. Initially offered as a pilot program, the purpose of the program was to provide structured, as well as on-demand training, one-on-one advisement, and technical assistance to both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs and small businesses by meeting gaps identified in the City’s Small Business Ecosystem Assessment and resulting Columbus Small Business Agenda.  \nThe Department of Development advertised a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA)/Request for Proposal (RFP) from July 1, 2024, through July 25, 2024, on the City’s Vendor Services and Bonfire websites.  The City received sixteen (16) proposals.  Proposals were evaluated and scored in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  The Director of Development desires to enter into a service contract with 10 of the 16 offerors. Of these 10, four are non-profit agencies and six are for-profit companies.  All contractors shall provide different small business training and technical assistance programs under Accelerate Columbus, which is needed for the program's success and cannot be covered by current City employees.  Additional legislation concerning the other nine organizations will be submitted concurrently with this piece of legislation.   \n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delay in administering the Accelerate Columbus 2025 program service.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $188,814.00 will be available in the 2024 Economic Development Division’s General Fund budget, contingent upon the passage Ordinance 2998-2024 for the third quarter financial review transfer.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s contract compliance 006012 expires 5/23/2026.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce in an amount up to $188,814.00 for the purpose of assisting the Department of Development to administer the Accelerate Columbus program; to authorize the expenditure of $188,814.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
