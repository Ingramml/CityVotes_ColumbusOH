    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to modify the not-for-profit service contract entered into with the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County for the purpose of extending the contract end date to December 31, 2025.\n \nColumbus City Council, per Ordinance Number 0595-2023, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County (AHT) in an amount up to $2,500,000.00 to provide funding to support emerging developers by way of loans to cohort participants that meet the underwriting requirements.  The loans are forgivable loans to developers as long as the project meets the affordability requirements. The contract, under purchase order #PO407615, started on September 27, 2023 and ends on December 31, 2024.  This modification is needed to extend the contract end date to December 31, 2025 to allow for additional minority participation in the 6 month training program.  \n \nThe unforeseen circumstances surrounding this modification related to the time needed for the minority developers to complete the program within the required time frame, thus, the lack of projects being created. Therefore, this modification will allow more time for the participants to meet the underwriting requirements.  \n \nThe program called, the Emerging Developers Accelerator Program (EDAP), is AHT’s minority developer cultivation and training program.  The goal of the EDAP is to increase the number of affordable housing units by engaging more women and people of color who are largely underrepresented as developers.  The program will reduce socioeconomic inequities by increasing the financial capacity of emerging developers to bring on more affordable housing units.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is needed to extend the term of the contract to ensure that it does not lapse before the program is completed and to prevent a disruption in services for women and minority developers during the seasons which are most advantageous to the specifications of said program.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation does not have a fiscal impact.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 005862 and contract compliance expires on 10/30/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify the not- for- profit service contract with the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County (AHT) for the purpose of extending the contract end date to December 31, 2025; and to declare an emergency. (0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS Columbus City Council, per Ordinance Number 0595-2023, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County (AHT) in an amount up to $2,500,000.00 to provide funding to support emerging developers; and \n \nWHEREAS, the contract started on September 27, 2023 and ends on December 31, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, amendment modification is needed to extend the contract end date to December 31, 2025 to allow additional minority participation in the 6 month training program; and   \n  \nWHEREAS, the Emerging Developers Accelerator Program (EDAP), is AHT’s minority developer cultivation and training program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the goal of the EDAP is to increase the number of affordable housing units by engaging more women and people of color who are largely underrepresented as developers thereby, reducing socioeconomic inequities by increasing the financial capacity of emerging developers to bring on more affordable housing units; and\n \n \nWHEREAS,  an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the not-for-profit service contract with the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County to extend the contract end date of December 31, 2025 for the purpose of allowing additional minority participation in the 6 month Emerging Developers Accelerator Program (EDAP) and to ensure that the existing contract does not lapse, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; and NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify the contract (PO407615) with the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County by extending the contract end date to December 31, 2025 for the purpose of allowing additional minority participation in the 6 months Emerging Developers Accelerator Program (EDAP).\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
