    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Not-for-Profit Service Contract with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) in an amount up to $18,090.00 from the 2024 General Fund.  Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting September 1, 2023.\n \nOrdinance 2616-2023 authorized the City to partner with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation on a project to create a series of new sidewalk art installations in the Scioto Peninsula.  CDDC contracted with Designing Local to conduct a call for artists and manage the selection process. Development officials were involved in the review and selection of the artist, but after reviewing the timing for installation, it was learned the area originally identified for the project would be under construction for the next several years, making the addition of sculptures to the sidewalks, no longer feasible for the current timeframe. In an effort to keep the project moving forward Recreation and Parks was contacted about an alternate location in nearby Dorrian Green Park, but a viable solution could not be reached. Ultimately, the timing and location challenges led to pause the project at that time and the funding allocation was canceled. \n \nThe detail of expenses paid out by CDDC to date for this project include project management costs for the call for artists and selection process, as well as $1,000.00 stipends for concept development for each of the 6 finalists, for a total of $6,000.00 in stipends.  The 1099 documents for each of the finalists will be handled directly with each vendor by Designing Local LTD.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide up to $18,090.00 for costs already incurred to manage the selection process.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this agreement is included in the Department of Development’s 2024\nGeneral Fund Budget, but will require a transfer of $18,090.00 between object classes.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Columbus Downtown Development Corporation’s vendor number is 010217 and expires 7/8/2026.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Not-for-Profit Service Contract with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) in an amount up to $18,090.00; to authorize a transfer within and the expenditure of $18,090.00 from the General Fund; to authorize expenses incurred prior to the Purchase Order in an amount up to $18,090.00; to authorize expenditures for stipends for concept development for 6 finalists; and to declare an emergency. ($18,090.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2616-2023 established that the city will be partnering with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation on a project to create a series of new sidewalk art installations in the Scioto Peninsula; and\n \nWHEREAS, Department of Development officials were involved in the review and selection of the artist, but when they began to look at timing for installation, it was learned the area originally identified for the project would be under construction for the next several years, making the addition of sculpture to the sidewalks no longer feasible for the current timeframe; and \n \nWHEREAS, the timing and location challenges led to a decision to pause the project at that time, and the funding allocation was canceled; and\n \nWHEREAS, to authorize the transfer and expenditure in an amount up to $18,090.00 for expenses paid out by CDDC to date for this project include project management costs for the call for artists and selection process, as well as stipends for concept development for 6 finalists; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to provide up to $18,090.00 for costs already incurred to manage the selection process, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That this contract is awarded in accordance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code related to Not-for-Profit Service Contract.\n \nSECTION 5. That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements or agreement modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
