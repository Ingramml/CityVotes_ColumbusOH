    "description": "AExplanation\n \nBackground: The City, Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (dba Downtown Columbus, Inc.), an Ohio not-for-profit corporation, and Scioto Peninsula Holdings Ltd. (“SPH”), an Ohio limited liability company, entered into that certain Economic Development Agreement dated as of February 7, 2017 authorized by Ordinance No. 3121-2016. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 0193-2017, the City of Columbus has leased to SPH, a subsidiary of Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, the real property which has the general boundaries of West Broad Street to the north, Belle Street to the east, West Town Street to the south, and the Norfolk Southern right of way west of Starling Street to the west (the “Peninsula”) for a term of 99 years, renewable forever. As contemplated by the lease, the City has previously conveyed four lots on the Peninsula to SPH to facilitate the first phase of the Peninsula development resulting in construction of approximately 231,000 square feet of office space, 330 apartment units, and 193 hotel rooms. \n \nThe 2022 Downtown Strategic Plan, adopted by Resolution No. 0164X-2022, recommends: creating a 15-minute downtown where people do not need a car to accomplish the basic needs of living (grocery, pharmacy, daycare, shopping, etc.); identifying focus areas for growing urban districts to concentrate public and private investment for short, intermediate, and long-term success; and requiring and approving high density urban residential development downtown to grow the population. The next phase of Peninsula development is proposed to include approximately 385 residential units, a 35,000 square foot grocery store, and 450 stall parking public garage (collectively, “Phase II”). The parties desire to enter into a memorandum of understanding (the “Phase II MOU”) outlining the parties’ respective commitments for Phase II to implement the 2022 Downtown Strategic Plan. As contemplated by the lease between the City and SPH, whereby DCI and SPH proposes to acquire the City’s fee simple title to two additional Peninsula lots, identified as Lots 1 and 3 of the Scioto Peninsula Subdivision, more fully described in the attached Exhibit A to this Ordinance, (collectively, the “Property”). In order to attract an operator for the new Phase II grocery store in a high-density development, the Phase II MOU also proposes the City requesting up to nineteen million dollars in future capital improvement budgets, subject to City Council consideration and approval of future legislation, to finance the design and construction of the Phase II public garage, which will be owned by DCI and SPH. \n \nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development and the Director of Finance and Management to enter into the Phase II MOU. It also authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to execute quit claim deeds to SPH conveying title to the Property; to execute joinders and consents to utility, encroachment, maintenance, and temporary construction easements necessary for the redevelopment; and to execute other pertinent documents.  It is in the City's best interest that this Ordinance will waive the requirements of approval from the Land Review Commission and Chapter 329 of City Code relating to the sale of city-owned real property so that the property can be transferred as quickly as possible to allow Phase II to proceed.\n \nFiscal Impact:  No funding is required for this legislation. The Department of Development will request sixteen million dollars in the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget, and thereafter may request up to three million dollars more in future Capital Improvement Budgets.\n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development and the Department of Finance and Management, in that it is necessary to immediately execute the Phase II MOU and convey the Property because, without such prompt execution and conveyance, DCI and SPH cannot authorize its contractor to commence construction by their agreed upon timeframe and any such delays risk increasing both the public and private costs of the Phase II project. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development and the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute a memorandum of understanding with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation doing business as Downtown Columbus, Inc. and Scioto Peninsula Holdings, Ltd. to memorialize the parties’ understandings as to the second phase of the development project on the Scioto Peninsula; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management and/or Director of Public Service if involving the right-if-way to execute quit claim deeds generally providing for the transfer of all of the City’s fee simple interest in Lots 1 and 3 of the Scioto Peninsula Subdivision to Columbus Downtown Development Corporation and Scioto Peninsula Holdings, Ltd., reserving necessary easements for utilities, signs, or other improvements and subject to other restrictions of record, to Columbus Downtown Development Corporation and Scioto Peninsula Holdings, Ltd.; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into and execute other documents pertinent to such transaction, to the extent applicable, such as releasing said transferred property from a prior lease agreement; to waive the requirements of the Land Review Commission and Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes relating to the sale of city-owned real property; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City, Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (dba Downtown Columbus, Inc.), an Ohio not-for-profit corporation, and Scioto Peninsula Holdings Ltd.
