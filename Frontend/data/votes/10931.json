    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  By Ordinance Nos. 2446-2003, 0451-2004, and 1007-2004, City Council, as the “organizational board of commissioners,” determined a petition for a new community authority filed with the Clerk of City Council by Downtown Columbus, Inc., formerly Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, (the “Developer”) was sufficient and established the RiverSouth Authority (the “Authority”) pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 349 to support the redevelopment of several square blocks in downtown Columbus generally bounded by Town Street and State Street on the north, High Street and Wall Street on the east, Rich Street and Cherry Street on the south, and Front Street and Ludlow Street on the west (the “District”). In partnership with the City to implement the 2022 Downtown Columbus Strategic Plan adopted by City Council pursuant to Resolution No. 0164X-2022, the Developer is currently planning new financing, land acquisition, land development, and community facilities in downtown Columbus. By Resolution Nos. 0018X-2023, 0034X-2023, and 0046X-2023, the District was expanded by a first amendment to petition to include three additional non-adjacent properties located near the following intersections: Long Street and Wall Street, Gay Street and Front Street, and Walnut Street and Washington Avenue.  \n \nThe Developer now seeks to again add to the District certain additional properties it owns or controls. On or about October 23, 2024, the Developer submitted to the Clerk of City Council a second amendment to petition (the “Second Amendment”) to add the Developer’s additional properties to the District. By Resolution 0289X-2024, City Council determined the sufficiency of the Second Amendment, and fixed the time and place for a public hearing on the Second Amendment, which was held November 22, 2024. This Resolution expresses City Council’s authorization that the Second Amendment for another expansion of the District is approved and will be conducive to the public health, safety, convenience, and welfare, and is intended to result in the development of a new community. This Resolution also declares that the second expansion of the District will be consistent with the development of the new community, will not jeopardize the plan of the new community, is intended to result in the development of the new community, and defines the boundary of the new community district.\n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development because the Authority needs the properties described in the Second Amendment to be immediately added to the District in order to allow the Authority by law to use its financing to acquire one or more of those properties in the expanded area of the District prior to the closing deadline before the end of the year set by the seller, which such acquisition is immediately necessary to the Department of Development implementing the 2022 Downtown Columbus Strategic Plan. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo approve the Second Amendment to Petition for Organization of a New Community Authority for expansion of the new community district of the RiverSouth Authority; to authorize the expansion of the new community district of the RiverSouth Authority and define the boundary of the expanded new community district to include certain additional property owned or controlled by Downtown Columbus, Inc., formerly Columbus Downtown Development Corporation; to certify compliance of the requirements of the public hearing on the second expansion area; and to declare an emergency.
