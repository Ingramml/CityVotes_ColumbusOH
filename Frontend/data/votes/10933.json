    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Department of Public Service is seeking Council approval to pursue a technical assistance grant from City Thread.  The Department of Public Service intends to apply for the Accelerated Mobility Playbook (AMP) Technical Assistant Grant Program to accelerate the implementation of a mobility network.\n \nCity Thread is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to accelerate projects that help people move safely, efficiently, and equitably throughout their communities.  They are currently accepting applications through November 20, 2024.  The AMP Technical Assistance Grant Program is intended to help U.S. cities accelerate the implementation of a mobility network.  Deliverables and opportunities from the program include a site visit to understand a city’s processes, relationships, opportunities for change, and more; an assessment of a city’s project-delivery process, commitments from community leaders, and community and philanthropic support; a strategic roadmap to improve mobility network implementation, build lasting partnerships, and amplify existing public support; and an in-person gathering with other grantees to meet and engage with peers from other cities.  The program requires a $15,000 local match.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application. The Department of Public Service (DPS) is looking to build upon the momentum from its Bike Plus planning efforts.  An AMP technical assistance grant will help DPS engage with community organizations who don’t currently touch mobility with their missions, but are impacted by the advancement of Columbus’ micro mobility network.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally apply for the technical assistance grant from City Thread and, if awarded, to accept the award on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to execute those documents necessary to accept the grant, to administer the grant funds, and to refund any unused funds to City Thread after the grant period ends if final accounting determines a refund is owed.  Separate legislation will be submitted to Council to expend awarded grant funds. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time. Approval of this legislation will allow the Department of Public Service to apply for a technical assistance grant award from City Thread. If the grant is awarded and accepted, a $15,000.00 local match would be required.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to apply for the Accelerated Mobility Playbook Technical Assistant Grant through City Thread and accept the award when announcements are made in December.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for the Accelerated Mobility Playbook Technical Assistant Grant through City Thread to supplement the Bike Plus planning efforts; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with City Thread and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant; to authorize the expenditure of local match funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Thread, a national nonprofit organization, has announced a grant opportunity for its Accelerated Mobility Playbook (AMP) Technical Assistance Grant Program, which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and \n \nWHEREAS, City Thread is accepting applications for the AMP Technical Assistance Grant Program through November 20, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service (DPS) is looking to build upon the momentum from its Bike Plus planning efforts, and engage with community organizations who don’t currently touch mobility with their missions, but are impacted by the advancement of Columbus’ micro mobility network; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to prepare and submit the aforesaid grant application prior to the end of the application period, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to apply for a technical assistance grant from City Thread, to accept said grant if awarded, to execute any documents necessary to effectuate said application, acceptance and agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
