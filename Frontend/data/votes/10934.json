    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the existing Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC (“Lyft”) to support the continued operation of CoGo Bike Share.\n \nThe City of Columbus has provided financial support to CoGo Bike Share since its inception.\n \nOrdinance 2241-2012 authorized the execution of the City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement, between the Department of Recreation and Parks and Alta Bicycle Share, Inc., to facilitate the development, installation, operation, and management of a public bike share system, which launched on July 30, 2013, with 30 stations and 300 bikes. Since that time, CoGo Bike Share has grown to 91 docking stations and 550 bikes, including 300 classic bikes and 250 e-bikes, throughout the City, offering a low-cost option for alternative transit and personal recreation resulting in more than 65,000 rides in 2023.\n \nOrdinance 1572-2019 authorized the execution of the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Recreation and Parks and Motivate International, formerly known as Alta Bicycle Share, Inc., to facilitate the continued operation of the CoGo Bike Share through July 1, 2024.\n \nOrdinance 2311-2021 authorized the execution of the First Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Recreation and Parks and Lyft, which acquired Motivate International, Inc.\n \nOrdinance 0950-2023 authorized the execution of the Second Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Public Service, which assumed responsibility for supporting CoGo Bike Share from the Department of Recreation and Parks pursuant to that legislation, and Lyft. \n \nOrdinance 2048-2023 authorized the execution of the Third Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Public Service and Lyft to provide financial support to CoGo Bike Share through the end of 2023.\n \nOrdinance 0201-2024 authorized the Fourth Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Public Service and Lyft to provide financial support to CoGo Bike Share through the first half of 2024.\n \nOrdinance 1696-2024 authorized the Fifth Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Public Service and Lyft to provide financial support to CoGo Bike Share through the end of 2024. \n \nThe Department of Public Service, together with representatives for the cities of Dublin and Upper Arlington and Ohio State University, recently concluded a competitive procurement process resulting in a contract award to VeoRide, Inc. to oversee an expanded shared micromobility system. The ensuing transition will take several months, and in the interim, it is necessary to allow Lyft to continue to operate and manage CoGo Bike Share through at least the first quarter of 2025 so as not to completely disrupt those operations during that period.\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to extend the current contract for the ongoing operation of that program through March 31, 2025, during which time the Department of Public Service intends to onboard a new service provider to oversee an expanded shared micromobility system, and to modify the terms of the agreement as it pertains to the disposition of CoGo assets. This ordinance is being submitted in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications.\n \nThe Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement, dated July 1, 2019, states that upon expiration or termination of the Program Agreement, Contractor may at its option, and upon agreement from the City, purchase any or all of the Capital Equipment from the City at the depreciated value of such Capital Equipment.  This legislation authorizes the Department of Public Service to modify and clarify, if applicable, those terms.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:                                          \nNo additional funding is needed at this time.\n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThe Department of Public Service expected to have to modify the existing Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement with Lyft periodically after assuming responsibility for supporting CoGo Bike Share. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe Department of Public Service, together with representatives for the cities of Dublin and Upper Arlington and Ohio State University, recently concluded a competitive procurement process resulting in a contract award to VeoRide, Inc. to oversee an expanded shared micromobility system. The ensuing transition will take several months, and in the interim, it is necessary to allow Lyft to continue to operate and manage CoGo Bike Share through at least the first quarter of 2025 so as not to completely disrupt those operations during that period. \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nNo additional funding is needed at this time.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC is CC040364, which expires December 19, 2025. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact associated with this ordinance.    \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite contract modification before December 31, 2024, when the current contract term is set to expire, so as to prevent an interruption in services.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify an existing service contract with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC to facilitate the continued operation of the CoGo Bike Share program through March 31, 2025; to waive Columbus City Code pertaining to the sale of City-owned personal property; and to declare an emergency.
