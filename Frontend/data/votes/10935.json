    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into a reimbursement agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, with the Indiana & Ohio Railway Company (“IORY”), a subsidiary of Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., and to encumber and expend funds to compensate IORY for services rendered during the engineering phase of the UIRF - Eakin Road SUP project. \nThe aforementioned effort will culminate in the installation of a shared use path along the north side of Eakin Road from South Wayne Avenue to Whitethorne Avenue and along the south side of Eakin Road from Whitethorne Avenue to Harrisburg Pike (US 62). The project crosses the bridge over Early Run, which will require modification to accommodate a 10’ shared use path.  \nThat scope of work dictates that IORY, which operates within the project limits, review and approve engineering plans, design plans, construction specifications, and drawings, and other documents and to perform other services necessary to the successful completion of the project in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors. To that end, this legislation seeks to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with IORY, which presently is owned and operated by Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., and to compensate IORY for said services.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $32,298.00 is available for this project in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within the Department of Public Service. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of cash is necessary to provide sufficient cash and budget authority for the requisite expenditure. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite agreement before year-end so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion and acceptance of design plans.  \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into agreements with Indiana & Ohio Railway Company, a subsidiary of Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., relative to the UIRF - Eakin Road SUP project; to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $32,298.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($32,298.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is administering the UIRF - Eakin Road SUP project, which will culminate in the installation of a shared use path along the north side of Eakin Road from South Wayne Avenue to Whitethorne Avenue and along the south side of Eakin Road from Whitethorne Avenue to Harrisburg Pike (US 62); and \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned effort requires cooperation from the Indiana & Ohio Railway Company (“IORY”), which operates within the project limits; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Department of Public Service to engage IORY to review and approve engineering and design plans, construction specifications and drawings, and other documents and to perform other services necessary to the successful completion of the project in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors; and \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the execution of a reimbursement agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary,  between the Department and IORY, a subsidiary of Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., and the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $32,298.00, relative to the UIRF - Eakin Road SUP project; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned project expenditure; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a transfer of cash within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the purposes of providing sufficient cash for the aforementioned project expenditure; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to execute the requisite agreement before year-end so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion and acceptance of design plans, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
