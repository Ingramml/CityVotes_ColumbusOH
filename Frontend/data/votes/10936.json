    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) has issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for approximately $800 million in discretionary grant funding through the Low Carbon Transportation Materials (LCTM) Program.  This is a new program.  The NOFO was released on August 27, 2024 and will remain open through November 25, 2024.\n \nThe LCTM program provides funding for the use of construction materials that have substantially lower levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The program will distribute grants with the goals to increase the use of lower carbon materials and products that are used in projects funded under Title 23 of the United States Code, facilitate the use of low carbon transportation materials while ensuring appropriateness for use in projects eligible under Title 23, promote technology transfer and enhance workforce development to increase the adoption of environmental quantification techniques used in decision making by transportation agencies, and encourage eligible recipients to begin LCTM activities and build successful low carbon transportation material identification frameworks.  Activities anticipated to be funded under this program are identification frameworks for eligible materials, work needed to determine their appropriateness for use on eligible projects, and the use of low carbon transportation materials on eligible construction projects.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit a LCTM program application.  A successful application would ensure the Public Service Department had the equipment, skills, and processes necessary to begin incorporating LCTM into its construction program.  The Department estimates the total project cost will be at least $3 million, and it intends to request up to 100% of the future eligible project costs in LCTM funding from USDOT.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally apply for a LCTM program grant.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USDOT or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nLCTM grants may be used for up to one-hundred percent (100%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with an application prior to the application period’s end.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a Low-Carbon Transportation Materials Program Grant from the United States Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Transportation and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced a funding opportunity for the Low Carbon Transportation Materials (LCTM) Program, which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDOT is accepting applications for the current funding round through November 25, 2024; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City intends to submit a grant application for acquiring the equipment, skills, and processes necessary to begin incorporating LCTM into its construction program; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to prepare and submit the aforesaid grant application prior to the end of the application period, for the public health, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from USDOT’s LCTM program to improve its construction program; to accept said grants, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 3.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
