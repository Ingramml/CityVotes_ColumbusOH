    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to modify and extend an existing contract with MKSK through December 31, 2024; and to declare an emergency. (0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: \nOrdinance No. 1712-2023 authorized the expenditure of up to $849,600 from the Department of Neighborhoods General Fund - Fund 1000 to engage the Eastland community, City Departments, and other community partners to develop a comprehensive community plan for the Eastland area.\nThis ordinance is needed to modify PO396050 by extending the contract with MKSK through December 31, 2024. This will extend Phase 4 of the project and culminate in a finalized comprehensive Eastland Community Plan developed through a collaborative, community-driven process. The current contract period is August 1, 2023 to December 1, 2024 (Ordinance 2540-2023). No additional funding is required to modify and extend this contract. \nThe Department of Neighborhoods, solicited Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the community planning services contract. The project was formally advertised on Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from March 3, 2023 to April 13, 2023. The proposed project period in the RFP was 12-18 months from contract date. This extension is within the proposed project period outlined in the RFP (16 months, 30 days). Additional time needed to complete the comprehensive community plan could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.\nMKSK won the initial RFP and have been actively working with city departments and the Eastland community on community planning services that are not complete. It’s in the best interest of the Department to continue working with the selected vendor.\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is required to modify and extend this contract. The existing scope of services outlined in the contract will remain unchanged.\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow timely execution of this contract modification, to prevent a lapse in the current contract and avoid delays in the completion of the community plan. The current contract ends December 1, 2024\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to modify and extend an existing contract with MKSK through December 31, 2024; and to declare an emergency. (0.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify contract PO396050 with MKSK and extend through December 31, 2024 in order to complete the comprehensive Eastland Community Plan; and\nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1712-2023 authorized the Director of Neighborhoods to enter into a professional services contract with MKSK for community planning services; and\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2540-2023 authorized the current contract end date of December 1, 2024; and\nWHEREAS, additional funding is not required to modify and extend this contract; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Neighborhoods in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Neighborhoods to modify a service contract with MKSK in order to allow timely execution of this contract modification, to prevent a lapse in the current contract and avoid delays in the completion of the community plan, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
