    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Aspyr in support of its income support workforce development program in the amount of up to $434,720.00.\n \nIncome support program offers a temporary income replacement for underemployed individuals to participate in mid-term (10-20 week) training opportunities. In many cases, participants are able to use this support as income replacement, stepping away from their current jobs to focus on training for a higher-paying career path with additional opportunities. These opportunities led to higher earning potential and career advancement pathways for all participants.\n \nThis is the third year of funding support for the income support program. Ordinance 0832-2022 authorized $200,000.00 and was approved by City Council on April 4, 2022. Ordinance 0635-2023 authorized $400,000.00 and was approved by City Council on February 27, 2023. Funds are remaining from both of these grant agreements due to challenges that slowed program implementation. The grant agreements associated with both of these ordinances have now expired and cannot be extended. Additionally, both of these grant agreements were with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio, which has since formally changed its name to Aspyr.\n \nAs a result of these changes and challenges, this ordinance authorizes a new grant agreement with Aspyr. This grant agreement will extend from January 1, 2023 to allow for support to be provided, as intended, during the continuation of the program in 2023 and 2024. Because the program is ongoing and funds are remaining, the grant agreement shall extend to December 31, 2025. This grant agreement therefore supports both reimbursement for grant expenses in 2023 and in 2024, as well as the continuation of programming in 2025. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available for this ordinance in the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Aspyr in support of their income support program; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund. ($434,720.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Aspyr is a local not-for-profit organization that leads the development and implementation of highly innovative and measurably effective workforce strategies and programs that build prosperity for all; and\n \nWHEREAS, Aspyr operates an income support program that provides financial support to participants in select workforce development training programs; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to support pathways to prosperity for all Columbus residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a grant agreement between the City Clerk and Aspyr in support of their income support workforce development program; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Aspyr, in an amount of up to $434,720.00, for a term of January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025, in support of their income support workforce development program, and to authorize expenditures incurred prior to the date of the purchase order.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $434,720.00 in the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.

That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
