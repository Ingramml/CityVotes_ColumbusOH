    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Subaward Not-for Profit Service Contract with Faith Mission, Inc. to provide community services related to the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) program from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 in an amount of up to $775,500.00 utilizing the 2023 and 2024 HOPWA entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and to declare an emergency.  \n \nHistorically the HOPWA grant has been managed and administrated by Columbus Public Health (CPH).  Starting with the 2022 grant year funds, the HOPWA grant is being managed and administered by the Department of Development (DOD), Division of Housing.  \n \nThe HOPWA program provides for the implementation of long-term comprehensive strategies for meeting the housing needs of low-income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families.  Eligible services/activities include providing housing information services; resource identification; acquisition, rehabilitation, conversion, lease, and repair of facilities to provide housing and services; new construction of housing units; project or tenant based rental assistance; short term rent, mortgage, and utility payments; supportive services; technical assistance and administrative support.  \n \nFaith Mission, Inc. will provide housing assistance and services to low-income individuals and/or households living with HIV/AIDS. We are funding this program to help ensure that PLWHA (Persons Living with HIV/AIDS) have stable, safe, decent, affordable, and sanitary housing. As housing is also a social determinant of health, funding this program can help support physical, mental, and behavioral health for PLWHA and help the EHE (Ending HIV Epidemic) Initiative. Funding will be used for long term and short-term rental assistance, short term mortgage and utility assistance, non-housing supportive services, and administration of the program. This program is an existing program entering into its 3rd full year with the Department of Development.\n \nThis legislation represents a part of the 2023 and 2024 Action Plans per Ordinance numbers 3353-2022 and 2993-2023.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is needed to assure funding is in place at the start of the year to support those persons living with HIV/AIDS.  \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 011758 and the expiration date is 04/20/2025.\n \nFiscal Impact: $775,500.00 is available within the 2023 and 2024 HOPWA Grants (G442203 and G442303). Funding is contingent upon passage of 2949-2024.\n \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Subaward Not-for Profit Service Contract with Faith Mission, Inc. from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025 in an amount of up to $775,500.00; to authorize the appropriation of $500.00 and the expenditure of $775,500.00 of funds utilizing the 2023 and 2024 Housing Opportunities for People with Aids (HOPWA) entitlement grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and declare an emergency.
