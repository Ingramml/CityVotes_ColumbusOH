    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a service contract with Revere Roofing Company, Inc. for the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program, in an amount up to $150,000.00; requests that Columbus City Council waive the provisions of Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14 and 329.09 for the Roof Replacement Program; and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements, including modifications if necessary, with homeowner participants in the Roof Replacement Program if the total grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, all without having to return to City Council for each project under the Roof Replacement Program.\n \nThe department advertised RFQ028880 on Vendor Services and Bonfire seeking contractors to provide roof replacement services for the Roof Replacement Program.  The effort was advertised from October 4, 2024, to October 25, 2024. The department notified 158 registered vendors and three (3) bids were received. \n \nThe Director of the Department of Development requests to enter into contract with the three lowest, responsive, responsible, and best bidders as multiple contractors are needed for this program. Each contract will be under a separate ordinance.\n \n\n\n\nOfferor\n\nMWBE Status\n\nEvaluation\n\nSubcontractor\n\n\n\n Revere Roofing Company, Inc.\n\nnot registered\n\ncontract\n\nyes\n\n\n\nMann Roofing Construction, LLC \n\nMBE\n\ncontract\n\nno\n\n\n\n Freedom Roofing Windows and Siding LLC \n\nnot registered\n\ncontract\n\nno\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Roof Replacement Program is a home repair program operated by the Division of Housing. The program was established to assist low and moderate-income homeowners with replacement of roof and roof elements that constitute a critical condition, and when such condition is not corrected, could cause the homeowner to vacate their home.\n \nThe Roof Replacement Program requires two different types of agreements:  a grant agreement with the participant homeowner and a contract with the contractor.  Once a participant is approved for the program, the Director enters into a grant agreement with the participant that outlines the scope of work to be performed and the value of the grant (the cost of work to be performed by the contractor).  While the cost of work includes a contingency, there are occasionally unforeseen circumstances that may increase the cost.  If this were to occur, a grant agreement modification would be required to increase the value of the grant.  The waiver of Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14 (requiring City Council approval for a grant agreement over $5,000) and 329.09 (requiring City Council approval for contract [grant] modification) for each project will allow the work to be done in a timely and efficient manner.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue correct roof conditions that may cause homeowners to vacate their property.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $150,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund, (Fund 7779). An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation within the fund is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project. The funding will be authorized for expenditure from Fund 7779.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 045478 and expires 5/23/2025.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a service contract with Revere Roofing Company, Inc. for the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program, in an amount up to $150,000.00, using Affordable Housing Taxable Bond funds; to waive the provisions of Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14 and 329.09 for the Roof Replacement Program; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements, including modifications if necessary, with homeowner participants in the Roof Replacement Program if the total grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, all without having to return to City Council for each project under the Roof Replacement Program; and to declare an emergency.
