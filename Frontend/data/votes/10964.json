    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Effectiff LLC for one additional year of translation services.  \n \nOriginal contract amount                     $    1,000.00                     PO437778\nModification No. 1 amount                     $           0.00                     \nTotal contract amount                                          $    1,000.00\n \nThe Division of Housing provides emergency repairs, critical home repairs, addressing lead paint hazards, healthy home repairs, and emergency relocation services for residents.  As a part of receiving this funding, there is an application process where the City requests proof of income and other documents provided by the applicant.  This service provides interpretation and translation services for persons with limited English proficiency who receive the Division of Housing’s services. \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ026205 on Vendor Services in November 2023 for these services.  Eight bids were received, and the Director of Department of Development entered into contract with the lowest bidder under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.18.  The original contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2024, with an option to renew for one (1) additional year, starting January 1, 2025.  However, because renewals must be authorized by ordinance by operation of Columbus City Code Section 329.09, legislation is required to authorize a contract modification to extend the contract. The remaining funds are being asked to be modified and carried forward through the requested modification date of December 31, 2025 per Columbus City Code Section 329.09.  \n \nThis legislation will extend the existing contract through December 31, 2025.\n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     No additional funds to be expended.\n2.                     The need for additional services was foreseen at the time the initial contract was awarded, but a legislative modification is required by operation of C.C. 329.09(b).\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to continue with the Effectiff LLC current contract as they are the administrator of translation services for the Division of Housing. \n4.                     No additional funds are required by this ordinance.\n \nEmergency action is requested to prevent a gap of providing translation services for persons with limited English proficiency who receives the Division of Housing’ services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No additional funding is necessary.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 041262 and expires 3/10/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with Effectiff LLC to extend the agreement for one additional year; and to declare an emergency.
