    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Office entered into a contract with Homeland Language Services LLC for interpreter and translation services on March 1, 2024, for up to $10,000.00. This legislation authorizes the City Attorney to modify (Modification No. 1) the current contract and increase it by $4,000.00, and to declare an emergency in order to ensure the City Attorney’s Office has continued interpreter and translation services.\n \nBACKGROUND: The Columbus City Attorney’s Office has a contract with Homeland Language Services LLC from March 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025 that requires a modification for additional funds in the amount of $4,000.00. The original contract was an estimate on an average annual usage. The need for these additional funds was not foreseeable at the time of the initial contract due to an unanticipated increase in demand for interpreter and translation services. Homeland Language Services LLC is currently providing satisfactory service under the existing contract. (Bid RFQ024288)\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The amount of the contract modification is $4,000.00, and the total amount of this contract, as modified, is $14,000.00. This contract modification will be funded by the General Fund.\n \nOriginal contract amount $10,000.00 (PO442562) \n(current balance of contract PO: $2,025.27)\nModification No. 1 amount $4,000.00 (This Ordinance)\nTotal contract amount $14,000.00\n \nCOMPANY: Homeland Language Services LLC, FID: 81-1888007, CC-044362, expires 11/26/20226\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify an existing contract with Homeland Language Services LLC; to authorize the expenditure of $4,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($4,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, on March 1, 2024, the City Attorney’s Office entered into a contract with Homeland Language Services LLC in an amount not to exceed $10,000.00 to provide interpreter and translation services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney has identified the need to modify an existing contract with Homeland Language Services LLC, for interpreter and translation services in an amount up to $4,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operations of the Columbus City Attorney’s Office to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and expend these funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, these services are essential to the City Attorney's Office for effective communication with City residents of limited English proficiency, particularly in cases involving domestic violence survivors, and the lack of such services would significantly hinder the City's ability to provide critical legal assistance and protection to vulnerable populations; \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Columbus City Attorney’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Attorney to modify the existing contract with Homeland Language Services LLC to ensure the continuation of vital interpreter and translation services; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Attorney be and is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with Homeland Language Services LLC, in the amount of $4,000.00, bringing the contract total to $14,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purposes stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $4,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), 24-2401 (City Attorney), in object class 03 (Purchased services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3. That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Codes Chapter 329 relating to contract modifications.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish such accounting codes as necessary, to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements, contracts, or modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure because insufficient funds remain under the current contract and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
