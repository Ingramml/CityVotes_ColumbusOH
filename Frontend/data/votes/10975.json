    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services agreement with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc. for the Franklinton Stormwater Improvements project, CIP #610910-100001, in an amount up to $900,921.03.\n \nThe Franklinton Area Stormwater System Improvements project was initiated to develop master planning and detailed design plans for constructing storm sewers and/or detention facilities to improve stormwater system capacity in the Franklinton Area.  The goal of this project is to mitigate street and structural flooding caused by insufficient capacity of the Renick Run storm sewer system, south of I-70 and north of Renick Run Pump Station. The project area is bounded on the north by I-670, south by Hart Rd, west by Wheatland Ave. and east by SR-315 and I-71 freeway.\nThe initial funding for this project prepared a detailed storm model of the West Franklinton neighborhood. Alternatives were proposed to resolve the flooding issues and, after extensive discussion with shareholders, a preferred alternative has been determined. This alternative has been approved by management and property acquisition has begun. \n \nThere a total of 3 phases of this project. Once all 3 phases are complete, the level of service of the storm sewer system in the West Franklinton neighborhood will handle rain events to avoid surcharges for:\n•  The 2 year design storm on local streets and,\n•  The 5 year design storm on arterial streets.\n \nThis phase, Phase 1, of the project, was to determine a solution to the flooding problem and design improvements to increase capacity downstream of West Franklinton.  The design improvements include a retention basin in McCoy Park and a large trunk sewer to the corner of Mound Street and Glenwood Avenue.  This contract modification will perform preliminary engineering and design to 30% completion.  An additional contract modification will be necessary to complete preliminary design.\n \nThe Community Planning Area for this project is 54 - Franklinton.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $900,921.03\n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                   $2,528,145.64 (ORD 1470-2019; PO185019)\nModification #1                                     $   900,921.03 (Current)\nModification #2                                     $2,500,000.00\nModification #3                                     $2,500,000.00\nModification #4                                     $1,000,000.00 \nTotal:                                                   $ 9,429,066.67\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded using the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding to complete design.  This is one of the planned design funding modifications.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe consultant prepared a scope and cost per task based upon current contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.  The cost was then negotiated by the City Project Manager. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will increase sewer system capacity for West Franklinton to handle:\n•  The 2 year event on local streets and,\n•  The 5 year rain event on arterial streets.\n \nWith additional capacity in the storm sewer system, maintenance, property damage, and travel will be improved in the study area.\n \n3.
