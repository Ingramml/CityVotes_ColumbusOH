    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) released a Notice of Funding Opportunity for approximately $58 million in discretionary grant funding for FY 2024 through its Solid Waste Infrastructure For Recycling (SWIFR) Grant Program for Political Subdivisions of States and Territories. The final NOFO was released on September 16, 2024 and remains open through December 20, 2024.\n \nThe SWIFR grant program funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is a historic investment in the health, equity, and resilience of American communities. The unprecedented funding provided by the BIL through the SWIFR grants will assist local waste management authorities by supporting improvements to local post-consumer materials management, including municipal recycling programs, and assisting local waste management authorities in making improvements to local waste management systems. The SWIFR grant program provides a critical opportunity to fund a range of high impact projects to increase recycling, reduce contamination, and promote a circular economy for sustainable materials management by making much-needed investments in solid waste management infrastructure. This RFA has the following goals: fund a range of projects that will help local governments and communities advance from “where they are” to significantly transform their post-consumer materials management infrastructure; fund projects that will result in a significant decrease in the generation of MSW and/or an increase in the diversion of MSW from landfills and incineration; and fund innovative solutions and programs that provide or increase access to prevention, reuse, mechanical recycling, anaerobic digestion, and composting. This program aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to disadvantaged communities.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application. The Department of Public Service is seeking funding to construct a permanent Waste and Reuse Convenience Center at the Alum Creek Drive Refuse Collection Station.  This new facility would include space for a Community Waste Diversion and Education Center.  The project also includes new water, sewer, and power connections that are necessary for the new facility.  The Department is requesting up to $5 million in SWIFR funding to support the construction.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a Solid Waste Infrastructure For Recycling grant, execute agreements with USEPA or others in connection with the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nSWIFR grants may be used for up to one-hundred percent (100%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with an application prior to the application period’s end, and prior to City Council’s upcoming break.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to apply for the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling Grant with the United States Environmental Protection Agency; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.

That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 3. That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.
