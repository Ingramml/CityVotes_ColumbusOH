    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - LinkUS - Northwest Corridor Phase 2 project.\n \nOrdinance 1451-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio for the Roadway - LinkUS - Northwest Corridor Phase 2 project.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $4,500,000.00 and is contingent upon the final execution of a contribution agreement modification between the City and Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA).  This ordinance is also contingent upon the receipt of a $2,250,000.00 contribution as required by the modified agreement with COTA.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $4,500,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $4,500,000.00.    (PO280444, Ord. 1451-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $4,500,000.00.    (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                         $9,000,000.00.    \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned contract modification.  The amount initially legislated for this project did not include the full amount that would be needed to fund this project through 30% design. There maybe future modifications if needed.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe full amount of the contract was not initially available, therefore it was planned that the contract would be modified as funds became available to complete the project to 30% design.  It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nTranSystems Corporation of Ohio and subconsultants provided a cost breakdown for each task included in the scope. After several negotiations, the final fee was determined to be in line with what is expected for the scope of work. Costs were also compared to other recent design project of similar scope and magnitude.  The cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against TranSystems Corporation of Ohio.\n \nAdditionally, Ordinance 1407-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to execute multiple contribution agreements to facilitate the completion of the Mobility Study - NW Corridor.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into an agreement modification with and to accept funds from COTA to advance the project; and  to, as necessary, authorize the acceptance of additional funding from COTA or the return of any unexpended design funding to the same after final accounting has been performed or the Department of Public Service certifies that any remaining funds are no longer needed for the project and can be refunded without the need for additional legislative action.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for TranSystems Corporation of Ohio is CC007988 and expires 7/8/2026.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis project is funded in part by a contribution in the amount of $2,250,000.00 from COTA pursuant to a Contribution Agreement Modification to be authorized as a part of this ordinance between the Department of Public Service and COTA.  Upon final execution of the agreement modification, the funds from COTA will be deposited in Fund 7766, the Streets and Highways Non-Bond Fund.  Public Service is requesting the executed modification between the parties be accepted by the Auditor’s Office and the Auditor’s Office allows Public Service to proceed with the legislation as if the funding has been received. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget to match cash is necessary to establish sufficient budget authority for the project which is contingent upon the receipt of a final executed grant agreement from COTA and receipt of their contribution in the amount of $2,250,000.00 to the design contract modification in Fund 7766, the Streets and Highways Non-Bond Fund. Funds will need to be appropriated.  \n \nThe remaining balance in the amount of $2,250,000.00 is available within Fund 7704, Streets and Highways Bond Fund. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget in fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, is necessary to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to authorize the execution of the contract modification as soon as reasonably possible so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the project                      \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into an agreement modification with and to accept contributions from the Central Ohio Transit Authority; to, as necessary, authorize the acceptance of additional funds from the Central Ohio Transit Authority or to return any unused contributions to the same; to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to appropriate funds within the Streets and Highways Non-Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio for the Roadway - LinkUS - Northwest Corridor Phase 2 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $4,500,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Fund and the Streets and Highways Non-Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($4,500,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) intends to contribute funding to subsidize the cost of professional engineering services necessary for the design phase of the Roadway - LinkUS - Northwest Corridor Phase 2 project; and \nWHEREAS, the Director of Public Service must execute an agreement modification, and any amendments or modifications thereto, with the COTA to facilitate the acceptance and expenditure of funding by the Department of Public Service for the aforementioned purpose; and \nWHEREAS, it may be necessary to accept additional funds from COTA if the actual design costs exceed the preliminary cost estimate; and\nWHEREAS, it may be necessary to issue a refund to COTA after final accounting has been performed or after the Department of Public Service certifies that any remaining funds are no longer needed for the project and can be refunded, without the need for additional legislative action; and\n \nWHEREAS, contract no.
