    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the Big Walnut Trail - Winchester Pike to Nafzger Park - Stage 2 Design Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $2,100,000.00.\n   \nBig Walnut Trail’s southern reach is developing into one of the most scenic and accessible greenways in Central Ohio. It will put thousands of residents in the Mid East and South East Communities within a few minutes of access to the trail network. This southern 2.5 mile trail segment will begin at its current terminus at Winchester Pike. It will travel along the greenway corridor to Helsel Park, South Hamilton Road, Refugee Road, and end at Nafzger Park. Neighborhood connections are planned to the Blacklick Estates, Eastland, Cross Creek Village, and Walnut Heights neighborhoods. \n \nThe Stage 2 design contract is a modification to the existing professional services contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. This modification was planned during initial project scoping with the consultant. During Stage 1, the preliminary engineering was completed. It evaluated the options of alignments, environmental survey, crossing details, structures study, and public involvement. This modification covers detailed design and plan completion for the Winchester Pike to Nafzger Park section of the Big Walnut Trail.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nBurgess & Niple, Inc.\n330 Rush Alley, Suite 700\nColumbus, OH 43215 \nJohn Shanks 614-459-2050x1297\nContract Compliance Number: 004425\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 10, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to meet the 2025 Fiscal Year design completion commitments required for grant funds from the State of Ohio that will be used for future construction of the project. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Residents will be able to access trails and key destinations by extending existing regional trail access to several parks and neighborhoods.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community input and public engagement was performed during the Stage 1 contract. Access to trails and key destinations is one of the top rated priorities noted by Columbus residents.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Mid East (57), South East (65)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It will provide equitable and safe access to the trail system for under-served communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $632,468.00 was legislated for the Big Walnut Trail - Winchester Pike to Nafzger Park Project by Ordinance 2562-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $2,100,000.00. $2,100,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $2,732,468.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Big Walnut Trail - Winchester Pike to Nafzger Park Project; to authorize the transfer of $2,100,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $2,100,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
