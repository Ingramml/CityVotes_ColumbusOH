    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into contract with MKSK Inc., in an amount up to $250,000.00, to update the Big Darby Accord Watershed Master Plan.  Approval is requested for reimbursement of preliminary research and preparation expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting November 2, 2024.  The contract will be for a period of twelve months with one optional twelve-month extension.\nThe Big Darby Accord Watershed Master Plan was adopted by the City of Columbus and partner jurisdictions in 2006.  The central objective of the Plan is protecting the Big Darby Creek by balancing conservation and development in a manner that allows for responsible growth and long-term sustainability of the watershed.  \nSignificant steps have been taken since that time to implement the Plan. Overall water quality has improved, hundreds of acres of sensitive natural areas have been acquired.  Riparian corridors have been restored.  Darby-specific stormwater regulations are now in place.  New development has featured best management practices and green infrastructure solutions.  \nWhile the Accord has advanced many of the goals established by partner jurisdictions, changing circumstances call for a strategic reevaluation and update of the plan.  At an October 24, 2024 meeting, Accord partner jurisdictions concurred with the need to revisit the document.  As the convener of the October meeting, Columbus is prepared to lead the update initiative. \nThis legislation allows the Department of Development to engage the MKSK consulting firm for planning services in support of the update.  MKSK was part of the consultant team that developed the current Accord document and is well positioned to undertake this task. Accordingly, the department is asking that competitive bidding be waived.  \nEmergency action is requested in order to expedite the work, thereby ensuring that the Accord remains a current and meaningful guide for development and conservation within the Franklin County portion of the Big Darby watershed.\n \nBid Waiver Request:  A waiver of the competitive procurement requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329.18 is being requested, as MKSK Inc. was part of the consultant team that developed the current Accord document and is well positioned to undertake this task and to maintain the planning timeline.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this agreement is available in the Department of Development’s 2024 General Fund Budget, but will require a transfer between divisions.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the MKSK Inc. vendor number is 028341 and vendor compliance expires on 11/5/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a professional services contract with MKSK Inc. to undertake a strategic update to the Big Darby Accord Watershed Master Plan; to authorize the transfer and expenditure of $250,000.00 from the General Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize expenses incurred prior to the execution of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
