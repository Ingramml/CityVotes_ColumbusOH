    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC for development of 37 units in an amount up to $2,500,000.00.  Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  Juniper Crossing II Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of the project with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC being a loaning member. Approval is also requested for reimbursement of architect, attorney, engineering, and developer fees incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting January 1, 2023.\n \nWoda Cooper Companies, Inc. (“WCCI”) is proposing Juniper Crossing II. Juniper Crossing II is the second phase of an 81-unit senior 55+ affordable housing development consisting of two phases located at 60 Obetz Road in the Far South area in Columbus, Ohio. The first phase, consisting of 44 units, received an award of 9% tax credits from OHFA in the 2023 9% funding round and was the only deal to be funded in the City of Columbus. \n \nThe second phase is utilizing a condominium structure to add an additional 37 units to the three story elevator building. The Council Variance was approved for a total of 81 senior units so this allows the development team to leverage resources efficiently to meet the growing affordable housing demand in the City of Columbus. \n \nJuniper Crossing II will target households with incomes at or below 60% area median gross income. Juniper Crossing II will include twenty (20) one-bedroom units and seventeen (17) two bedroom units for a total of 37 units. The target population for Juniper Crossing II will be seniors. Juniper Crossing II will include the construction of a three-story elevator building with various amenities including: on-site management office, community room with kitchenette, and more. The project is in close proximity to various amenities including Scioto Southland Community Center, ALDI, Kroger, Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging, and a COTA bus stop is located in front of the development on Obetz Road and Southpoint Boulevard.\n \nThe Department of Development was authorized to enter into a Housing Development Agreement for $2,500,000.00 pursuant to Ord 1145-2024 passed on May 6, 2024.  This legislation will confirm the funding for the project.\n \nJuniper Crossing II Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of the project with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC being a loaning member.  The Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC.  City Council hereby authorizes Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC to assign its rights, duties, and obligations under the grant agreement to Juniper Crossing II Limited Partnership, except that Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC shall remain responsible for the indemnification, reporting, and compliance obligations of the grant agreement as set forth in the copy of the agreement on file with the Department of Development.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule and to fulfill financial needs to mitigate additional fees from lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $2,500,000.00 is available in 2024 Capital Improvement Budget, Affordable Housing Bond fund. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project and a transfer of cash is also required.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 0033062 and expires 06/10/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC in an amount up to $2,500,000.00 in support of the development of 37 units of the Juniper Crossing II project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,500,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenditures incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
