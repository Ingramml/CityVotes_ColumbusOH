    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC for development of a 118-unit mixed-use affordable housing development in an amount up to $3,000,000.00.  Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  Granville Woods Lofts Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of the project with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC being a loaning member. Approval is also requested for reimbursement of architect, attorney, engineering, developer, and tax credit fees incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting January 1, 2023.\n \nWoda Cooper Companies, Inc. (“WCCI”) is proposing Granville Woods Lofts. Granville Woods Lofts is the first phase of a proposed 118-unit mixed-use affordable housing development consisting of two phases located at 1826 E. Livingston Avenue on the edge of the Driving Park neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. The second phase received an award of 4% tax credits and gap financing from OHFA in the 2022 OHFA BGF funding round. The first phase will consist of 58 units in a four-story elevator building.\n \nGranville Woods Lofts will target households with incomes at or below 50% to 80% of area median gross income. Granville Woods Lofts will include four (4) one-bedroom units, forty-three (43) two-bedroom units and eleven (11) three-bedroom units for a total of 58 units with 10% of units dedicated to market rate. The development will also feature the commercial/retail space along Livingston Avenue.  The target population for Granville Woods Lofts will be general occupancy. Granville Woods Lofts will include the construction of a four-story elevator building with various amenities including: on-site management office, community room with kitchenette, and more. The project is within steps of COTA bus stops along East Livingston Avenue, across the street from the Driving Park Community Recreation Center, and half a mile from the Columbus Metropolitan Library.\n \nThe Department of Development was authorized to enter into a Housing Development Agreement for $3,000,000.00 pursuant to Ord 1143-2024 passed on May 6, 2024.  This legislation will confirm the funding for the project.\n \nGranville Woods Lofts Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of the project with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC being a loaning member.  The Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC.  City Council hereby authorizes Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC to assign its rights, duties, and obligations under the grant agreement to Granville Woods Lofts Limited Partnership, except that Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC shall remain responsible for the indemnification, reporting, and compliance obligations of the grant agreement as set forth in the copy of the agreement on file with the Department of Development.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule and to fulfill financial needs to mitigate additional fees from lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $3,000,000.00 is available in 2024 Capital Improvement Budget, Affordable Housing Bond fund. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 0033062 and expires 06/10/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC in an amount up to $3,000,000.00 in support of development of Granville Woods Lofts, a 118-unit mixed-use affordable housing development project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $3,000,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenditures incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
