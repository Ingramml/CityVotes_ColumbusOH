($4,168,373.33)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with The Ohio Edison Company for the Fourth Water Plant (FWP) Site Preparation project, CIP #690600-100002, in an amount up to $4,168,373.33. \n \nThe Fourth Water Plant Site Preparation project will design and construct a new water plant (aka Home Road Water Plant) to meet water supply needs and increase the resiliency and reliability of the water supply system. The FWP site is located on City owned property in Delaware County, Concord Township, at the southeast corner of Dublin Road (S.R. 745) and Home Road (C.R. 124).  The address of the FWP site is 8415 Dublin Road, Delaware, Ohio 43065.\n \nOhio Edison is the electric utility that serves the FWP site and surrounding area.  Existing electrical utility lines near the site do not have capacity to supply the water plant’s electrical needs and Ohio Edison must extend an electrical transmission main to the site to meet the FWP’s electrical needs.  To extend the transmission main, the City must enter into a service installation agreement with Ohio Edison. The service installation agreement with Ohio Edison will provide engineering and construction services for the transmission main extension.  The extension will construct approximately 3.3 miles of 138 kV transmission line that will run from Ohio Edison’s existing London-Tangy transmission line to the FWP site.\n \nThis work is anticipated to be performed as part of the Fourth Water Plant Site Preparation project that is currently out for bid, with bids due 11/6/24.  The contractor awarded the contract for this project is to pay Ohio Edison to perform this work.  This payment must be made by mid-February or the permit process will have to begin again with Ohio Edison, which will take a year to complete.  This will substantially delay the construction of the FWP, and the price for the Ohio Edison work will increase substantially if the permit process has to be redone.  The Department of Public Utilities requests this ordinance be approved so the payment can be made by Public Utilities if the contract for the Fourth Water Plant Site Preparation project cannot be awarded in time for the contractor to make the payment to Ohio Edison.\n \nThe Fourth Water Plant will service multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99”, city wide.\n \nTIMELINE:  Upon receipt of the initial payment, design and construction of the line extension will proceed and the work shall be completed within a period of 26 months after receipt of the executed agreement.  The completion of the line extension is anticipated to occur by the 2nd quarter of 2027.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nCosts were developed by Ohio Edison after performing a detailed load study. The City is responsible for 40% of the estimated line extension cost in accordance with Ohio Edison’s line extension policy. The line extension policy is set forth in the Company’s Schedule of Rates for Electric Service, P.U.C.O. No. 11, as approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.  Ohio Edison prepared a price quote for the work and the City’s share of the cost is $4,168,373.33.\n                     \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe City currently has three water plants that collectively provide drinking water to approximately 1.4 million customers in the City of Columbus and surrounding communities.  The existing water plants include the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP), the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP), and the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP).  The FWP will position the City to meet anticipated water system demands and will improve the reliability and resiliency of the water supply system. \n \nSustainable design options shall be evaluated for integration into the project. The evaluation shall result in a set of recommended sustainable design features to carry forward into preliminary design.\n \n3.  SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT\nThis purchase is being made under the Sole Source Procurement section of Columbus City Code (329.19.e).  Ohio Edison is the electrical utility that serves the FWP site and surrounding area.  We must have the work performed by Ohio Edison to have electrical service to the plant.  \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe Ohio Edison Company’s contract compliance number is CC006414 but contract compliance has not been completed.  We will ask Ohio Edison to complete the contract compliance process and become certified.  However, we will need to proceed with the work if Ohio Edison refuses to complete the process as no other entity can perform the work.  \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nA goal of 15% was assigned to the Fourth Water Plant - Site Preparation project by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  This part of the project work must be performed by the utility company and there are no MBE/WBE subcontracting opportunities for this work.  The overall project is still subject to the 15% goal and the requirements of the program.   \n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nOhio Edison is not construction pre-qualified by the City.  This procurement is being made under the Sole Source provision of Columbus City Code so Ohio Edison is not required to be construction pre-qualified.     \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $4,168,373.33 is available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nThe contractor awarded the construction contract for this project is to pay this cost for the City.  This ordinance has been submitted for approval as a back-up plan in case the contract cannot be awarded in time for the contractor to make the payment.  One of the following will occur:\n•                     The contract will be awarded in time for the contractor to make the payment to Ohio Edison and the ACPO assigned to this ordinance will be cancelled.\n•                     The contract is not awarded in time for the payment to be made to Ohio Edison and the City will be reimbursed by the contractor for this expense, and such reimbursement shall be deposited to the Water Bond Fund.\n•                     The contract is not awarded in time for the payment to be made to Ohio Edison and the City will be reimbursed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency or the Ohio Water                                Development Authority as part of the loan that is financing the Fourth Water Plant - Site Preparation project, and such reimbursement shall be deposited to the Water Bond Fund. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with The Ohio Edison Company for the Fourth Water Plant Site Preparation project; to authorize a sole source procurement with The Ohio Edison Company; to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund;
