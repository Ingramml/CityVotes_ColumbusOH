    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to modify its existing contract with Dayforce US Inc., formerly known as Ceridian HCM, Inc, to include subscriptions for Talent module features and guided implementation services. This enhancement reflects the culmination of months of collaborative planning with the leadership team in the Department of Human Resources, fulfilling the Department’s long-term vision for a more integrated and strategic human capital management system. The phased rollout of new functionalities through 2026 will occur at a substantial discount with phased-in pricing, aligning with the city’s commitment to modernization and efficiency.\n \nDayforce was initially selected as the city’s core payroll and personnel system through a competitive process authorized by Ordinance 0848-2019. The system went live in September 2020 and currently serves as the unified platform for payroll, benefits administration, core HR functions, employee onboarding, scheduling, reporting, analytics, and time and attendance. The current contract was authorized by Ordinance 1919-2023, passed on July 17, 2023 and has pricing and services extended for 3 years, subject to annual authorization and appropriation of City Council.\n \nThe city has benefited from this modernization and digital transformation by offering a unified and efficient platform for activities supporting the functions of multiple agencies such as Auditor’s Office, Civil Service, and some Human Resources activities. City employees are able to interact with the system via web and mobile applications to complete activities online such as request time off, view earnings and leave balances, download tax statements, file life and work events for benefits changes, and manage their employee profile information for emergency contacts, direct deposit, tax forms, addresses, and dependents. With the secure and stable cloud-based Dayforce system, the city has enhanced its capabilities for operations, compliance, cybersecurity, data protection, multi-factor authentication, business continuation, and disaster recovery in a continually evolving and up-to-date system.\n \nBuilding on this foundation, the city will expand Dayforce to include Talent module features such as Advanced Hub, Knowledge Base, Case Management, Employee Engagement, Performance, Compensation, and Learning Management. These additions will address current gaps in enterprise-level HR functionality, consolidate disparate systems, and enable a consistent, equitable employee experience citywide. By unifying HR processes and reducing redundancies, this effort enhances data security, simplifies reporting, and streamlines operations, all while delivering real-time, actionable insights to decision-makers.\n \nThe blueprint for this expansion was developed in partnership with the Department of Human Resources and aligns with its strategic vision. The initial focus will integrate HR offerings into an enterprise-level solution, establishing Dayforce as the primary platform for delivering critical citywide information, such as employment policies, benefit plans, and bargaining unit agreements. This unified system will also provide a pathway for additional city agencies to consolidate their HR systems into a cohesive framework, advancing the city’s broader “One-City” objectives.\n \nA phased approach is recommended in recognition of managing the complexity of the scope of work, spreading demand for available resources, addressing organizational priorities, and reducing overall project risk. Working incrementally and delivering value in stages will address critical processes and immediate pain points first, and improve the overall quality of the rollout.\n \nDemonstrations were held for the Department of Human Resources on the functionality available in the Talent suite and the potential to consolidate its systems into a single platform over time. The Director of Human Resources has agreed to move forward with this project to improve the employee experience, fill in gaps in functionality offered city wide, and to achieve system rationalization for functionality. Pricing was determined through negotiations with Dayforce and the pricing offered is a combination of applying city’s existing discount with an end of year pricing promotion offered by Dayforce.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $590,000.00 from the Auditor’s Bond Fund to support the expanded functionality within the Dayforce platform and for professional guided implementation services by Dayforce US Inc. This ordinance also requests a waiver of the relevant competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Section 329 to add these additional services to the current contract. Dayforce is the software developer and the only Software as a Service provider for its products. It is also the current contract holder for the city’s Human Capital Management system. The funding includes contingencies for change management, data integration, and unforeseen project needs, providing flexibility for the project manager to authorize necessary changes or agreements to ensure successful completion. By adopting these enhancements, the city continues to invest in its workforce and infrastructure, setting the stage for future advancements in efficiency, security, and employee engagement.\n \nContract Compliance: \nDayforce US Inc: CC-025904, expires 5/7/2026, D365#025904\nPrincipal place of business:  3311 East Old Shakopee Road Minneapolis, MN 55425USA\n \nFiscal Impact:\nFunds of $590,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Auditor’s Bond Fund, Fund 7783.\n \nFuture operating budgets in 2026 will result in an increase of approximately $3.12 per employee, per month, to the Dayforce subscription (estimated at $410,000.00 annually for 11,000 employees); however, this amount will be offset by an estimated reduction of an estimated $330,000.00 in licensing and support direct expenses for a net impact of $80,000.00 in future budgets while providing a greater degree of functionality, access, security, and coverage across the entire organization.  Greater savings could potentially be achieved by consolidating other systems with similar functionality into Dayforce.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to modify an existing agreement with Dayforce US Inc. for $590,000.00 for software subscription to include the Dayforce Talent module and professional services for guided implementation; to authorize the City Auditor to enter into contract with such additional vendors as may be necessary to complete the addition; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code to enter into such contracts; and to authorize the expenditure of $590,000.00 from the Auditor’s Bond Fund.
