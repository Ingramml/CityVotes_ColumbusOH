    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to add funding to continue professional construction management services with Accenture, LLP dba H.R. Gray & Associates for the Professional Construction Management (PCM) Services #2 project, CIP #650261-102000, in an amount up to $510,945.65.\n \nDue to complications arising on the JPWWTP Facilities Cogeneration construction project, CIP 650250-100007, the construction contract for the Cogeneration project must be extended for a significant timeframe. The  Professional Construction Management (PCM) Services #2 project contract provides construction administration and inspection services (CA/CI) for the Cogeneration project which includes construction inspection, construction coordination, reporting, budgeting, scheduling, document tracking, and related tasks.  Therefore, modifying the CA/CI contract to provide additional funding to continue to provide the construction management services is needed for successful completion of the construction contract.\n \nPlanning Area: 99 - Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $510,945.65\nOriginal Contract   (Ord# 0817-2017)                                                                      $7,399,879.94\nModification No.1 (Ord# 0699-2018)                                                                   $6,451,385.43\nModification No.2 (Ord# 0925-2019)                                                                   $8,235,949.39\nModification No.3 (Ord# 0828-2020)                                                                   $1,962,691.56\nModification No.4 (Ord# 2139-2020)                                                                   $1,122,922.21\nModification No.5 (Ord# 2547-2020)                                                                   $6,006,851.66\nModification No.6 (Ord# 0300-2021)                                                                   $   633,500.00\nModification No.7 (Ord #0909-2022)                                                                   $   325,000.00\nModification No.8 (current modification)                                                   $   510,945.65    \n                     \nCURRENT TOTAL WITH THIS MODIFICATION          $32,649,125.84\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was bid and awarded under the City RFP process to provide the needed services through project completion.  This is a modification to add funding to continue the services due to a delay in the construction project, so another procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined based upon rates and allowable expenses already established in the contract.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe performance of this professional management services contract for the subject construction contracts will help to prevent or reduce number of construction claims, and minimize charges on the amount of the unavoidable claims. Having these services available during start-up is critical to successful implementation of the equipment installed, and ensures contract provisions are followed and a quality product delivered to the City.  No community outreach or environmental factors are considered for this project.\n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nAccenture, LLP’s contract compliance number is CC023429 and expires 9/26/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Accenture, LLP\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Accenture, LLP is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Accenture, LLP anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of one sub-consultant.  The MBE/WBE spend for this contract modification is expected to be 21.0%.  \n \nAs part of their proposal, Accenture, LLP has proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nAscension Construction Solutions                   Columbus, Ohio                                                                            MBE\n \nThe certification of Accenture, LLP and the above company was in good standing at the time the of the contract modification.\n \n5.
