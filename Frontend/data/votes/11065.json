    "title": "To amend Sections 229.03 and 229.04 of the Columbus City Codes to accommodate the electronic filing of domestic partnership declarations, and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance amends Sections 229.03 and 229.04 of the Columbus City Codes, the code sections associated with the city’s domestic partner registry. The current code requires that any two persons “wishing to establish a domestic partnership” must complete and submit a declaration of domestic partnership with the Columbus City Clerk, and do so either in person or via mail. This code change replaces the “in person” and “by mail” options aspect of filing a declaration with “electronically” to accommodate electronic submission of a declaration. This code change also adds an administrative fee to accommodate electronic filing costs.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to align enactment of the code with the establishment of online payment processing in early January.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Sections 229.03 and 229.04 of the Columbus City Codes to accommodate the electronic filing of domestic partnership declarations, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, current Columbus City Code requires that any two persons “wishing to establish a domestic partnership” must complete and submit a declaration of domestic partnership with the Columbus City Clerk, and do so either in person or via mail; and\n \nWHEREAS, this code change replaces the “in person” and “by mail” options aspect of filing a declaration with “electronically” to accommodate electronic submission of a declaration; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the office of the City Clerk in that it is necessarily to immediately enact this code change to align with the establishment of online transactions in early January 2025, NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
