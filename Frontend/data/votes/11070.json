    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the United Way of Central Ohio, Inc., a non-profit corporation, in support of the African American Leadership Academy to provide operational funding.\n \nThe African American Leadership Academy (AALA) is a community-based leadership development program that expands the number of African American leaders excelling in their professions and engaging in community service throughout central Ohio. Its mission is to increase the number of central Ohio African American leaders and broaden the community's awareness of a wider collection of capable and civic minded African American professionals. Founded in 2005, AALA reaches across corporate, non-profit, government, education, and entrepreneurial sectors to form cohorts that explore rich personal and professional development experiences. To that end, AALA assembles a group of Fellows who have the potential for significant accomplishments in both their careers and community. AALA selects individuals who are ready to grow professionally and have a passion for helping the community overcome obstacles and thrive. Each cohort provides Fellows with rich experiences that enhance their professional and personal growth. Fellows graduate with deeper understanding of their own leadership style and strengths. \n \nFurthermore, graduates have a clear strategy for advancing their professional careers and civic contributions. AALA has prepared more than 300 professionals. The curriculum focuses on strength-based management, leadership agility, and making value-added connections.\n \nOver the past ten years, the demand for AALA's Fellowship Program has grown significantly. During the last five years, AALA has received up to five times the number of applications to available slots. Traditionally, the program took 20 Fellows per year. In 2022, the AALA grew from 20 to 40 Fellows with the support of a large gift of $150,000.00 from the Columbus Partnership. Since that time, AALA has continued a two cohort per year model. However, to sustain expanded programming in 2025 (40 Fellows per year), additional funds are needed. The AALA is still receiving four to five times the number of applications to available spots. Sustaining the second cohort per year model will greatly contribute to meeting more of this growing demand.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the United Way of Central Ohio, Inc., in support of the African American Leadership Academy; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($20,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the African American Leadership Academy (AALA) is a community-based leadership development program that expands the number of African American leaders excelling in their professions and engaging in community service throughout central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, AALA assembles a group of Fellows who have the potential for significant accomplishments in both their careers and community; and\n \nWHEREAS, over the past ten years the demand for AALA's Fellowship Program has grown significantly; and\n \nWHEREAS, to sustain expanded programming in 2025 (40 Fellows per year), additional funds are needed; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the United Way of Central Ohio in support of the African American Leadership Academy.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $20,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, to the City Clerk per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $20,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1 of this ordinance, is hereby authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
