    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract renewal for professional engineering services with Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc., for the Stormwater Pump Stations Evaluation & Upgrade Program project, CIP #611660-100000, in an amount up to $300,000.00.\n \nThis project provides for a holistic evaluation of each pump station, assessing their structural, mechanical, process, electrical, and other components, identifying needs and improvements, and identifying risks and safety issues. The evaluation and assessments for each pump station will be summarized into a Technical Memorandum (TM). The recommended improvements listed in the Technical Memorandums will be refined into Improvement Plans that will be used by the City to systematically upgrade the pump stations.\n \nHatch began their work after Notice to Proceed (NTP) was given on 1/24/22. The duration of the engineering agreement is expected to be three years. The professional services shall be funded by incremental appropriation, through the use of annual renewals. This is the second of two (2) planned renewals.\n \nDOSD Stormwater Pump Stations Evaluation & Upgrade Program serves multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $300,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract Amount:               $300,000.00 (ORD 3129-2021; PO308529)\nRenewal #1                                    $300,000.00 (ORD 1611-2023; PO407896)\nRenewal #2                                    $300,000.00 (Current)\nTotal:                                             $900,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was put in place through the City’s RFP process as a three-year contract with annual renewals to add funding.  This is the second of those annual renewals. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe consultant prepared a scope and cost per task based upon current contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.  The cost was then negotiated by the City Project Manager. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe performance of this projects’ activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s Stormwater Pump Stations is needed to plan improvements to maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the sewer collection systems and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nHatch Associates Consultants, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC025646 and expires 2/26/26.\n \n4.
