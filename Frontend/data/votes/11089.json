    "description": "Title\n \nTo recognize and commend Dan Giangardella on his retirement after more than forty-one years of dedicated service to the residents of the City of Columbus.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Dan Giangardella has served the residents of Columbus diligently and honorably for four decades; and,\n \nWHEREAS, from Refuse Collection to Fleet Management to Construction Inspection to the Department of Public Service to Finance to Public Safety, there has not been a city budget since the early 1980s that didn’t have Dan’s fingerprints on it; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, in his forty years of service and leadership, Dan has led hundreds- if not thousands- of employees and added value and impact to countless city initiatives; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, though his roles over the decades have been broad and varied, there have been two constants: Dan’s integrity and his commitment to improving the lives of Columbus residents. (And despite being a hard-working civil servant since the Reagan Administration, Dan somehow hasn’t aged a bit); and,\n \nWHEREAS, we are proud to count Dan as a colleague and friend and are grateful for his stellar work. We can say with certainty that Columbus and its residents are better off for his many years of service, now; therefore   \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nThat it hereby recognizes and commends Dan Giangardella for his forty-one-plus years of diligent and honorable service to the residents of Columbus, and wishes him well in his retirement.\n \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this resolution be presented to Dan Giangardella.",
