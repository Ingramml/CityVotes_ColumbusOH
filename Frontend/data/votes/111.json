    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew (#1) a professional engineering services agreement with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the General Engineering Consultant Services #4 agreement, CIP 650260-100300. The General Engineering Consultant Services (GEC) #4 Project is necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU).  \n \nPlanning Area: 99 \n \nRENEWAL INFORMATION: \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended: $500,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount                   $   425,000.00\nRenewal #1(Current)                                                     $    500,000.00\nCurrent Total                                                     $    925,000.00\n \n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis was an anticipated renewal. It is a planned continuation of the services originally included within the existing contract’s scope of service.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe funding provided by this contract renewal is for continuation of the existing work of the contract. In so much as work was planned for and anticipated within the original procurement, it is not reasonable or cost effective to undertake a new procurement to acquire these services.\n \n1.4. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe cost of the renewal was determined in the original contract and apportioned the work annually.\n2. THE PROJECT TIMELINE: Burgess and Niple, Inc. began work after the notice to proceed was given on January 10, 2020. The contract duration is for four (4) years, starting upon the date of Contract Execution (listed on front page of the Engineering Agreement). The professional services shall be funded by incremental appropriation, through the use of approximately annual renewals. This renewal request is for Contract Renewal #1 and will be $500,000 for 2021 funding. There are two additional planned renewals for this project, December 2021, and December 2022.\n \n3.    EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \n4.    CONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.: 31-0885550 | MAJ | Exp. 2/21/2022 | Vendor # 004425\n \n5. ECONOMIC IMPACT: The performance of this project’s activities is to provide engineering and technical services for CIPs and FEMs at DPU facilities and will help them maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger and more expensive that could produce a major impact to the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.
