    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a construction contract, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with Black Bronco Construction LLC, for the CDBG Neighborhood Facilities Renovation - Carol Stewart Village project, in the amount of $249,000.00 and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in the amount of $2,000.00.\n \nCarol Stewart Village, located at 1551 W. Broad Street, Columbus, OH 43222, is a neighborhood of 62 affordable studio apartments for young adults, ages 18-24, that offers on-site access to transitional jobs, education, health care, mental health and addiction services and social connections through mentorships, peer support and community engagement options.\n \n2. CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The project was let by the Office of Construction Management through Vendor Services and Bid Express.  Of the 518 vendors solicited, 193 were Minority-owned, 2 were Veteran-owned, 310 were Small Business-owned, and 110 were Women-owned.\n \nThe Director of Finance and Management publicly opened three (3) bids on October 4, 2024. One (1) bidder held Minority-designated status.\n                     \n                     Bid Alt.                     Bid\n                     Total                     Total\n1.
