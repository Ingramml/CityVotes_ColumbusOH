    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into contract with Brennan Equipment Services Company dba Brennan Industrial Truck for four (4) forklifts. These forklifts will be utilized by the Department of Finance Fleet Division. RFQ028902 closed on 10/31/2024. There were seven (7) bidders and the award given to the Brennan Industrial Truck Co was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bidder. Octane Forklifts, Inc. did not have any local service or parts for the unit they proposed, Chaves Brothers Management LLC did not include any information with their bid and Cincy Lift Truck & Battery Service does not have local service and parts for the unit and the unit they proposed did not meet the bid specifications. Brennan Industrial Truck Co was the best bid evaluated by responses to bid specifications, length of warranty and available delivery date.: \nCincy Lift Truck & Battery Service. - $142,612.00\nOctane Forklifts Inc.  - $150,600.00\nChaves Brothers Management LLC - $151,599.96\nBrennan Industrial Truck Co. - $159,660.00\nOne Nation Distribution LLC - $171,595.52\nBusiness Bay LLC - $167,996.00\nLogistics 365 Inc - $227,596.00\n \nBrennan Industrial Truck Co. contract compliance number 34-4472715 expires 05/04/2025 \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $145,017.57 from the Fleet G.O. Debt Fund 5205, and the expenditure of $14,642.43 from the Fleet Taxable Debt Fund 5215 with Brennan Equipment Services Company dba Brennan Industrial Truck Co. for four (4) forklifts.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicles to increase in cost as well as limit their availability. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet may ensure the pending purchase and delivery of these vehicles, which will not occur without this additional funding. \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash in the amount of $144,840.70 between projects within the Fleet G.O. Debt Fund; to authorize the transfer of $7,160.73 between projects within the Fleet Taxable Debt Fund; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, with Brennan Equipment Services Company dba Brennan Industrial Trucking Co. for four (4) forklifts; to authorize the expenditure of $145,017.57 from the Fleet G.O.
