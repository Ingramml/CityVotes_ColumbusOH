DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend two (2) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to obtain Automated Side Loading Refuse Vehicles with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC, CC# 008547, pending, and Truck Country of Indiana, Inc. DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, CC# 013531, pending.  These contracts provide for the purchase of Automated Side Loading Refuse Vehicles for the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse.  The contracts, PO309357 with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC and PO309783 with Truck Country of Indiana DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ019697 and will expire December 31, 2024. RFQ019697 did include language to give the City the option to extend the contracts for one (1) additional year, but that language was inadvertently left out of the originally authorizing ordinance, 3096-2021. \n \nNo additional funds are necessary to modify the option contracts as requested.  There is no change in the type of products or services being procured.  The original contract was formally bid.  The original terms and conditions will remain in effect. The Department of Public Service anticipates spending up to $2.5 million dollars under these contracts in 2025. It is in the best interest of the City to extend the contracts an additional twelve (12) months, allowing sufficient time to advertise a formal bid (using the best value procurement process) and establish a new contract to satisfy Refuse Collection Vehicles needed at the Department of Public Services, Division of Refuse.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency to modify and extend the option contracts with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC, PO309357 and Truck Country of Indiana Inc.,  DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, PO309783 for a period of twelve (12) months, from January 1, 2025 to and including December 31, 2025; as the current contracts expire on December 31, 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contracts.  City departments must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \nTitle\nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend the Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Automated Side Loading Refuse Vehicles with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC and Truck Country of Indiana, Inc. DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into two (2) Universal Term Contracts for Automated Side Loading Refuse Vehicles for use by the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend these existing contracts with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC and Truck Country of Indiana DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, to ensure that new and replacement vehicles may still be ordered and purchased; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse, and the current contracts expire on December 31, 2024, it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify and extend the Universal Term Contracts with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC and Truck Country of Indiana DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, for the option to obtain Automated Side Loading Refuse Vehicles, thereby preserving the property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC, PO309357 and Truck Country of Indiana, Inc. DBA Stoops Freightliner-Quality Trailer, PO309783 for a period of twelve (12) months, from January 1, 2025 to and including December 31, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.  \n \nSECTION  3. That for the reasons stated in the Preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after the passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
