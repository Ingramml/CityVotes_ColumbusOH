(“Dominion”) in 2006 pursuant to Ordinance No. 1890-2006 (Rezoning # Z06-045). Under the authority of Ordinance No. 1991-2006, the City and Dominion entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on January 24, 2007 (the “Hayden Run II MOU ”) outlining PAWG commitments and obligations as it pertained to the rezoning.  In 2007, Dominion transferred the Developer Property to the Developer and assigned the Hayden Run II MOU to the Developer pursuant to the limited warranty deed recorded with the Franklin County Recorder’s Office on March 30, 2007 as Instrument No. 200703300054970.\n \nThe Developer has applied to rezone the property pursuant to Rezoning Application # Z23-063 which is currently pending Columbus City Council approval of Ordinance No. 2921-2024 (the “New Rezoning”).  The development proposed under the New Rezoning is more substantial and will require more substantial regional improvements than those contemplated under the Hayden Run II MOU.  Therefore, pursuant to the New Rezoning, the Developer is required to execute a new agreement with the City to affirm updated PAWG commitments and obligations.\n \nIn following the City's Northwest PAWG policy to generate revenue that will pay for regional improvements, the Developer shall: 1) support the inclusion of the Developer’s Property within one or more Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Districts to be established by the City in accordance with Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”) 5709.40; 2) make one-time per unit contributions of up to $1,700 for up to the maximum number of 2,050 units constructed, which may be reduced for credit given to account for land conveyances and regional improvements; and 3) take all necessary steps to establish the Jameson Estates Community Development District in accordance with R.C. Chapter 349 (the “Authority”).  The Developer shall encumber the Developer Property with a Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions (the “Declaration”) for the District that shall require each current and future owner of all or any portion of the Developer Property to pay an annual Community Development Charge, as such term is defined in Section 349.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, to the Authority in an amount of no less than 0.004 multiplied by the \"Assessed Value\" of such property for a minimum period of twenty (20) years commencing one (1) year after the date of completion of the construction of each residential structure (as evidenced by a Certificate of Occupancy).  Within ninety days of the execution of the Pay as We Grow Agreement, the Developer will take all necessary steps to establish the Authority, including, without limitation, filing a petition with the Clerk of Council.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to terminate the Hayden Run II MOU and enter into a Pay As We Grow Agreement (“PAWG Agreement”) with the Developer to outline the plans and respective commitments of the City and Developer for the fulfillment of Northwest PAWG requirements as it relates to the Developer Property.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Pay As We Grow Agreement with Western Property LLC for fulfillment of Pay As We Grow requirements for property located at 5141 Cosgray Road, subject to Rezoning Application # Z23-063, and to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding with Dominion Homes, Inc., as it relates to said property.
