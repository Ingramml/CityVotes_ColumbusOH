    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to amend the Capital Improvement Project Grant entered into with The Ohio Historical Society doing business as (DBA) Ohio History Connection.  An amendment is needed for the purpose of allowing additional time to complete construction on exterior and interior preservation and renovation, as well as, site work and landscaping for Poindexter Village.\n \nColumbus City Council, per Ordinance Number 2612-2022, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement in an amount up to $1,400,000.00 with The Ohio Historical Society DBA, Ohio History Connection, to provide a capital grant supporting construction on exterior and interior preservation and renovation, as well as, site work and landscaping for Poindexter Village.  Columbus City Council subsequently authorized the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio Historical Society, Inc. (DBA), as Ohio History Connection, in the amount of $20,000 for the purpose of providing a grant to support architectural cost for construction on the exterior and interior construction preservation and renovation.  The architectural cost were not included in the capital improvement project grant. The Department of Development wishes to extend the $1,400,000.00 capital improvement project grant by an additional year to allow for the project's completion.\n \nBecause the project was delayed due to funding needed for architectural cost, an extension of one year is requested to finish the project.\n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of the additional funds to be expended is $0.00.\n2.                     The Department of Development could not predict/did not anticipate the delay of the project.\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to extend the grant term to allow for construction completion.  It is not possible to award the grant to another organization for the interior/exterior renovation and landscaping of Poindexter Village. \n4.                     There is no additional funding involved with this modification, and thus, no basis of price for additional goods or services (as there are none).\n \n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the amendment to occur before the current grant agreement ends of 12/31/2024.  \n   \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation does not have a fiscal impact.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 006096 and contract compliance expires on 10/13/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Capital City Improvement Project Grant with The Ohio Historical Society, DBA, Ohio History Connection, to amend the capital improvement project grant agreement authorized by Ordinance No. 2612-2022 to allow the grant to end on December 31, 2025 instead of December 31, 2024; and to declare an emergency. \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council, per Ordinance Number 2612-2022, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement in an amount up to $1,400,000.00 with the Ohio Historical Society DBA Ohio History Connection to provide a capital grant supporting construction on exterior and interior preservation and renovation, as well as, site work and landscaping for Poindexter Village; and\n \nWHEREAS,  Columbus City Council, per Ordinance Number 1363-2024, on June 3, 2024, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Ohio History Connection, in the amount of $20,000, for the purpose of architectural services in the exterior and interior construction preservation and renovation for Poindexter Village; and\n \nWHEREAS, the architectural cost, including marketing, was not included in the grant agreement of $1,400,000; and\n \nWHEREAS, the amendment is needed to extend the end date of the capital improvement project grant agreement authorized by Ordinance Number 2612-2022 to December 31, 2025, instead of December 31, 2024 to allow additional time to complete construction on exterior and interior preservation and renovation, as well as, site work and landscape in Poindexter Village; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exits in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Development to amend the capital improvement project grant agreement with Ohio Historical Society, Inc.
