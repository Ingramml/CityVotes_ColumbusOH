    "description": ".Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with the Short North Alliance, Inc. (SNA) to contribute funding for various public parking initiatives within the Short North Parking Benefit District. \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, in order to facilitate additional parking and mobility options partnered with the Short North Alliance, Inc. to implement parking and mobility programs. These programs increase access for all user groups and support the growth and development of the Short North. These programs include visitor parking validation, employee mobility benefits, marketing and communication, transit focused incentives and administration.  \nThe visitor validation program meets the goal of increasing occupancy at off-street garages in the Short North and maximizing off-street parking supply. The employee mobility benefits fund provides a pool of funds that are used to provide mobility benefits to employees and reduce parking demand and traffic congestion in the Short North, specifically within the neighborhood and on permit streets. The Short North Marketing & Communications program advocates for and educates the public on transportation and parking options through print and online media and in the form of signage on-street. The SNA will administer programs related to parking and mobility for the Short North Parking Benefit District. The SNA will administer a program providing free fares for transit trips on COTA buses. This program will dedicate funds to employees, visitors, and residents to provide a free month of transit trips. A study will be conducted on the Mobility Options in order to find solutions that will increase walking, biking, and use of public transit within the Short North.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $300,000.00 in the Mobility Enterprise Fund, Fund 6500.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with the Short North Alliance, Inc. to provide funding for various public parking initiatives within the Short North Parking Benefit District; and to authorize an expenditure of $300,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund.  ($300,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with the Short North Alliance, Inc.
