($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) establish a reasonable and safe prima facie speed limit on Feder Road from Alton and Darby Creek Road to Hilliard-Rome Road.\n \nAn engineering study conducted along Feder Road by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 supports decreasing the speed limit from 45 miles per hour to 40 miles per hour on Feder Road from Alton and Darby Creek Road to Hilliard-Rome Road.  The Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, reached the same conclusion after conducting its own investigation.\n \nThe Franklin County Board of Commissioners recently passed a resolution requesting ODOT investigate and determine a safe speed limit at this location. It is now necessary for the City of Columbus to enact similar legislation because a portion of Feder Road lies within City limits.\n \n2. Fiscal Impact\nThere is no fiscal impact to the City as a consequence of the passage of this legislation. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation establish a reasonable and safe prima facie speed on Feder Road from Alton and Darby Creek Road to Hilliard-Rome Road; to repeal any and all speed limit ordinances and resolutions on said roadway. ($0.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the current prima facie speed limit on Feder Road from Alton and Darby Creek Road to Hilliard-Rome Road is 45 miles per hour; and\n \nWHEREAS, an engineering study conducted by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office determined that a speed limit reduction would be appropriate at the aforementioned location; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 provides for the establishment of a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit under such conditions by ordinance enacted by a local authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, reached the same conclusion after conducting its own investigation; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 provides for the establishment of a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit by the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation upon request from a local authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Franklin county Board of Commissioners recently passed a resolution requesting ODOT investigate and determine a safe speed limit at the aforementioned location; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary for the City of Columbus to enact similar legislation because a portion of Feder Road lies within City limits; now, therefore,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation determine and declare, based upon the recommendation of the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, that the prima facie speed limit be lowered to 40 miles per hour on Feder Road from Alton and Darby Creek Road to Hilliard-Rome Road on the basis of traffic engineering studies and investigations conducted under the direction of professional engineers.\n \nSECTION 2. That any and all previous speed limit ordinances and resolutions on Feder Road from Alton and Darby Creek Road to Hilliard-Rome Road, be and are hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
