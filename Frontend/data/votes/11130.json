    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:  The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Melissa L. Grawe, asking that the City transfer them a 0.024 acre portion of the Whittier Avenue right-of-way.  Right-of-way area is unimproved and is adjacent to the parcel at and near to 1513 E Whittier Street i.e. PID = 010-080937 and 010-080936.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will be to allow incorporation of the right-of-way with the adjacent parcels and create off-street parking for their personal use and to have access to the rear of their property.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $3,135.00 for the portion was established.  This value is at a reduced easement retention value.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on September 19, 2024.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Melissa L. Grawe at the cost of $3,135.00 and a general utility easement will be retained.  \n                     \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:  The City will receive a total of $3,135.00 and the funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of 0.024 portion of Whittier Avenue right-of-way to Melissa L.
