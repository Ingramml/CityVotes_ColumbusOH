    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Design Workshop, Inc. for the Columbus Recreation and Parks 2025-2035 Master Plan Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $8,561.00.\n   \nThe Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD) executed a contract with Design Workshop for CRPD's 10 Year Vision Plan development.  The original contract did not have contingency within the project but identified potential areas for add-on services. This modification is intended to accept an add-on service. The modification amount of $8,561.00 was determined by billable hours and agreed-upon reimbursables that were in the original contract. \n \nCRPD and Design Workshop developed the concept for \"polling\" at the Community Centers in order to increase engagement with youth and families less likely to complete a 15 minute online survey. It was also the intention to capture feedback from households less likely to have access to technology and or may have language barriers. Design Workshop created 5 exhibit boards, as well as, provided training material and supplies to CRPD in order to initiate this work at 28 community centers. The survey designed to capture these metrics was more complex and took longer than originally anticipated. The Department needed this option to capture people, especially young people, and those with challenges with technology, language, and/or families not able to respond to a 15 minute online survey. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDesign Workshop, Inc.\n125 South Clark Street, Suite 660\nChicago, Illinois 60603\nAnna Laybourne, (321) 360-1736\nContract Compliance Number: 048712\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: April 4, 2026\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will collect information from the community and departmental staff that will result in maximizing services for residents.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Columbus Recreation and Parks Master Plan is largely based on input from the community.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will create the next 10 year Master Plan.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $790,080.00 was legislated for the Columbus Recreation and Parks 2025-2035 Master Plan Project by Ordinance 1045-2024.
