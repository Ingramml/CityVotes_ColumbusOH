    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with Student Success Stores, a non-profit corporation with the goal to meet the basic needs of students from economically disadvantaged communities, and to remove barriers to learning that can be created when life necessities are unavailable. \nStudent Success Stores has been providing students with free school supplies, personal hygiene products, nutritional food, school-code clothing, and more since 2016. Currently, there are two Student Success Stores that are serving the Envision Hilltop plan area at Wedgewood and Hilltonia Middle Schools. In addition to these two schools, the Student Success Store team has found success in distributing school supply and hygiene kits at elementary schools and libraries to provide additional levels of support for Hilltop students and families beyond the middle school level.\nFunding from the City of Columbus Department of Neighborhoods will be used to support Goal 4 of the Envision Hilltop community plan. Goal 4 of the plan is to “Position schools as community hubs and expand on-site wraparound services.” By providing funding for the two existing Student Success Stores on the Hilltop and for the distribution of school supply and hygiene kits beyond the middle school level, the City has an opportunity to directly support the basic needs of children on the Hilltop.\nThis support is in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 that relate to not-for-profit service contracts.
