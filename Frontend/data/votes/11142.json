The FNC Delivery Program provides the distribution of food boxes (35-40 pounds per household) to those vulnerable residents who are unable to utilize services at a traditional food pantry due to a variety of reasons - lack of transportation, physically disabled, lack of resources, homebound, etc. The program runs five days a week, delivering food boxes to over 250 households per week. \nIn April 2021, the FNC Delivery Program continued the services previously provided by the EasyMiles Automated Shuttles; which were delivering St. Stephen’s Community House FNC food boxes to Rosewind Community Center and surrounding area. The program currently uses SSCH vehicles to deliver the food boxes; employ staff to operate the program; and input all data into PantryTrak. This funding will be used to continue payroll and administrative costs for pantry assistants and delivery drivers.\nThe City of Columbus Department of Neighborhoods has been a supporter of the FNC since 2022. Funding from the City of Columbus Department of Neighborhoods will be used to support the One Linden Community Plan Big Idea to “Support Resident Health - Consider alternative ways to get fresh/healthy foods to households”.
