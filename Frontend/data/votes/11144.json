($0.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to contract with Delta Dental Plan of Ohio, Inc. to update Exhibit A for the period January 1, 2025 through February 28, 2025; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                      That the Director of the Department of Human Resources is hereby authorized to enter into a contract modification with Delta Dental Plan of Ohio, Inc. to update Exhibit A for the period January 1, 2025 through February 28, 2025, which is incorporated herein by reference, to align with changes resulting from collective bargaining.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
