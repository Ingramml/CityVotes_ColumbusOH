    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to enter into contract with The Educational Service Center of Central Ohio (on behalf of Franklin County Family and Children First/Partnership4Success).  Partnership4Success (P4S) is a collective impact backbone entity designed to organize, align, and mobilize stakeholders and providers for the purpose of providing crucial supports and learning to providers of youth services in Franklin County.\n \nFor the 2024-2025 school year, P4S will serve youth service providers as a resource hub and collective impact convener for exchanging information between and among providers, funders, and school districts. P4S will leverage their existing relationships to deepen and expand partnerships by coordinating educational opportunities and youth service programming in response to the unprecedented crises exacerbated by a global pandemic. The P4S collective impact approach is designed to position all stakeholders to align around a common equity-driven agenda.\n \nThis ordinance will fund a portion of the foundational P4S work, including:\n \n1.                     P4S Community of Practice.  P4S will provide partners access to a comprehensive toolbox of social emotional assessment technology and implementation resources tailored to the unique context of each provider setting;\n2.                     P4S Work Groups & Workshops.  P4S will convene workgroups and workshops on six different focus areas: Adult SEL, Data & Continuous Improvement, Family & Community Engagement, Middle & High School Youth, Youth & Young Adult Workforce Readiness, and Young People of Color; \n3.                     P4S Facilitator Project. The P4S Facilitator Project initiative will increase the number of skilled facilitators to lead equity-centered collective impact that increases social, emotional, and academic outcomes; \n4.                     Adaptive Schools - Organizations Foundation Seminar.  This seminar will  present a productive, practical set of ideas and tools for developing collaborative groups in becoming effective and better equipped to resolve the complex issues associated with improving social, emotional, and academic outcomes for young people; \n5.                     Cognitive Coaching.  The P4S Cognitive Coaching supports individuals and organizations in becoming self-directed, self-monitoring, and self-managing. Participants learn tools for building trust and rapport alongside coaching interventions that support critical self-reflection; and\n6.   Social Emotional Development for Youth & Young Adults.  The research linking social-emotional development (SED) and workforce readiness is robust (Harvard Business Review, 2022; NAPE Education Foundation, 2020; ASPEN, 2019). Working with young adults requires intentional efforts to strengthen social-emotional development in ways that lead to career pathways with family sustainable wages.\n \nThe Office of Education requests the authority to enter into a new contract with ESCCO/P4S to provide the same services for the 2024-2025 school year as they did the previous year.  This contract will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329.30. No city employee has either the capacity or experience to engage in this work.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $70,000.00 from the 2024 Mayor’s Office of Education’s general fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into contract with The Educational Service Center of Central Ohio (on behalf of Franklin County Family and Children First/Partnership4Success); and to authorize the expenditure of $70,000.00 from the general fund.
