    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Human Resources to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee (CALMC) for the provision of training and assistance to promote improved labor-management relations and to add funds for payment of services.  At the time of the initial contract, the interim executive director thought $25,000.00 was all they would require to promote labor-management relations.  In October 2024, it became evident that CALMC would require additional funding to continue to train and assist to help improve labor-management relations.  The request for an additional $25,000.00 would allow the organization to continue services until the end of the contract term.  \n \nIt is in the best interest of the Department of Human Resources to continue to work with CALMC, as both parties have a long-standing partnership dating back to the 1990s.  The price of services was determined through the need of additional training and assistance.  These additional services were not anticipated at the time the contract was authorized earlier this year.  Procuring separately for these services is not appropriate given the existing contractual relationship and long-standing partnership with CALMC.\n \nOrdinance 1254-2024 authorized the Department of Human Resources to enter into a service contract for the provision of training and assistance to promote improved labor-management relations in the amount of $25,000.00.  The contract term expires on March 31, 2025.\n \nThe Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee is a not-for-profit organization that promotes the development of high-performance organizations through joint participation of labor and management. Since its founding in 1986, CALMC has worked with many private and public sector companies and organizations and their unions to help them achieve their goals through the active involvement of its members and through effective training, communications, and leadership to benefit the citizens of Central Ohio. City Council has supported CALMC in the past by making strategic investments in projects that will ultimately create and retain jobs within the City.\n \nIn addition, CALMC assists employers and employees in working together in areas such as problem-solving, team building, and leadership, which increases employees' skill levels so they will be more employable, have a voice in workplace operations, and enhance the leadership abilities of both current leaders and future leaders.  These services require expertise that cannot be provided by current city employees.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Human Resources to add funds to pay for services provided in the contract in the amount of $25,000.00.\n \nThe original contract amount:                     $25,000.00                     (PO464357, Ord 1254-2024)\nThe total of modification 1:                     $25,000.00                     (This Ordinance, Ord 3374-2024)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                                          $50,000.00\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against the Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee.\n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee’s contract compliance number is CC-004788 and expires on 12/2/2026.\n \n3. FISCAL IMPACT \nFunding is available for this contract within the Fund 5502 (Employee Benefits Fund), Subfund 550201 (Administration).\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure payment for theses services can continue to prevent a service interruption.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of the Department of Human Resources to modify the not-for-profit service contract with the Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee for the provision of training and assistance to promote improved labor-management relations and to add funds; and to authorize the expenditure of $25,000.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund for this contract; and to declare an emergency.
