    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to modify a not-for-profit service contract with I Know I Can by extending the contract.\n \nOriginal Agreement                                                               $1,200,000.00                                          Ord. 2991-2023\nModification No. 1                                                               $            0.00                     \nTotal Agreement Amount                     $1,200,000.00\n \nOn October 30, 2023, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 2991-2023 which authorized the Office of Education to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with I Know I Can, a local non-profit corporation, to provide Columbus Promise programming to Columbus City Schools students.\n \nThe contract authorized in 2023 expires on December 31, 2024. This contract extension will extend to December 31, 2025. The modification will allow I Know I Can to continue their work promoting participation to the thousands of Columbus City Schools seniors that it serves and supporting FAFSA completion for these students.\n \nEvaluation under this contract is ongoing and funds have not been exhausted as of December 2024. This contract modification will allow for the continuation of the evaluation without interruption. I Know I Can has served as the student support organization and program promotion coordinator for the Columbus Promise since its inception, and closing and/or rebidding this contract at this time would be detrimental to a streamlined experience for the members of Columbus City Schools Classes of 2025 and 2026 who are actively working with I Know I Can to prepare for college through the Columbus Promise.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the contract modification to be executed prior to the contract’s expiration.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to modify a not-for-profit service contract with I Know I Can by extending the contract; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2991-2023 was passed by Columbus City Council in October 2023, authorizing a contract with I Know I Can to provide Columbus Promise programming to Columbus City Schools students; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Education seeks to extend the contract to allow for ongoing Columbus Promise promotion and support to Columbus City Schools students within the existing scope of service; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify this contract in order to extend the contract before it expires on December 31, 2024 and continue Columbus Promise programming for Columbus City Schools students, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THERFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Office of Education is hereby authorized to modify a not-for-profit service contract with I Know I Can by extending the contract to December 31, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
