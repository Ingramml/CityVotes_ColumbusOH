The Tony R Wells Foundation will act as the Temporary Housing Coordinator’s fiscal manager to dispense funding to enable temporary accommodations. Assistance may include temporary housing costs and essential relocation assistance expenses. .\n \nThe VTS, partners make program eligibility determinations to qualify residents for funding to ensure housing stability and the Temporary Housing Coordinator will, in turn, inform the Tony R Wells Foundation which temporary accommodations are approved for funding and how much.  \n \nFunding for this program focuses on assisting displaced tenants from unsafe, unsanitary or inhabitable housing conditions.  The Tony R Wells Foundation will make the payments directly to the recipients or other entities on their behalf.  As such, funds will be advanced to the Tony R Wells Foundation.  \n \nUnder this agreement, funding is included for recipients’ needs and a fee for the Tony R Wells Foundation acting as the fiscal manager.  \n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of the additional funds to be expended is $150,000.00.\n2.                     The Department of Development could not predict the rate at which the initial funds would be expended to meet the needs of the community’s most vulnerable residents.\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to continue with the Tony R Wells Foundation’s current contract as they are the acting fiscal manager partnered with the VTS Temporary Housing Coordinator. \n4.                     The amount of this modification is based on the availability of funds and not a pricing strategy.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to have funding available as soon as possible to assist residents who are displaced and need immediate assistance for transitional housing to prevent homelessness, especially during the upcoming winter months.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided by the Department of Building and Zoning Services from the Development Services Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s number is 038668 and expires on 06/22/2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $150,000.00 to provide assistance to individuals facing housing instability; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $150,000.00 from the Development Services Fund; to authorize advance payments per a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
