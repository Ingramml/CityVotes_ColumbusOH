    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The ordinance authorizes a purchase order with Axon Enterprise Inc for the Division of Police.  The Columbus Division of Police is seeking to purchase five small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) otherwise known as drones.  One sUAS will be designated as a trainer and the other four will be designated for Patrol use. The purpose and use for this purchase is to provide additional aerial observation support for use by Patrol Officers. Due to limited flight times and speeds of the sUAS, they cannot do many of the jobs assigned to the Division Helicopters, but the sUAS can be beneficial in static localized searches and aerial observation of large gatherings during downtown festivals or races. As the program matures, additional tasks for using sUAS will be incorporated, to include assisting with the documentation of large outdoor crime scenes or significant automobile accidents scenes, as well as using drones to assist our tactical teams during hostage/barricade situations.  \n \nOur community and citizens will benefit by having additional aerial observation capabilities available to Patrol Officers when the Division Helicopters are unavailable or busy on other tasks. \n \nBid Information:  RFQ019158 was advertised and Best Value Procurement proposals were received on August 12, 2021.  Six (6) responses with pricing were received.  After a thorough evaluation of the proposals received, The Finance and Management Department entered into contract with Axon Enterprise, Inc.   The Finance and Management Department established an option contract (UTC) with this company.\n \nContract Compliance:  \nAxon Enterprise Inc; CC038851, expires 03-27-2026\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $172,000.00 from the Law Enforcement Contraband Seizure Fund Budget, for the purchase of Drones, Software and accessories for the Division of Police from the Universal Term Contract established by the Department of Finance and Management. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement with Axon Enterprise Inc for the purchase of Drones, Software and accessories for the Division of Police; to authorize the expenditure of $172,000.00 from the Law Enforcement Contraband Fund.
