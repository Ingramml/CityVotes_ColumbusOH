    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Administrative and Presiding Judge to enter into contract with StepMobile, LLC, for a new mediation case management system and authorizes the expenditure of up to $116,000 from the general fund. \n \nThe Franklin County Municipal Court Dispute Resolution Department provides mediation services for the court and the public. Mediation is a way to resolve disputes outside of a courtroom with the help of a neutral mediator. The mediator helps parties exchange information and proposals through negotiation. Mediation is private, and the mediator can document an agreement in writing for the parties to resolve a case. The current case management system is outdated, causing significant delays in the mediation process. The proposed new case management system will modernize the current system and implement more efficient processes, helping to ensure that all cases referred to the program are mediated quickly and efficiently. This software will integrate into the Court’s current OCSS system, facilitating the conversion of mediation files to e-filing and digital files.\n \nThis was not bid out as this new software will interface with existing software created by this company -OCSS. OCSS was a State initiative related to Senate Bill 86 and the Court is required to use the State program.  Per the State of Ohio - Ohio Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation this is a sole source vendor as they are contracted with StepMobile to design a program specific to the State.\n \nStepMobile’s Federal Tax Id is 47-3459867.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funds are available within the 2024 general fund for this purpose.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into contract with StepMobile LLC; to authorize the expenditure of $116,000 for a new mediation case management system from the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges Fund, in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Code. ($116,000)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Court has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into contract with StepMobile so that the new system will be integrated with the existing OCSS system; and\n \nWHEREAS, $116,000 is needed to provide for services; and\n \nWHEREAS, StepMobile is the sole provider of any changes to the OCSS system; and\n \nWHEREAS, in the usual daily operation of the city, in that it is necessary to enter into contract and authorize the expenditure for a new mediation case management system with StepMobile; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
