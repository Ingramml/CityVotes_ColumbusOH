($399,730.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to modify an existing contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a comprehensive records management system (RMS).  This modification is necessary to adhere to the agreed upon scope of services and installment pricing. In 2023, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, published a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a comprehensive records management system (RMS). In the past, the Division of Fire has maintained separate contracts for records management services. The goal of this RFP was to contract with a company that can provide a comprehensive record management system that meets all of the City’s technology requirements and provides all of the necessary incident report platforms. After evaluation, in compliance with the Revised Code of the State of Ohio, the Charter of the City of Columbus, Columbus City Code Section 329.28 and Title 39, the selection committee recommended entering into contract with ImageTrend, LLC for the records management system.\nThis contract modification is necessary to add funding to continue providing EMS and Fire Incident reporting, in addition to fire inspection reporting software. Each year, the Columbus Division of Fire (CFD) responds to over 170,000 calls for service. Each EMS incident requires an incident report to be completed in a compliant format that meets national standards (NEMSIS 3.4). That information creates a permanent patient record that is maintained by the Division of Fire. This report is used as justification for EMS transport billing, which generates approximately $20M annually in revenue for the City's general fund. The incident reports are also used to share information with local hospitals and are referenced for continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts to ensure the Division of Fire maintains a high level of EMS/pre-hospital care. Also, each fire incident is required to have an incident report completed in NFIRS 5.0 format that meets national standards. That information is maintained as a public record and is submitted to the Ohio Fire Marshal’s office and the US Fire Administration to provide data for the national fire incident database. Additionally, each commercial occupancy and multi-family occupancy space is inspected on an annual basis. The Fire Prevention Bureau inspects over 35,000 buildings to ensure they maintain compliance with the Ohio Fire Code and the Local City Fire code. The Fire Prevention Bureau also issues permits for various fire code requirements. All of this data and information is maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. ImageTrend, LLC's product performs all of the above functions, along with providing various record keeping modules. These record keeping of data and information helps in maintaining inventory of various tools, supplies and other items for the Division of Fire. \n \nSUPPLIER: ImageTrend, LLC, Vendor No.: 023084; FID: 41-1903871. \n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nThe total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification is $399,730.00.  The total contract cost including this modification is $639,720.45.  The need for additional funds was known and provided for at the time of the initial contract.  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original contract and no other changes in pricing and/or conditions are anticipated at this time.  The cost was determined through the vendor's original RFP response.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes payment of the remaining balance of $399,730.00 to ImageTrend, LLC for the comprehensive records management system.  Any future contract modification or extensions will be authorized in subsequent ordinances.  Funds are available within the Department of Public Safety's 2024 General Fund Budget for this contract modification.  \n \nEmergency Designation: This ordinance is being processed as an emergency measure in order to meet the project timeline of issuing a Purchase Order thereby preventing interruption of this vital service.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to modify an existing contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a comprehensive records management system; to authorize the expenditure of $399,730.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($399,730.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, has a continuing need for a comprehensive records management system (RMS) that meets all of the City’s technology requirements and provides all of the necessary incident report platforms; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, request a modification of an existing contract with ImageTrend, LLC to add funding for the records management system; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Public Safety Director to modify an existing contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a comprehensive records management system and to meet the project timeline of issuing a Purchase Order thereby preventing interruption of this vital service, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
