Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 0200-2023.  \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the contract rates and job titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each job title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage projects include rehabilitation of existing sewers, repair to existing sewers, construction of new sewers, and construction of green infrastructure.  The majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nResource International, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004197 and expires 1/30/2026.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and ODI did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  Resource International, Inc. is classified as a WBE company by ODI.  As shown in the Utilization Plan attached to this ordinance, Resource International, Inc. does not plan to use any subconsultants on this task.  MBE/WBE participation for this modification is projected to be 100.00%.  \n \nResource International, Inc.’s certification was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Resource International, Inc., for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; and to expend up to $62,341.50 from the Sanitary Bond Fund for the modification.  ($62,341.50)  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities advertised a Request for Proposals for Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services; and\n \nWHEREAS, Resource International, Inc. was one of six firms selected by the evaluation committee to provide these services; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0200-2023 authorized the contract with Resource International, Inc. for these services and assigned the first tasks to be performed; and\n \nWHEREAS, additional construction inspection/administration tasks need to be performed; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract with Resource International, Inc. will need to be modified to add these tasks to the contract and to add funding to pay for the tasks; and\n \nWHEREAS, an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project; and \n \nWHEREAS, funds must be expended to pay for the construction administration and inspection services Resource International provides under the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1907-2024 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change \n6109 / P650870-100005 / Cooke/Glenmont Integrated Solution (Voted Sanitary Carryover) / $83,575.00 / $21,233.00 / ($62,342.00)\n \n6109 / P650870-100801 / Blueprint Hilltop - Palmetto/Westgate (Voted Sanitary Carryover) / $0.00 / $62,342.00 / $62,342.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of Public Utilities is authorized to enter into a contract modification for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract with Resource International, Inc., 6350 Presidential Gateway, Columbus, Ohio, 43231, for construction administration and inspection services, in accordance with the terms and conditions as shown in the contract on file with the Department of Public Utilities, in an amount not to exceed $62,341.50.\n \nSECTION 3.
