    "description": "...Background\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing construction contract for 2022 Utility Cut Restoration Project with Decker Construction Company to add $800,000.00 in funding to the contract. Various types of utility excavations are performed within the City of Columbus' right-of-way and City owned properties by the Department of Public Utilities.  The restoration work typically involves repair of existing pavement, curbs, and sidewalks in a manner conforming to the City of Columbus, Construction and Material Specifications (CMSC).  The Department routinely outsources this restoration work to a contractor that is equipped and trained to make these repairs.  Typical types of restoration work that require outsourcing involve the installation of wheelchair ramps, asphalt repair involving thermal bond heat weld repairs, asphalt milling machines capable of full width milling, and the delivery of flowable controlled density fill using volumetric mixer trucks.\n \nCONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The Director of Public Utilities publicly opened one bid (RFQ023112) on November 9, 2022 from Decker Construction Company. \n \nDecker Construction Company's bid was deemed the lowest, most responsive and responsible bid.  Their Contract Compliance Number is #004549 (expires 11/3/2025, Majority).  Additional information regarding this bidder, description of work, contract time frame and detailed amount can be found on the attached information form.  The contract contains a multi-year renewal option.\n \nThe original contract was established in accordance with the pertinent provisions to waive for competitive bidding of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code and authorized with Ord. 3224-2022.

Total amount including this contract renewal is $5,230,000.00. This contract shall not automatically renew. All other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect.
