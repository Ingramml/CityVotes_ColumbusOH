    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Dynotec, Inc. for the Blueprint Winthrop / Milton Area Integrated Solutions Project, CIP #650870-110161, in an amount up to $537,846.12.\n \nThis project is required to comply with Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s consent order requiring mitigation of Design Sewer Relief (DSR) activations to the 10-yr level of service.  The City proposes to accomplish this via elimination of inflow and infiltration into the sanitary sewer system, and the construction of green infrastructure to capture and treat the resulting stormwater runoff.\n \nTo date, the consultant has conducted the required field investigations, property investigations, and alternative analysis to determine the preferred alternative within the project area. The consultants have used this data for the report and to assemble the 30% plans. They are currently working towards their 60% plan submittal.\n \nFuture work will concentrate on finalizing the project construction plans, assembling the construction documents, bidding the work, and conducting engineering services during construction.\n \nThis work will occur in the Clintonville area, with the project limits bounded by Whetstone Park of Roses and Brighton Rd on its northern and southern extents. It will be bounded by N. High Street and the Olentangy River on its eastern and western extents respectively.\n \nThe Community Area for this project is 39 - Clintonville.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $537,846.12\nCost summary: \nOriginal Engineering Agreement   (ORD 3332-2016; PO051397)           $1,072,507.46\nModification No.1 (current)                                                                   $537,846.12 \nModification No. 2 (future)                                                                    $200,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                        $1,810,353.58\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bidding the project will likely result in higher costs, as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by a new consultant unless the same consultant wins the new RFP. In such a case, we would have lost significant time in acquiring and evaluating new proposals without substantial benefit.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by Dynotec, Inc., based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly systems, commonly referred to as “green” infrastructure, has been recognized and implemented in many communities as a potential solution to various elements associated with EPA consent order requirements. Green infrastructure also provides additional stormwater treatment benefits, potentially mitigating street flooding and impacts on receiving streams.\nIt is anticipated that the construction of green infrastructure will positively impact the local economy by creating the need for personnel to construct and maintain the proposed facilities, as well as by sourcing project-related materials from local suppliers and vendors.  Community outreach for the project will be conducted by the City via public meetings upon completion of draft plans.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nDynotec, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC005053 and expires 2/12/26.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Dynotec, Inc. is classified as an MBE by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  As part of their proposal, Dynotec, Inc. has proposed two subcontractors to perform contract work.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 60.23%.\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nms consultants, Inc.                                       Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ                                \nDonahue IDEAS, LLC                                  Columbus, Ohio                                               WBE\n \nThe certification of Dynotec, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized submitting loan applications and acceptance of loan funding through this program via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This project was not one of the projects listed as anticipated to be funded through this loan program when Ordinance 0652-2024 was approved.  However, Section 2 of the Ordinance stated projects can be added to the list per departmental need without seeking Council approval to change the list.  Council approval for this loan is requested via this ordinance.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA January Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application.\n \nBudget authority exists for this project in the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget under Fund 6124, the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund.  Funds will need to be appropriated and expended in the Sanitary - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124, for this project.  \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Dynotec, Inc. for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Dynotec, Inc. and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Dynotec, Inc. for the Blueprint Winthrop / Milton Area Integrated Solutions Project;
