    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. for the DOSD Sanitary Pump Station SA-13 Evaluation & Upgrade Project, CIP #650660-100013, in an amount up to $417,248.79.\n \nThe initial phase of this contract provided Professional Engineering Services for Preliminary Design (Step 1). This phase, the second phase, will provide Professional Engineering Services for Detailed Design and Bidding Services (Step 2). The third phase will provide engineering services during construction (Step 3).\n \nThe scope of work for this project will generally include a complete assessment, evaluation, and refurbishment of Sanitary Pump Station SA-13 so that it can remain in service for the next 20 years with only routine maintenance. The building structure and the systems and equipment within may need refurbishment to some degree, including but not limited to pumps and motors, electrical and power generating equipment, security systems, instruments and controls, wet well structures, the sewer pipes within the boundaries of the site, electrical cabling and duct banks, parking lots, grounds and fences, and HVAC systems. This refurbishment must bring the pump station into compliance with all current building and safety codes. \n \nStep 1 of this project, Preliminary Design, included the following tasks: 1. A review of the existing pump station, 2. A condition assessment and evaluation of the existing pump station, 3. Identification and evaluation of design alternatives, 4. Development of design criteria and basis of design, and 5. Preparation of a Detailed Design Memorandum / Preliminary Design Report (PDR) / Condition Assessment Report. \n \nThis phase will request a modification (Modification No. 1) to the Professional Engineering Services Agreement to provide funding for Step 2, Detailed Design. Detailed Design will prepare construction contract documents (including specifications and drawings) in accordance with City of Columbus Division of Sewerage and Drainage standards, guidelines, and direction for construction and implementation of the proposed facility. Detailed Design also includes plan and specification review meetings, assisting in negotiations, permitting, and other matters with the Ohio EPA and other government agencies as necessary, and bidding services (which includes assisting at the Pre-Bid Meeting, reviewing the bids, making an award recommendation to lowest and best bid, and preparing Conformed to Contract construction documents.)\n \nUpon award of the construction contract, another modification will be requested to fund Step 3, engineering services during construction, which will include Technical Project Representation (TPR) duties, construction phase engineering, start-up and commissioning assistance, and record documentation.\n \nThe Community Area for this project is 59 - Southwest.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $417,248.79\nCost summary: \nOriginal Engineering Agreement   (ORD 0498-2022; PO324991)              $231,539.23\nModification No.1 (current)                                                                    $417,248.79 \nModification No. 2 (future)                                                                     $406,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                         $1,054,788.02\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was initiated through the City’s RFP process and intended to take the project from preliminary design through construction with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications.  Another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by AECOM Technical Services, Inc, based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe performance of this project’s activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s Sanitary Pump Station SA-13 is needed to plan improvements to maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the collection system and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nAECOM Technical Services, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC010897 and expires 5/28/26.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  AECOM Technical Services, Inc is classified as a majority owned company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  As part of their proposal, AECOM Technical Services, Inc. has proposed four subcontractors to perform contract work.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 35.01%.\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nHazen and Sawyer                                       Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ                                \nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.        Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nDynotec, Inc.                                               Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE                               \nCTL Engineering, Inc.                                  Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\n \nThe certification of AECOM Technical Services, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA January Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application.\n \nThe 2024 Capital Improvements Budget will need to be modified to align budget authority with the proper project;
