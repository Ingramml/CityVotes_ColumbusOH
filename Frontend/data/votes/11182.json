    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for engineering services during construction with Arcadis US, Inc. for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Facility project, CIP #650250-100007, in an amount up to $962,500.00.\n \nThe Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant creates large amounts of methane rich digester biogas which is now burned in flares as a waste product.  A recent feasibility study shows that installing a cogeneration system can beneficially use this biogas as fuel to create electricity that will supply about half the total electricity the plant uses, with an acceptable payback period and significant overall reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The cogeneration system will be relatively large and complex.  This project also includes design work for replacing certain plant boilers at the end of their useful life and installing office space.\n \nPreliminary design and detailed design were completed. Modification 3 was intended to progress the work through the end of construction. However, due to construction delays of more than a year and a half, a new modification is required. This current modification will complete remaining engineering work and progress through the duration of construction. A separate construction project is underway and is expected to be completed by second quarter of 2025, and all engineering work will also be complete at that time.\n \nPlanning Area: 99 - Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $962,500.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                           $1,025,883.00 (ORD 1329-2017 PO071394)\nModification #1 Amount:                                              $2,309,950.00 (ORD 2924-2018 PO152817)\nModification #2 Amount:                                            $1,299,989.00 (ORD 0926-2021 PO279978)\nModification #3 Amount:                                              $1,907,793.00 (ORD 0951-2022 PO 332296)\nModification #4 Amount:                                              $962,500.00 (current)   \nTotal (Orig. + Modification):                                              $7,506,115.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nIf this phase of the project were bid out it would result in inefficiencies and added fees, while attempting to bring a new consultant up to speed on the design.  The design team that performed the other phases of design have key technical knowledge regarding the design intent which is required for technical representation during construction.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined based upon rates and allowable expenses already established in the contract.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project provides design work to install a cogeneration system that will use the facility’s biogas, now burned in flares as a waste product to create large amounts of electricity.  The updated lifecycle cost analysis from preliminary design show a savings in electrical costs, which helps to offset the capital and operating costs of the improvement.  A detailed feasibility study shows a large overall reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions.  The system will reduce overall greenhouse emissions by more than 4,000 tons a year of equivalent CO2.\n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nArcadis US, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC009409 and expires 2/22/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis US, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Arcadis US, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Arcadis US, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of one sub-consultant.  The MBE/WBE spend for this contract modification is expected to be 0.0%.  \n \nAs part of their proposal, Arcadis US, Inc. has proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nBrown and Caldwell                                                              Columbus, Ohio                                                                            MAJ\n \nThe certification of Arcadis US, Inc. and the above company was in good standing at the time the of the contract modification.\n \n5.
