    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to start detailed engineering design services with DLZ Ohio, Inc., for the Broadview Road 30-Inch Transmission Main project, CIP No. 690502-100002, in an amount up to $616,928.13.  \n \nThis contract is for engineering consulting services for the design of a water distribution transmission main that will extend from a 48-Inch Transmission Main in the North pressure district along Cherry Bottom Road at the Broadview Road intersection to a connection point in the City’s existing water distribution system, specifically the Morse pressure district.  \n \nThe initial contract, Phase 1, was for preliminary design services. During this phase, 3 different alignment options were evaluated for feasibility, constructability, cost and impacts to the environment and the adjacent communities.  The alignments evaluated included one along an AEP Electrical Transmission Easement area located directly south of the Blendon Woods Metro Park property.  Another alignment evaluated would go South on Cherry Bottom Road and then East along Morse Road to the Morse Tanks. The final alignment evaluated involved going along Broadview Rd to the Morse Tanks through a proposed easement located along the parcel currently occupied by Kohl’s near the Hamilton Road & Morse Road intersection.  After an initial assessment, the Broadview Road alignment was found to have the lowest cost, best feasibility and constructability, and least environmental and social impacts.  Phase 1 focused all Geotechnical and Subsurface Utility Exploration (SUE) efforts on this alignment.\n \nThis modification is the first of two planned contract modifications to add funding.  This modification is for Phase 2, detailed design services. The second planned modification is for Phase 3, services during construction. \n \nThis contract modification will provide funds for the consultant to undertake detailed survey and design efforts of the Broadview Road 30-Inch Transmission Main alignment. It will also provide funds for 52 additional SUE pot-holes, an additional 8 Geotechnical bore holes and reports as well as survey and coordination efforts related to acquiring a new Easement. \n \nAll of the transmission main will be located inside the City of Columbus, specifically in the Rocky Fork-Blacklick - 33 Community. \n \n \n1.1.  Updated Timeline\nDetailed Design Services (Modification 1) is expected to have a duration of approximately 24 months.  Engineering Services during Construction (Modification 2) is expected to have a duration of approximately 36 months.  \n \n1.2.  Estimated Contract Cost\n \nCost summary: \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $616,928.13\n \nOriginal Contract - Preliminary Design                                                                   $   483,898.01 (PO405922, ORD 1932-2023)\nModification No. 1 - Detailed Design                                                                    $   616,928.13 (Current)\nModification No. 2 - Services during Construction                       $   250,000.00 (Estimated)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                   $1,350,826.14 (Estimated)\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nDLZ Ohio, Inc.  provided a cost proposal as requested by the City based on the current contract rates for job titles, allowable expenses, and overhead.  The fee proposal was reviewed by the Division of Water and deemed to be acceptable.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will ensure a sufficient and resilient water supply for the future demands that are projected in the North-East portion of the distribution system.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nDLZ Ohio, inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004939 and expires 3/15/26.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against DLZ Ohio, Inc. \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place with an ODI determined MBE/WBE program goal of 15.0%.  DLZ Ohio, Inc. is classified as a MBE company and anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this contract modification is expected to be 87.67%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, DLZ Ohio, inc. has proposed the following subconsultants to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                               City/State                                          ODI Certification Status \nBrown & Caldwell                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nDHDC                                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                               MBE\nStone Environmental                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                               WBE\n \nThe certification of DLZ Ohio, inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis design modification is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized the application and acceptance of funding through this program via Ordinance 0859-2024, passed by Council on 4/15/24.  This was not one of the projects specifically listed in the ordinance as anticipated to be funded with this loan type.  Section 2 of the Ordinance states projects can be added to the list without amending the original ordinance.  This ordinance will request City Council’s approval to loan fund this specific project.  The loan is expected to be approved in January, 2025.  This project is contingent on the WSRLA loan being approved by the OWDA Board.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.  \n \nThe 2024 Capital Improvement Budget must be amended to align budget authority with the amount of the loan.  It is necessary to appropriate funds in the amount of $616,928.13 in Fund 6011 (Water Supply Revolving Loan Fund).\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract modification with DLZ Ohio, inc. to add funding for the Broadview Road 30-Inch Transmission Main project;
