    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes additional funds, in an amount up to $30,000.00, to be spent by the City Attorney for expenses associated with acquiring the right-of-way needed for the Cooke Road Culvert Improvements Project, C.I.P. No. 611702-100000.   \n \nThe City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) is engaged in the Cooke Road Culvert Improvements Project, C.I.P. No. 611702-100000 (“Public Project”).  This project is being undertaken to repair an existing 21-inch corrugated metal storm sewer south of Cooke Rd. at Eastlea Drive and to repair a collapsed 6-inch clay storm sewer along the west property line of 503 E. Cooke Road.  DPU is also investigating ways to implement ditch improvements to increase the capture of Cooke Road storm water runoff at the upstream end of the sewer.  \n \nThe City must acquire in good faith and accept certain fee simple and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of East Cooke Road and Overbrook Drive (collectively, “Real Estate”) in order for DPU to complete the Public Project.  Accordingly, DPU requested the City Attorney to acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) in order for DPU to timely complete the Public Project. \n \nOrdinance 1634-2023, approved by City Council on 6/26/23, authorized the original funding for the Real Estate acquisition.  It is now necessary to add additional funding in order to complete the acquisition of the Real Estate for the Cooke Road Culvert Improvements Project.  Exhibits and legal descriptions were attached to the previous ordinance showing the details of the easements and temporary easements planned to be acquired for this project.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nNot applicable. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $30,000.00 for this expenditure are available in the Storm Bond Fund, Fund 6204.
