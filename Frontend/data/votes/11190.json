    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 2845-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on November 18, 2024, to allow for a correction of the name of the subrecipient, correct the agreement type, allow for advance payments, and allow for contract modification to address additional risks (if any) identified during the contract term without having to return to City Council for approval.\nOrdinance No. 2845-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on November 18, 2024, authorized the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute a sub-recipient agreement with the Human Service Chamber of Franklin County for the commercial energy audit and technical assistance program. \n \nDuring contract negotiations, it was discovered that the 501(c)4 agency name was inadvertently listed, rather than the vendor's 501(c)3 agency name. The federal grant funding of this contract allows subawards only with 501(c)3 agencies. The correct agency name for this contract is The Human Service Chamber Foundation. Additionally, the city agreement type used for a federal subaward should be a Subrecipient Agreement - Not-for-Profit Service Contract, and the agreement will be structured for payment of advance funds from the City on a predetermined schedule throughout the term of the contract, as was requested by the City and approved by the US Department of Energy in the grant application. Finally, to address any potential risk that may arise during the term of the service agreement, the City seeks approval to modify the contract without returning to City Council for approval, only for purposes of addressing risk, not for changes to the scope, term, or funding. This permission is needed when utilizing federal funds because the City is required to evaluate and monitor for risk before and during the term of the contract. If the level of risk changes during the term of the contract, the City has an obligation to institute controls to reduce the risk, such as requiring additional reports or management responsibilities. This allows the Director to modify the contract for risk issues only, allowing for efficient management of federal funds.\n \nEmergency Justification:\nEmergency action of this ordinance is requested so that the amendments made are effective when Ordinance No. 2845-2024 is effective.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nThe Human Service Chamber Foundation\n966 S. High Street\nColumbus, OH 43206\n(614) 429-4238\nContract Compliance Number: 028003\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: 10/21/2026\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 2845-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on November 18, 2024, to allow for a correction of the name of the subrecipient, correct the agreement type, allow for advance payments, and allow for contract modification to address additional risks, if any, identified during the contract term without having to return to City Council for approval; and to declare an emergency.
