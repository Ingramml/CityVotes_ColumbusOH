Additionally, the Division requires assistance during the implementation of the City’s new revenue management system to ensure that federal tax information is properly safeguarded during the data conversion and transition processes. \n \nDue to the Division’s review of other vendors through the 2020 request for proposals process, AED’s gained knowledge of Division operations, and AED’s success in evaluation and preparation for the 2021 IRS review, the Division is requesting to waive the request for proposal requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \nContract Compliance: The vendor contract compliance number is 33027 and is valid through 7-8-2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the 2021 General Fund Budget.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to expedite authorization of this contract in order to facilitate and maintain uninterrupted services from the supplier.\n \nWaiver of Request for Proposal Requirements: A waiver of the request for proposal requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is being requested to contract with a firm that specializes in compliance with IRS Publication 1075 requirements, and has intricate knowledge of existing Division safeguarding practices.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to execute a professional services contract with AED Advisers, LLC. in an amount up to $115,000.00 for the purpose of providing advisement on the Division’s compliance with federal tax information safeguarding requirements as required in IRS Publication 1075; to authorize an expenditure up to $115,000.00 from the General Fund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of City Code Chapter 329; and to declare an emergency ($115,000.00).\n \n \nBody\n \n \nWHEREAS, the City Auditor desires to work with AED to provide advisement on the Division’s compliance with federal tax information safeguarding requirements as required in IRS Publication 1075; and \n \nWHEREAS, federal tax information is a critical audit resource to ensure city tax compliance and revenue optimization; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the City's best interests to waive the competitive bidding requirements of City Code Chapter 329 because AED has intricate knowledge of Income Tax Division operations and IRS Publication 1075 requirements; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Division of Income Tax in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to execute a contract with AED Advisers for the continuation of professional services, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1: That this Council finds that it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code to enter into this contract.\n \nSECTION 2.
