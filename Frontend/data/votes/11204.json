    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background: This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify the contract with BOMAR Construction Company, Inc., for the Professional Construction Services - Task Order Basis project, authorized by Ordinance No. 1892-2024. \n \nThe Invitation for Bid required a performance and payment bond in the minimum amount of 50% of the contract amount as required by Columbus City Code 329.14(a)(2).  This is a City requirement for all construction contracts expected to cost $100,000.00 or more (329.14(a)).\n \nThe Departments of Finance and Management and Public Safety set up a contract with BOMAR Construction Company, Inc. in the amount of $1,500,000.00. \n \nThe Department of Finance and Management would like to modify the contract to change the contract term from “The term of the contract is one year from the date of issuance of the purchase order, with the option for up to three (3) annual renewals” to “The term of the contract is one year from the date of issuance of the purchase order, or, until all funds are depleted, with the option for up to three (3) annual renewals\".\n \n2. Waiver:  BOMAR Construction Company informed the City the cost of the bond would be at least $46,000.00.  The Department also seeks to modify the contract performance and payment bond requirement by removing such requirement as the tasks to be assigned under the contract will be under the $100,000.00 threshold established in 329.14 of Columbus City Code.\n \nSection 329.15 of Columbus City Code, Waiver of Regulations, requires that City Council find it in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of Chapter 329. The Department believes this waiver to be in the best interests of the City in order to realize the $46,000.00 in savings that may then be used for other tasks under this Task Order Basis project.\n \nUpon Council approval the Department will issue a contract modification removing language in regards to the contract performance and payment bond as well as the contract term.\n \n3. Modification Info:\n \n             A. The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification:   \n     N/A; additional funding is not needed.\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \n       Additional goods and services are not being requested.  The Department is seeking to remove contract language no longer applicable to the performance and payment bond, as well as updating the contract term.\n \n C. Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\n      The contract has already been through the Invitation for Bid process.  Pricing was not included in the award of the contract, therefore, the removal of the bond language and change of contract term is not relevant to a new bidding process.\n \nD. How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \n     N/A; additional funding is not needed.\n \n4. Emergency Designation:  It is requested that this Ordinance be handled in an emergency manner in order to process the contract modification expeditiously to allow for the assignment of important construction tasks.\n \n5. Fiscal Impact:  N/A\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management; to modify the contract with BOMAR Construction Company, Inc., for the Professional Construction Services - Task Order Basis project; to waive competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency.  ($0)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Finance and Management Department, Office of Construction Management, desires to modify the contract for the Professional Construction Services - Task Order Basis project with BOMAR Construction Company, Inc.
