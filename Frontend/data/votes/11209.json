For the segment of the corridor where Williams Road intersects Norfolk Southern and CSX rail lines, the City intends to pursue funding for a grade separation from the Federal Rail Administration (FRA) via the Railroad Crossing Elimination Program. As such, services for that segment will follow the FRA Guidance on Development and Implementation of Railroad Capital Projects, and this contract is planned to be used through all the Project Lifecycle Stages as described in the guidance. Each Lifecycle Stage would not be advanced until FRA approval in order to be reimbursable under grant requirements.
