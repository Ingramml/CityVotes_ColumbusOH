    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an agreement with Tri County Tower, LLC for removal, decommissioning, and disposal of an existing radio tower and design and construction of a new tower on property owned by the City of Columbus at 6502 E. Broad St.\n \nThe Department of Public Safety currently has a radio tower mounted on top of a water tank at 6502 E. Broad St.  The Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water, plans to repaint the water tank in 2025.  The Department of Public Safety will be required to remove their radio tower from atop the water tank as part of this planned project.  When comparing costs of renting a temporary radio tower and eventually mounting the existing tower back on the water tank vs. constructing a new radio tower, the Department of Public Safety determined that it will be more cost effective in the long run to construct a new radio tower.  This radio tower is part of the Division of Support Services' telecommunications network which provides critical 800 MHz communication services throughout the City of Columbus for public safety forces. \n \nA committee comprised of employees from the Department of Public Safety's Director's Office and Division of Support Services solicited quotes from various qualified vendors for this project.  Tri County Tower, LLC quoted a total cost of $373,224.30, which includes $90,000.00 in contingency funding, which may be needed depending upon the results of the core sampling and soil analysis. Hayden Tower Service quoted a total cost of $449,339.00.  Motorola quoted a total cost of $793,568.00.\n \nBid Information - This purchase is recommended to be made with a waiver of formal bidding requirements, due to the deadline for project completion and the vast difference in pricing between the quotes received.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested because of the need to get this agreement implemented as soon as possible due to the upcoming painting project.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $373,224.30 to enter into an agreement with Tri County Tower, LLC. Funds are available in the Safety G.O. Bonds Fund for this purpose. \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Safety G.O. Bonds Fund, Fund 7701; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an agreement with Tri County Tower, LLC for removal of an existing radio tower and design and construction of a new radio tower; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $373,224.30 from the Safety G.O.

Bonds Fund, Fund 7701, for this project; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Support Services, Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into an agreement for the removal, decommissioning, and disposal of an existing radio tower and design and construction of a new tower on property owned by the City of Columbus so not to delay the upcoming painting project, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
