    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC, via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) Sludge Concentration Building Demolition project, CIP #650260-102018, in an amount up to $2,217,600.00; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $2,219,600.00.\n \nThis is a contract for the demolition of the sludge concentration tanks and rehabilitation of the portion of the building to remain.  The portion of the Sludge Concentration Building (SCC) building added as an annex to the control building has been abandoned since the sludge concentration tanks were removed from service.  The control building roof has begun to deteriorate, along with some other structural issues, which will be addressed to stabilize this building.  The work consists of removal of the sludge concentration portion of the building and the sludge concentration tanks, rerouting centrate piping, rehabilitation of the remaining building along with adding a new roof on the north portion of the remaining building to protect existing electrical systems and control equipment within.  \n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 59, Southwest.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 290 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $2,217,600.00, including a 20% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                         $2,217,600.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                        $0.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                                  $2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                 $2,219,600.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe portion of the Sludge Concentration Building (SCC) building added as an annex to the control building has been abandoned since the sludge concentration tanks were removed from service. The control building roof has begun to deteriorate, along with some other structural issues, which will be addressed to stabilize this building. Removal and replacement of the failed equipment, electronic and electrical components, would be a major impact to the budget. \n \nNo community outreach impact is considered for this project. Public informational meetings were not required because all proposed work is within the boundaries of the wastewater treatment plant. Regulatory agencies have been notified of the proposed work as appropriate.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis opportunity was advertised on the City’s Vendor Services website and on Bid Express from 7/23/24 through 8/21/24.  One bid was received as follows:\n \nCompany                                                 Bid Amount                Compliance Number           ODI Status \nSehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC             $2,217,600.00                        CC048042                         MAJ\n                      \nThe Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $2,217,600.00.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nSehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC048042 and expires 3/12/26.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC  \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 0% for this contract as this was the only bid received after two bids. \nSehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC listed the following company as a subcontractor for this project:\n \nCompany Name                                                City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nEnvironmental Demolition Group, LLC                Erlanger, KY                                              MAJ\n \nThe certification of Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC and the above company was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nSehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC was not pre-qualified at the time of bid opening.  Even though they are now pre-qualified, a waiver of the relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 with respect to pre-qualification must be approved to contract with them.   \n \n7.  BID WAIVER:  This project was advertised in March and April of 2024 with no bids received.  It was re-advertised in July and August and received one bid.  During evaluation of that bid, it was determined that Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC was not a pre-qualified construction vendor.  Sehlhorst Equipment Services, LLC agreed to apply for construction pre-qualification and has since become pre-qualified.
