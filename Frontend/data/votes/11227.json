Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 0859-2024, passed by Council on April 15, 2024.  The loan is expected to be approved in January, 2025.  This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.

administration for the project.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction
