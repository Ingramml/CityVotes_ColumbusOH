    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Automatic Meter Reading Project, CIP #690358-100000, in an amount up to $1,200,000.00.\n \nIn 2015 the Department of Public Utilities awarded a contract to EMA, Inc. through the City’s Request for Proposal process to develop and recommend a strategy, roadmap, and plan for implementation of an Advanced Metering System (AMS) for water and electrical meters.  The contract was for the entire process anticipated to last several years and to consist of the following phases:\n \nPhase 1:  Develop an AMS System Roadmap \nPhase 2:  Prepare an AMS system RFP\nPhase 3:  Coordinate an AMS System Vendor Selection Process\nPhase 4:  Provide program management assistance during the implementation.\n \nUnder Original Contract No. EL017444 authorized by Ordinance 1597-2015, the Department of Public Utilities contracted with EMA, Inc. to assist in Phase 1 of the contract which was to develop and recommend a strategy, roadmap, and implementation plan of an Advanced Metering System (AMS) for water and electric meters. Under this phase, EMA, Inc. evaluated state-of-the-art AMS technologies; evaluated and compared cost impacts; developed a detailed implementation schedule; and assisted the City in budgetary planning efforts.\n \nModification No. 1 occurred in May 2017 to procure Phase 2 Services, which included preparation of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an AMS system that clearly defined the City’s objectives and requirements.  \n \nModification No. 2 occurred in June 2019 to provide Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services, which included coordination of the AMS System vendor selection process, assisting the City in negotiating the technical requirements of the project so a final scope and cost could be determined for the project solution, and program management assistance. \n \nModification No. 3 occurred in October 2021 to provide continued Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services.  This included coordination of AMS business process development, program management assistance during the implementation of the project, and coordinating the system installation, system interface development and testing plans.\n \nModification No. 4 occurred in November 2022 to provide continued Phase 4 Services. These services included continued program management assistance during implementation from Proof of Concept through mass meter installations, introduction to the customer portal, vendor management, area management, continued public outreach communications, installations inspections, and reporting. \n \nModification No. 5 occurred in November 2023 to continue providing Phase 4 Services. This included continued program management assistance during implementation from Proof of Concept through mass meter installations, introduction to the customer portal, vendor management, area management, continued public outreach communications, installations inspections, and reporting. \n \nModification No. 6 (current) is a planned modification to continue providing Phase 4 Services. Due to the volume of meter installations, this phase is projected to last the remainder of the project and will need annual funding through the project completion.\n \nFuture modifications were anticipated and expected as outlined in Ordinance 1597-2015 and further explained in Ordinance 0797-2017, Ordinance 1847-2019, Ordinance 2572-2021, Ordinance 2746-2022 and Ordinance 2906-2023.\n \nThe planning area is “99 - Citywide” as this project serves multiple planning areas.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:  An Automatic Meter Reading System for the Water Supply Group will be provided under a professional services agreement.  As stated in Ordinance 1597-2015, the original contract was to run until the funds were expended and have additional funding modifications.  This modification is anticipated to be executed in the first quarter of 2025 to provide funds for projects until all funds are expended, which is estimated to be approximately one year from the Notice to Proceed.  The contract is expected to last through January 2027, but may need to be extended if installation of the meters is not completed by then.  \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,200,000.00\nOriginal agreement:                     $369,077.71  (EL017444)\nModification No. 1:                     $550,000.00  (PO065223)\nModification No. 2:                     $750,000.00  (PO218378)\nModification No. 3:                     $750,000.00  (PO304311)\nModification No. 4:                     $750,000.00  (PO359482)\nModification No. 5:                     $1,200,000.00 (PO428040)\nModification No. 6:                     $1,200,000.00\nTotal to Date:                     $5,569,077.71\n \n 1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a planned modification as indicated in the original authorizing legislation, Ordinance No. 1597-2015, as well as the modifications under Ordinance No’s 0797-2017, 1847-2019, 2572-2021, 2746-2022, and 2906-2023.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nModifications to the agreement were planned as part of the original Request for Proposals RFP.  Additionally, the current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the work to-date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will further delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by EMA, Inc. based upon pricing consistent for job titles and tasks already performed under the contract.  The proposal was reviewed by Department staff and deemed acceptable.\n \n2.  FUTURE CONTRACT MODIFICATION(S)\nDue to the volume of meter installations, this phase is projected to last the remainder of the project and will need annual funding through the project completion, which is estimated to be January 2027.\n \n3. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nAn AMS program is favorable to DPU’s operations and customer service functions, as replacing older water and electrical meters will improve service, decrease burden on maintenance operations, reduce water loss, and improve revenue.  Moving from quarterly to monthly billing will have a positive impact on customers as the bills will be more manageable in both cost and time.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nEMA, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC007843 and expires 10/16/25.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against EMA, Inc.\n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  EMA, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the attached Utilization Plan, there are four subcontractors planned to be used on this contract and one subcontractor is certified as a WBE by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is anticipated to be 2.74%.
