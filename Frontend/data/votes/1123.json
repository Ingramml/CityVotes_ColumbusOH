IKIC achieves its mission, “to inspire, enable, and support Columbus students to pursue and complete a college education,” by focusing service efforts around three critical junctures for students: early awareness of college and career opportunities, postsecondary access, as well as summer melt prevention and postsecondary persistence. \n \nBased on current predictions, COVID-19 has caused significant disruptions to graduation rate gains among historically disadvantaged students who made strides in high school graduation rates across the country pre-pandemic.\n \nFunding is requested to provide high school students with multiple opportunities over the summer to engage in productive educational activities, along with college and career readiness, in safe environments with a focus on their futures.\n \nThe Department of Education requests the authority to enter into grant agreements with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio (WDBCO).  WDBCO will contract with I Know I Can CCS, a not for profit organization, to administer these various summer programs.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of up to $5,855,232.00 from funding provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan that was passed by Congress on March 10, 2021 and signed into law on March 11, 2021.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency designation is requested to ensure that the funding can be provided to the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio and I Know I Can CCS as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Education to enter into grant agreements with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio for various summer programs that provide credit recovery, post-secondary education preparation, career readiness, and youth employment programs for high school students; to authorize the expenditure of up to $5,855,232.00 from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($5,855,232.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio (WDBCO) is a non-profit with a focus on partners with area businesses and organizations on workforce needs so that people are fully employed at their ability and potential in the thriving Central Ohio economy; and\n \nWHEREAS, I Know I Can (IKIC) has been the anchor organization for college access in Columbus, with recent expansion into additional Franklin County districts; and \n \nWHEREAS, funding is requested to provide high school students with multiple opportunities over the summer to engage in productive educational activities, along with college and career readiness, in safe environments with a focus on their futures; and\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to graduation rate gains among historically disadvantaged students who made strides in high school graduation rates across the country pre-pandemic; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the expenditure of American Rescue Plan funding for The Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio and I Know I Can CCS, not for profit entities, is crucial for our economic recovery, necessary due to the COVID-19 public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into grant agreements with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio in support of various summer programs, all for the preservation of public health, peace, property, and safety; and\n \nWHEREAS, such expenditure of funds has not been previously accounted for in the 2021 Budget; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
