    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance establishes a single-point repository for reporting information to the Fire Prevention Bureau concerning fire protection systems. Currently, the information must be maintained by the owner or occupant of property at which a fire protection system is utilized. Certified Fire Safety Inspectors (“CFSI”) from the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire rely upon the information maintained onsite to determine whether or not the fire protection systems are maintained in accordance with the Ohio Fire Code and Title 25 of the Columbus City Codes. If the owner or occupant fails to maintain the required information, then the CFSI does not know whether or not the fire protection system is operable and the extent of any deficiencies. The single-point repository for information allows contractors that provide services, testing, installations, repair, and maintenance of fire prevention systems to submit the required information directly to the Fire Prevention Bureau. Thus, the single-point repository will facilitate fire safety inspections, the repair of inoperable or deficient fire protection systems, and fire code compliance. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Section 2501.07 of the Columbus City Codes to establish a single-point repository for reporting information to the Fire Prevention Bureau concerning the installation, maintenance, testing, and inspections of fire protection systems; and to repeal existing Section 2501.07.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, an objective of the Division of Fire is to ensure that fire protection systems are operable, not deficient, and comply with the Ohio Fire Code and Title 25 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, a modification to Section 2501.07 is necessary to improve the operations of the Division of Fire to protect the health and safety of Columbus residents; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend Section 2501.07 of the Columbus City Codes to accomplish this goal, NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Section 2501.07 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended to read as shown on the attachment to this Ordinance. \n \nSECTION 2. That existing Section 2501.07 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed. \n \nSECTION 3. That the obligation to enroll and utilize an approved single-point repository service company (“SRSC”) pursuant to amended section 2501.07.1 shall take effect 120 days following the effective date of this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
