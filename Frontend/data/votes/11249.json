    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:  The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Knot Your Bus LLC, asking that the City transfer them a 0.090 Acre portion of the Leonard Avenue right-of-way for the purpose to incorporate this property into planned construction improvements for adjacent properties. Right-of-way area is unimproved and is adjacent to the parcel at and near to Leonard Avenue. (PID 010-055122).\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will be to allow incorporation of the right-of-way with the adjacent parcels for improvements.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $7,840.00 for the portion was established.  This value is at a reduced easement retention value.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on October 17, 2024.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Knot Your Bus LLC, at the cost of $7,840.00 and a general utility easement will be retained.  \n                     \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The City will receive a total of $7,840.00 and the funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nEmergency Justification \nEmergency action is requested, due to the short construction season in Ohio. This will allow the deed to be recorded as soon as possible, so the County can combine the lots and issue parcel numbers, allowing the development to proceed, certified addresses to be issued, construction of proposed roads, homes/buildings to be built. Additionally, it will allow the inspection and Construction Agreement to be finalized with the City.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of 0.090 acre portion of Leonard Avenue right-of-way to Knot Your Bus LLC; and to declare an emergency.
