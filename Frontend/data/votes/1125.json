    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground  For the past 20 years, the YMCA of Central Ohio has been dedicated to, and significantly engaged with, youth in Franklin County.  The organization identifies that there is more work to be done and guidance to be given as gun violence increases, academic successes wane, and youth fall victim to street and drug dealings.  These trends are alarming as they increase the chances of both incarceration and learning gaps for youth. It is clear that youth and young adults need academic support, emotional development, and options for success.  \n \nThe YMCA’s Fresh Start Program will address this need by serving at-risk youth ages 15-18 with social and emotional development, continued education, vocational skills / job acquisition, pro-social activity, social support, substance abuse, and victim awareness.\n \nThe Department of Education requests the authority to grant the YMCA, a not for profit organization, funding to support the Fresh Start Program.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of up to $131,450.00 from funding provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan that was passed by Congress on March 10, 2021 and signed into law on March 11, 2021.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the funding can be provided to the YMCA of Central Ohio Fresh Start Program as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Education to enter into a grant agreement with the YMCA of Central Ohio for the purpose of supporting the Fresh Start Program; to authorize the expenditure of up to $131,450.00 from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($131,450.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the YMCA of Central Ohio has been dedicated and significantly engaged with youth in Franklin County; and \n \nWHEREAS, there is more work to be done and guidance to be given as gun violence increases, academic successes wane, and youth fall victim to street and drug dealings; and\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the needs of at-risk youth; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the Fresh Start Program will address this need by serving at-risk youth ages 15-18 with social and emotional development, continued education, vocational skills / job acquisition, pro-social activity, social support, substance abuse, and victim awareness; and\n \nWHEREAS, the expenditure of American Rescue Plan funding to provide assistance for the YMCA of Central Ohio, a not for profit entity, is crucial for our economic recovery, necessary due to the COVID-19 public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with the YMCA of Central Ohio to support the Fresh Start Program, all for the preservation of public health, peace, property, and safety; and\n \nWHEREAS, such expenditure of funds has not been previously accounted for in the 2021 Budget; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
