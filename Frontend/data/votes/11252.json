    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group, for the Playground Renovations 2023 - Site Design Project. The contract amount is $334,802.03, with a contingency of $15,197.97, for a total of $350,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThis project focuses upon providing safe parks and accessible play opportunities for children throughout the City of Columbus. On a recurring basis, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department renovates playgrounds that have reached the end of their useful life and are in need of replacement. The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has over 170 playgrounds in its park system and this project will improve 12 sites, including Albany Crossing Park, Easthaven Park, Karns Park, Lazelle Woods Park, Mifflin Park, Nelson Park, Rhodes Park, Saunders Park, Schiller Park, Tuttle Park, Westgate Park, and Williams Creek Park. These funds are for site design at these twelve sites, which will incorporate the quality based designs from the four pre-qualified playground vendors.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Proposals were advertised to firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RSFQ) process, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 29, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 16, 2024. Request for proposals were received by the following companies:\nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor were they part of this evaluation.\n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group be selected to perform the work. The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline and project approach.\n \nAs part of their bid, Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group has proposed the following vendors to fulfill the Office of Diversity and Inclusion project goal:\n \nCAP-STONE & Associates, Inc.

The Department monitors the life span of play spaces routinely to make sure that safe and quality equipment is provided to the public.    \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Playground improvements have been discussed at Area Commission meetings and residents have requested playground improvements to provide more up to date equipment. These improvements allow for more physical development and socialization. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving neighborhood parks and providing playgrounds that support wellness.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $350,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group for the Playground Renovations 2023 - Site Design Project; to authorize the transfer of $350,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $350,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
