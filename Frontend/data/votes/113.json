Accordingly, DPU requested the City Attorney to acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) in order for DPU to timely complete the Public Project. The City initially passed Ordinance 3428-2018 authorizing the expenditure of $325,000.00 for the project, and DPU has now determined that an additional $500,000.00 will be needed.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: Not applicable. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes the transfer within and expenditure of up to $500,000.00 within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Fund 6109 and amends the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to align authority with the expenditure.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to acquire the Real Estate and allow DPU to timely complete the Public Project without unnecessary delay, which will preserve the public peace, health, property, safety and welfare.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to spend City funds to acquire and accept in good faith certain fee simple and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Central College Road and Harlem Road, Columbus, OH 43081, and contract for associated professional services in order for the Department of Public Utilities to timely complete the acquisition of Real Estate for the Central College Subtrunk Sewer Project; to transfer within and expend up to $500,000.00 within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund; to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; and to declare an emergency.
