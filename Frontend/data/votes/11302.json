In November of 2024, the Recreation and Parks Department received notice that the grant will be awarded. This project will acquire 6.14 acres of mature forested parcels in the North Linden Neighborhood. Data shows that these three tracts are the final part of preserving the largest remaining woodland in North Linden. The border of the property on the west will combine with two parcels, totaling 3.6 acres, that were acquired by the Recreation and Parks Department in December 2022. This new acquisition would complete protection of the entire woodland area that is a total of approximately 10 acres.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\n77 South High Street\nColumbus, Ohio  43215\nLinda Bailiff, Director, (614) 752-6829\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested in order to meet the January 27, 2024 City Council approval deadline stipulated in the purchase contract.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Preservation of high quality forest canopy, particularly in densely developed lower canopy areas of the City, provides important long term benefits to air quality.
