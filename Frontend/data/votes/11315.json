The high school encourages students to take pride in representing their school through sports; and \n \nWHEREAS, the team finished their regular season with an impressive 14-2 record, including a dominant 3-0 victory over their rivals, St. Francis DeSales High School. Their outstanding performance established a school-high in wins, while only conceding nine goals throughout the season; and \n \nWHEREAS, Bishop Watterson began their playoff run with a commanding 8-0 victory over the Licking Heights Hornets. They followed with another dominant 8-0 win against Worthington Kilbourne, then triumphed over Westerville Central 1-0, before securing a 1-0 win against Anthony Wayne in the regional final; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Eagles defeated Avon in the state semifinals, winning 1-0, earning the chance to compete in the state final for the first time after losing in semifinals in 2018 and 1998; and\n \nWHEREAS, the 2024 Bishop Watterson Eagles Girls’ Soccer Team proudly represented the City of Columbus in the Division II State Final at Historic Crew Stadium.
