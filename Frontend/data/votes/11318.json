    "description": "Title\nTo Honor, Recognize, and Celebrate the Life of James Garfield \"Chief Jackson\" Jackson and to Extend our Sincerest Condolences to his Family and Friends\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, James Garfield Jackson led the Columbus Division of Police for 19 years and was committed to maintaining the integrity and excellence of the Division during his tenure; and\n \nWHEREAS, born and raised in Columbus Ohio, Chief Jackson had a fascination with the armed forces when he was young which led him to join the Marine Corps in January 1951 after graduating high school, during a time when the Marine Corps was entrenched in racism; and\n \nWHEREAS, while in the Marine Corps, Chief Jackson witnessed prevalent racism and segregation which strengthened his resolve and prepared him for his transition into the Columbus Division of Police; and\n \nWHEREAS, when he first arrived in the Columbus Division of Police Chief Jackson overcame a culture of discrimination and was integral in the creation of the Division’s first minority recruiting section; and\n                     \nWHEREAS, his historic leadership of the minority recruiting section and commitment to diversity led to him traveling the country to help recruit minorities and women into police divisions nationwide; and \n \nWHEREAS, throughout his life Chief Jackson remained a stark advocate for change in the Columbus Division of Police and lived by the motto “do justice, love mercy, walk humbly”; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: This Council respectfully acknowledges and commemorates the life of James Garfield \"Chief Jackson\" Jackson, recognizing his meaningful contributions to the Columbus Division of Police and the City of Columbus, and this Council extends our deepest condolences to his family and friends.",
