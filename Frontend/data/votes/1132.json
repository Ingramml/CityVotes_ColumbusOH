    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Columbus City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the King Arts Complex in support of the Juneteenth 2021 Celebration.\n \nJuneteenth 2021 is a program designed for the entire community. To expand and to connect to other partner organizations, the King Arts Complex is planning three days of events that culminates with a seven-hour program on Juneteenth. There will be virtual programs to connect to the in-person programs available over the three day span. A premiere presentation of “20 & Odd” as well as the Ohio History Connection’s “Black Music the Soundtrack of Humanity” highlights the virtual programs. The focus will be on intentionality with programming and partnerships will help reach a broad audience. They anticipate reaching thousands in our community to participate in at least one Juneteenth program presented from June 17th - June 19th. \n \nJuneteenth 2021 will serve as an opportunity to educate and entertain. The focus is to have a safe family-friendly community event. The King Arts Complex plans to achieve this by having many activities and educational components that connect with the entertainment, shopping and cultural experiences that will take place during Juneteenth. It is a great opportunity to reach the community and to plant seeds of non-violence and impact early this summer. They plan to do the following:\n•                     To connect with the City of Columbus efforts to reach communities, we will offer informational tables to any City department who wants a presence at Juneteenth. \n•                     To include voter registration, criminal record expungement information and a job fair component for employers. \n•                     To feature a petting zoo, face painting, double-dutch and other youth activities for the children. Juneteenth 2021 will also have live bands, live visual artist paintings, DJ’s, information, food and merchant vendors. \n \nEmergency action is necessary to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize Columbus City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the King Arts Complex in support of the Juneteenth 2021 Celebration; to authorize appropriations and expenditures of $20,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
