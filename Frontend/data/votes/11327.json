South Side Learning and Development Center (dba SproutFive), a current tenant of the Reeb Avenue Center, ceased existence and operations at this location effective June 30, 2024.  Ordinance 1898-2024 authorized the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a First Amendment to Lease Agreement in order to grant a six-month rent reduction to the Reeb Avenue Center between August 1, 2024 and terminating on January 31, 2025.  In order to continue to assist Reeb Avenue Center, the City has agreed to a rent reduction for the remainder of the lease term terminating on August 31, 2035. During this period, rent will be adjusted to $1.00 annually.
