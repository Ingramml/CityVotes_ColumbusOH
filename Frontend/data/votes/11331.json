    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Service to reimburse various utilities and utility subcontractors for utility relocation costs incurred in conjunction with Public Service Capital Improvement projects; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND:\nIn the course of effecting roadway improvements, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements.  These relocations are in areas where the city has previously allowed utilities but due to this project there is a need to relocate them at the city's expense.  Utility relocation estimates are normally included in the budget for each project but occasionally estimates are insufficient and not always within the City's control.  This legislation provides a source of funding for unnamed utility relocations in order to provide for quick turnaround of these relocations once the utility and project are determined.\nCity Council recognizes that this ordinance does not identify the utility companies or the subcontractors of utility companies that will receive the reimbursements and understands that its passage will give the Director of Public Service the final decision in determination for such reimbursements.  This Council is satisfied it is in the best interests of the City to delegate this reimbursement decision.    \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nThis is a budgeted expense in the amount of $100,000.00 in the Department of Public Service’s 2024 Capital Improvement Budget, Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Project 530161-100070 (Roadway Improvements - Utility Relocation Reimbursements).  Funds are appropriated.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nPublic Service is requesting emergency designation so as to provide funding for utility reimbursements at the earliest possible time to maintain project construction schedules.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to reimburse various utilities and utility subcontractors for utility relocation costs incurred in conjunction with Public Service Capital Improvement projects; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is vitally concerned with the use of the various rights-of-way areas in the City as such rights-of-way represent a valuable and limited resource that must be utilized to promote the public health, safety and welfare, including the economic development of the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service requires funding to be available for utility relocation expenses for yet to be determined projects in order to provide for quick turnaround of utility relocation work; and \n \nWHEREAS, funding was budgeted for this purpose and is available for use in the Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to reimburse various utilities and utility subcontractors for utility relocation costs at the earliest possible time in order to maintain project schedules, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to pay utility relocation costs to various utilities and utility subcontractors for utility relocation costs incurred in conjunction with Public Service Capital Improvement projects.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $100,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 7704 (Streets and Highways Bonds Fund), Dept-Div 5912 (Design and Construction), Project P530161-100070 (Roadway Improvements - Utility Relocation Reimbursements), in Object Class 06 (Capital Improvements) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this Council recognizes that this ordinance does not identify the utilities, or the subcontractors of utility companies, to whom the reimbursements will be awarded and understands that its passage will give the Director of Public Service the final decision in determination for such reimbursements.  This Council is satisfied it is in the best interests of the City to delegate this reimbursement decision.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the mayor, or ten days after passage if the mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
