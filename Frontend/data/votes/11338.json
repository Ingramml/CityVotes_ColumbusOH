    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with The Ohio State University (OSU), a non-profit entity, in an amount up to $2,390.97, to create opportunities for healing with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers, and to allow for the reimbursement of expenses incurred before the purchase order date, starting August 1, 2024.\n \nPrior Ordinances relevant to this OSU-MBSR program;\n \n1435-2021     06/14/2021                     PO293529;\n \nOrdinance 1435-2021, passed by City Council on June 14, 2021, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with OSU-CoSW for the MBSR program in amount up to $27,968.00.  The agreement was executed with an agreement end date of December 31, 2022 (PO293529).  \n \n0591-2023     03/13/2023                       PO293529;\n \nBecause of issues related to COVID, the program was not implemented as planned and Council approved a second ordinance, Ord. 0591-2023, on March 13, 2023 for the not-for-profit service contract.  A contract modification to extend the agreement was not executed prior to the end of the contract term on December 31, 2024.  \n \nIn light of the tragic death of Ma'Khia Bryant in 2021, there continues to be an urgent need to provide specific, targeted support for criminal justice system-involved and at-risk Black girls. These girls are experiencing more stress due to the coronavirus and its effect on their mothers (parents/caregivers), with 57% noting that their mental health was worse due to the virus and its affects. In partnership with the Columbus City Council (CCC), Franklin County Juvenile Court (FCJC) FCJC staff will refer interested parent/caregiver-dyads to the OSU program. This intervention will help reduce stress among all participants and promote restoration and healing that will reduce the potential for law-breaking behavior.\n \nThe targeted constituents include court-involved Black girls aged 14-17 who are also disproportionality affected by PTSD, with 70% of girls with histories of sexual or physical abuse as well as their parents/caregivers. The parent/caregiver-child dyads will undergo a stress reduction intervention, i.e., Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology, which is linked to delinquency and other risky behaviors. MBSR may help modulate the dysregulated stress response in the body to improve physical and mental health concurrently. \n \nThe project is led by Dr. Camille R. Quinn, a licensed, independent social worker in Ohio and Assistant Professor at the OSU College of Social Work. Her work draws on over 20 years of prior experience in social and health services as a practitioner and administrator. She is a funded researcher and has substantive expertise to develop and tailor interventions to improve the well-being of Black youth and their families, especially girls and young women in the community and correctional settings, which are all needed to carry out this project. \n \nThese services provided by OSU cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity and expertise to provide.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to address the urgent needs facing criminal justice system-involved and at-risk Black girls and their parents and caregivers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of $2,390.97 from the Department of Development’s Neighborhood Economic Development Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006163, and expires 3/29/2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with The Ohio State University, in an amount up to $2,390.97; to create opportunities for healing with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with criminal justice system involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $2,390.97 from the Neighborhood Economic Development Fund; to allow for the reimbursement of expenses incurred before the purchase order date, starting August 1, 2024; and to declare an emergency.  ($2,390.97)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in light of the tragic death of Ma'Khia Bryant, there is an urgent need to provide specific targeted support for criminal justice system involved and at-risk girls; and\n \nWHEREAS, Franklin County Juvenile Court staff will refer interested parent/caregiver-dyads to the intervention program that will help reduce stress among all participants and promote restoration and healing that will reduce the potential for law-breaking behavior; and\n \nWHEREAS, the targeted constituents include criminal justice system involved Black girls aged 14-17 who are also disproportionality affected by PTSD, with 70% of girls with histories of sexual or physical abuse as well as their parents/caregivers; and\n \nWHEREAS, the project will be led by Dr. Camille R.
