    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:    This legislation authorizes the appropriation and transfer of $11,221,783.00 from the Debt Retirement Fund, Fund 4430 Subfund 443001 to the Debt Retirement Fund, Fund 4430 Subfund 443009.  The appropriation and transfer of $11,221,783.00 between such subfunds provides the backing, as stipulated in the City's lease agreement with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority (CFA), for certain CFA debt obligations.  The actual transfer of these funds will only occur if the CFA is unable to meet its debt obligations as outlined in its lease with the City.  The City provides fifty percent of this backing, while Franklin County is responsible for the other fifty percent.  Since 1990, no such payments have been needed, nor are any anticipated.\n \nIn connection with the issuance of the CFA’s $160,000,000 Lease Revenue Anticipation Bonds, Series 2010 (County of Franklin, Ohio, Lessee) (Federally Taxable -Build America Bonds - Direct Payment), dated February 10, 2010, the City entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the CFA and the County of Franklin, Ohio dated as of January 1, 2010, which, among other things, requires appropriation of a portion of the City’s Parking Meter Revenue, in an amount of $1,400,000.00, as consideration for certain commitments under the Cooperative Agreement and its related documents.  The payment of these funds to the CFA will only occur if the CFA is unable to meet its debt obligations as outlined in the Cooperative Agreement.\nIn 2019, the City entered into a Lease Agreement and Sub-Lease Agreement with the CFA and Franklin County, Ohio (Ordinance No. 2815-2019) in connection with the issuance of the hotel expansion bonds.  The agreement allowed the CFA to issue the 2019B Lease Appropriation bonds.  These bonds are to provide additional funding for the downtown convention center hotel expansion.  The City along with Franklin County will provide the backing for these bonds.  The City provides fifty percent of this backing, while Franklin County is responsible for the other fifty percent.  The actual transfer of these funds will only occur if the CFA is unable to meet its debt obligations.  \n \nEmergency:  This ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transactions to be posted into the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funding for the transfer and expenditure of $11,221,783.00 for 2025 has been accounted for in the Debt Retirement Fund 4430 for the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority.\n \n2024 funding was $6,982,425.00\n2023 funding was $5,707,425.00.\n2022 funding was $3,478,825.00.\n \nFunding for the expenditure of $1,400,000.00 has been accounted for in the Mobility Debt Retirement - City Parking Meter Contribution Fund 6520, Subfund 652002, for the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority.\n \nTitle\n \nTo appropriate and authorize the City Auditor to transfer $11,221,783.00 within the Debt Retirement fund;
