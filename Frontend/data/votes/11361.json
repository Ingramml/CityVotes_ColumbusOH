    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into a construction and maintenance agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, with the Columbus & Ohio River Rail Road Company (“CUOH”), a subsidiary of Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., and to encumber and expend funds to compensate the same for services rendered during the construction phase of the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening (Bexley Corp to 7th Ave) project. \nThe aforementioned effort will culminate in the full reconstruction of the portion of Cassady Avenue from a 2-lane uncurbed section to a 3-lane curb and gutter section with additional turn lanes at the intersection with East 5th Avenue. Additional improvements include installing sidewalk along the east side of the street and a shared use path along the west side; replacing the existing traffic signal; installing street lighting and street trees, where feasible; and replacing the 12” water main between Avalon Place and East 5th Avenue. \nA portion of the planned improvements either will cross or be located in close proximity to existing railroad tracks currently operated by CUOH, necessitating the execution of a construction and maintenance agreement between Public Service and CUOH to facilitate the performance of certain services by CUOH necessary to the successful completion of the project in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors. These services, which include plan review, flagging, and inspection, must be performed by CUOH in its capacity as owner/operator of the impacted tracks to comply with current regulations. To that end, this legislation seeks to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with CUOH and to compensate CUOH for said services.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,053,025.00 is available for this project in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within the Department of Public Service. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate execution of the proposed construction and maintenance agreement by the City on or before January 31, 2025, so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the project.  \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into agreements with the Columbus & Ohio River Rail Road Company, a subsidiary of Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., relative to the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening (Bexley Corp to 7th Ave) project; to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $1,053,025.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,053,025.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is administering the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening (Bexley Corp to 7th Ave) project, which will culminate in the full reconstruction of a portion of Cassady Avenue; and \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned effort requires cooperation from the Columbus & Ohio River Rail Road Company (“CUOH”), as a portion of the planned improvements either will cross or be located in close proximity to existing railroad tracks operated by CUOH; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Department of Public Service to engage CUOH, in its capacity as owner/operator of those tracks, to perform certain services necessary to the successful completion of the project, including plan review, flagging, and inspection, in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors; and \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the execution of a construction and maintenance agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, between the Department and CUOH, a subsidiary of Genessee & Wyoming, Inc., and the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $1,053,025.00, relative to the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening (Bexley Corp to 7th Ave) project; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this legislation to facilitate the execution of the proposed construction and maintenance agreement by the City on or before January 31, 2025, so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the project, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
