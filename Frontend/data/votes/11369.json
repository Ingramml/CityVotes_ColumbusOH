    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nIn 2016 and 2017, the City of Columbus commissioned a study from HR&A on the effectiveness of the City’s economic development incentives, including real property tax abatements in Community Reinvestment Areas (“CRAs”). Based on the results of the study, the City revised its policies concerning CRA abatements, and decided to encourage the development of affordable housing by conditioning the provision of CRA abatements, in certain circumstances, on the inclusion of affordable housing.\n \nIn July 2018, City Council passed Ordinance No. 2184-2018, adopting Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes to require certain entities seeking CRA abatements in Post-1994 CRAs to meet certain affordable housing requirements.\n \nPursuant to Chapter 4565, the affordable housing requirements applicable to any particular development project depends on whether the CRA in which the project will be constructed is designated as Market Ready, Ready for Revitalization, or Ready for Opportunity (the “Area Designations”). Generally speaking, the Area Designations reflect the extent to which housing within the CRA is blighted. Development projects located in areas with less blight must satisfy higher affordable housing requirements in order to receive the abatement.\n \nPursuant to Chapter 4565, the Area Designation assigned to each CRA must be reassessed every three years.\n \nThis code change will adopt certain administrative modifications to Chapter 4565.13 to provide for a an administrative process whereby the affordable housing requirements for owner-occupied housing may be waived, first through an application to the Director of the Department of Development, with a right of appeal to the CRA Housing Council pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Sections 3735.69 through 3735.70.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo repeal and replace Section 4565.13 of the Columbus City Codes to incorporate certain administrative modifications related to affordability requirements and qualifications for owner-occupied housing units utilizing the waiver provision of Chapter 4565 and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in 2016 and 2017 the City of Columbus commissioned and received a study from HR&A on the effectiveness of its economic development incentives, including real property tax abatements in Community Reinvestment Areas; and\n \nWHEREAS, in response to the study, the City developed a revised incentive policy to encourage the development of affordable housing in CRAs in stronger market areas within the City by requiring developers to construct affordable housing in consideration of the City granting the developer a tax abatement; and\n \nWHEREAS, in July 2018, City Council passed Ordinance No. 2184-2018, amending Title 45 of the Columbus City Codes to add Chapter 4565 embodying the City’s new residential CRA incentive policy for Post-1994 CRAs; and\n \nWHEREAS, Chapter 4565 empowers the Director of the Department of Development to assign each residential CRA within the City one of three housing Area Designations: Market Ready, Ready for Revitalization, or Ready for Opportunity; and\n \nWHEREAS, in accordance with the foregoing, Chapter 4565 requires certain property owners in Market Ready, Ready for Revitalization, and Ready for Opportunity areas to satisfy certain affordable housing requirements to receive a CRA abatement; and\n \nWHEREAS, Chapter 4565 requires the Director to reassess the Area Designations assigned to each post-1994 CRA every three years to evaluate current market conditions based on the criteria outlined in Chapter 4565; and\n \nWHEREAS, Chapter 4565 was updated in 2022 and 2023 with the passage of Ordinance No. 1843-2022 and Ordinance No. 1839-2023, respectively; and\n \nWHEREAS, in December 2023, City Council adopted additional administrative amendments to Chapter 4565 with the passage of Ordinance No. 3447-2023, as amended by Ordinance No. 1392-2024, to include a provision in Section 4565.13 of the Columbus City Codes to permit waiver of the affordable housing requirements for owner-occupied housing under certain conditions; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to repeal and replace Section 4565.13 in order to make certain administrative modifications related to affordability requirements and qualifications for owner occupied housing units utilizing the waiver provision of Chapter 4565; NOW, THEREFORE and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation in the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to pass this ordinance so that the Department can begin to utilize the process right away to consider affordable housing development projects for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
