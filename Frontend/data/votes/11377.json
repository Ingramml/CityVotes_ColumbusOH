    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize Cardiovascular Disease as the World’s Leading Cause of Death and to Support the Recognition of Friday, February 7, 2025 as “National Wear Red Day” and February as “American Heart Month”\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S., and is the leading cause of death in women, claiming more lives than all forms of cancer combined and yet only 44% of women recognize that cardiovascular disease in their greatest health threat; and\n \nWHEREAS, among females 20 years and older, nearly 45% are living with some form of cardiovascular disease and less than half of women entering pregnancy in the United States have optimal cardiovascular; and\nWHEREAS, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of maternal death in the U.S., or more simply put, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of new moms, additionally, in 2020, stroke caused the deaths of 90,627 females, approximately 56.5% of total stroke deaths; and\nWHEREAS, women are often less likely to receive bystander CPR because rescuers often fear accusations of inappropriate touching, sexual assault or injuring the victim; and\nWHEREAS, there are significant biological differences between men and women, and as of 2020, only 38% of cardiovascular clinical research trial participants are women, but most cardiac and stroke events can be prevented through education and lifestyle changes, such as moving more, eating smart and managing blood pressure; and\nWHEREAS, since 2004, the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women movement has addressed the awareness and clinical care gaps of women’s greatest health threat, cardiovascular disease, and continues to make bold moves to save lives and pioneer scientific discoveries; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize the importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease and stroke, does hereby proclaim Friday, February 7, 2025, to be NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY and the month of February to be American Heart Month in Columbus, Ohio and urge all residents to show their support for women and the fight against heart disease by commemorating this day by wearing the color red.",
