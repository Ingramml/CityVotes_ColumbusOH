    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nOn June 15, 2018, a request for statement of qualifications (RFSQ) RFQ009481 was issued on behalf of the City Treasurer’s Office for investment advisory services. The City’s objectives in retaining an investment advisor are to improve its investment capabilities and operational efficiency by maximizing incremental income, and obtaining operational information flow on its portfolio.  RFQ009481 was advertised and statements of qualifications were opened on July 10, 2018.  Fifteen (15) responses were received.  An evaluation committee consisting of one representative each from the Department of Finance and Management, the City Auditor’s Office and the City Treasurer’s Office met on July 20, 2018, and submitted preliminary scores.  On July 20, 2018, three firms (FTN Financial Main Street Advisors, Meeder Public Funds and PFM Asset Management) were selected by the RFP Committee to provide technical proposals including cost structures, and in-person presentations. The RFP was distributed on July 27, 2018, and proposals were due on August 17, 2018. The finalists presented in-person during three presentations August 23 and 24, 2018. The committee met and submitted their scoring for the technical proposals on August 28, 2018.\n \nAfter viewing presentations and evaluating the technical proposals, in compliance with Columbus City Code 329.27, the committee recommended that the Treasury Investment Board authorize the City Treasurer to enter into negotiations with Meeder Public Funds, subject to successful resolution of the discussion items brought forth by the committee.\n \nThe contract with Meeder Public Funds is for the period of October 15, 2018, through March 31, 2021, with three one-year options for renewal subject to annual appropriations and approval of contracts by the Columbus City Council.  \n \nThe City Treasurer’s Office renewed its contract with Meeder Public Funds to exercise its final option to extend its contract term from April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, with passage of Ordinance 0300-2023 on February 6, 2023.\n \nIn a normal year, the City Treasurer would be engaged in a new RFP process to procure investment advisory services.  However, the Treasurer’s Office, with participation from the City Auditor’s Office and the Administration, concluded a two-year RFP project for banking services for which new contracts began September 1, 2023.  The project required a complex implementation estimated to take between 12 and 18 months to accomplish. The Treasurer sought a discussion with the members of the Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board to gather consensus as to what action should be taken.  It was recommended that the Treasurer should explore the possibility of a three-year contract extension with Meeder.\n \nThe Treasurer engaged with Meeder Public Funds and it was determined that Meeder would do so.  Columbus City Council authorized a one-year extension of the Treasurer’s Office contract with Meeder Public Funds from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, with the addition of two one-year options for renewal, with passage of Ordinance 2293-2023 on September 18, 2023.  Columbus City Council authorized funding of $228,000.00 for the first extension with passage of ordinance 0482-2024 on March 4, 2024.\n \nThe City Treasurer now requests authorization to renew the contract for the second extension for the period April 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026, and to add funding of $240,000.00.  The cost of the extension was negotiated by the Treasurer and Meeder Public Funds.  \n \nContract Compliance:  Meeder Public Funds 34-1700641, expiration 4/19/2026.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds for this contract are contingent on passage of the 2025 budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to renew its contract for investment advisory services with Meeder Public Funds, Inc., for the period from April 1, 2025, to March 31, 2026; and to authorize the expenditure of $240,000.00 from the General Fund.
