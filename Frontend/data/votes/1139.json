    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Image Character Etiquette Inc., in an amount up to $77,716.00, for its Eryn PiNK “She’s Gold Leadership Program”. \n \nFounded in 2011, Eryn PiNK (Image Character Etiquette Inc.)  is a Columbus-based non-profit organization dedicated to the empowerment of girls and teens, with a targeted emphasis on creating pathways of advancement for girls and young women of color to thrive.  Their innovative programs provide girls with consistent access to mentorship and tangible resources needed to become leaders in their communities and beyond. \n---Led by a dedicated team of mentors and “role models,” their curriculum implements customized solutions and strategies for young girls and women to boldly speak up and advocate for equitable realities for themselves, their families, and communities. They inspire girls to set standards and expectations that align with their values and morals, to encourage confidence so that they can confront stereotypes and peer pressure, and to empower them to find and use their voices. \nLed by this mission, Eryn PiNK creates “brave spaces” for girls to discover the meaning of purpose, leadership, process their emotions in healthy ways and connect with like-minded peers and mentors who look like them. The concept of Eryn PiNK is based on a fictional, 12-year-old African American girl who illustrates what it means to be an empowered leader and role model navigating society today. Her real-life experiences underscore the needs addressed by the organization.\nIn a survey completed by Eryn PiNK program participants, girls shared they were perceived as loud, mean, bossy, and “too black,” and, subsequently, not ideal candidates for access to leadership opportunities at their respective schools. The consequences of these stereotypes, particularly when not immediately countered by positive reinforcements of their value and greatness, shape the educational, professional, and social experiences of Black girls, resulting in systemic challenges that follow them throughout their lives. \nBlack girls are taught to constrain their behaviors, hold their tongues, and to be quiet, passive followers that do not offend others. This silencing, impacts their self-esteem, health, finances, familial, and peer interactions. 73 percent of Black girls in Central Ohio reported to the Commission on Black Girls that they desired leadership opportunities. \nAs a direct response to this and the feedback of the girls, the Eryn PiNK “She’s Gold Leadership Program” is a training and project-based cohort for middle school age girls. This program offers leadership opportunities where students are equipped and given opportunities to lead and amplify their voices. In addition, the program addresses and provides resources to girls to support mental health concerns, isolation and anxiety caused by COVID-19. \n \nThese services provided by Image Character Etiquette Inc. cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure program services can begin without delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 035933 and expires on 06/03/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Image Character Etiquette Inc., in an amount up to $77,716.00. for its Eryn PiNK \"She’s Gold Leadership Program\"; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $77,716.00 from the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
