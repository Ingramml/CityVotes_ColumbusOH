    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to record the Notice of Funding with the Franklin County Recorder, as required by the NatureWorks 2023 Procedural Reporting Guide.\n \nIn June of 2020, the Recreation and Parks Department applied for grant funding through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) NatureWorks Program, as authorized by Ordinance 0804-2020, to support the Linview Park Project. In December of 2021, the Department received notice that the grant was approved. Legislation was submitted in April 2022 to enter into a grant agreement with ODNR, as authorized by Ordinance 1081-2022. Finalized construction plans were received in 2023 and the project was bid for construction in August 2023. The Recreation and Parks Department entered into contract with Builderscape, Inc. for the construction of the project, as authorized by Ordinance 2464-2023. This construction project was completed in November of 2024. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department was recently advised by an ODNR representative that the Notice of Funding must be recorded with the Franklin County Recorder, as required by the NatureWorks 2023 Procedural Reporting Guide. This is needed in order to successfully receive grant reimbursement for the project and close out the grant. \n \nPrincipal Parties:\nOhio Department of Natural Resources \n2045 Morse Road\nColumbus, Ohio 43229\nTimothy Robinson, (614) 265-6528\nContract Compliance Number: 005089\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to comply with ODNR's NatureWorks grant reporting requirements which will allow the Recreation and Parks Department to receive the grant reimbursement, complete final grant reporting, and to remain in good standing with ODNR as they have offered a grace period beyond the December 31, 2024 deadline of the grant agreement. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The near Northeast area of Columbus lacks adequate open spaces and parks. This park furthers the city’s goal of providing recreational areas and outdoor experiences for inner city neighborhoods. Over 6,000 residents live within a 10 minute walk of this project.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Initial public engagement meetings took place throughout 2019 to survey residents and get input for features to be included in the park design.  Additional public meetings took place in February of 2022 to inform final design and desired park amenities.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Northeast (41)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing equitable and safe access to parks for underserved communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to record the Notice of Funding with the Franklin County Recorder, as required by the NatureWorks 2023 Procedural Reporting Guide; and to declare an emergency. ($0)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to record the Notice of Funding with the Franklin County Recorder, as required by the NatureWorks 2023 Procedural Reporting Guide; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to record the Notice of Funding with the Franklin County Recorder, as required by the NatureWorks 2023 Procedural Reporting Guide, to comply with ODNR's NatureWorks grant reporting requirements which will allow the Recreation and Parks Department to receive the grant reimbursement, complete final  grant reporting, and to remain in good standing with ODNR as they have offered a grace period beyond the December 31, 2024 deadline of the grant agreement, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare and, NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Recreation and Parks be and is hereby authorized to record the Notice of Funding with the Franklin County Recorder, as required by the NatureWorks 2023 Procedural Reporting Guide, for the Linview Park Project. \n \nSECTION 2.
