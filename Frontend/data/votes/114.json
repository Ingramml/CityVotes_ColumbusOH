These costs include maintenance and license renewals, phone and data charges, staff augmentation, etc.  The funds are deposited into a special subfund, created expressly to account for the project’s revenues and expenditures. Periodic appropriations from the unappropriated balance of this subfund are sought as needed and as funds are received by the city.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes  the  Director  of  Finance  and  Management,  on  behalf  of  the  Department  of Technology, to associate  all  General  Budget  Reservations  resulting  from  this  ordinance  with  pre-established Universal  Term  Contract  (UTC)/Purchase  Agreements   (PA)   PO000901 with   AT&T   for   data services.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:\nAT&T: CC#-340436390, expires 1-7-21; DAX #-006413\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThere is  currently  an  unencumbered  cash  balance  of  $ 325,402.83  in  the  Information  Services  Operating Fund, Columbus  City  Schools  Telephone  Services  subfund.
