    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with The Ohio State University (OSU), in an amount up to $27,968.00, to create opportunities for healing with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers. \n \nIn light of the tragic death of Ma'Khia Bryant several weeks ago, there is an urgent need to provide specific, targeted support for criminal justice system-involved and at-risk Black girls. These girls are experiencing more stress due to the coronavirus and its effect on their mothers (parents/caregivers), with 57% noting that their mental health was worse due to the virus and its affects. In partnership with the Columbus City Council (CCC), Franklin County Juvenile Court (FCJC) FCJC staff will refer interested parent/caregiver-dyads to the OSU program. This intervention will help reduce stress among all participants and promote restoration and healing that will reduce the potential for law-breaking behavior.\n \nThe targeted constituents include court-involved Black girls aged 14-17 who are also disproportionality affected by PTSD, with 70% of girls with histories of sexual or physical abuse as well as their parents/caregivers. The parent/caregiver-child dyads will undergo a stress reduction intervention, i.e., Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology, which is linked to delinquency and other risky behaviors. MBSR may help modulate the dysregulated stress response in the body to improve physical and mental health concurrently. \n \nThe project will be led by Dr. Camille R. Quinn, a licensed, independent social worker in Ohio and Assistant Professor at the OSU College of Social Work. Her work draws on over 20 years of prior experience in social and health services as a practitioner and administrator. She is a funded researcher and has substantive expertise to develop and tailor interventions to improve the well-being of Black youth and their families, especially girls and young women in the community and correctional settings, which are all needed to carry out this project. \n \nThese services provided by OSU cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity and expertise to provide.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to address the urgent needs facing criminal justice system-involved and at-risk girls.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006163. Contract compliance is pending.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with The Ohio State University, in an amount up to $27,968.00, to create opportunities for healing with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with criminal justice system involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $27,968.00 from the General Fund Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
