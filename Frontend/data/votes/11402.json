    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the professional engineering services contracts with Burgess & Niple, Inc. (Contract No. 2227) for the General Engineering Services - Water Supply Group GES 2021A contract, CIP # 690446-100007, and Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. (Contract No. 2228) for General Engineering Services - Water Supply Group 2021B, CIP #690446-100008, for the Division of Water’s Supply Group, each in the amount of $450,000.00, for a total amount of $900,000.00.\n \nAn RFP process established two task order based professional services contracts to augment existing engineering personnel within the Division of Water on an as-authorized, as-needed basis in order to accomplish a wide range of work that may include but is not limited to planning/ design/construction phase engineering services, surveying, property acquisition assistance, hazardous waste identification/remediation, materials testing, and other services required by the Division.  One contract was established with Burgess & Niple Inc., and one contract was established with Hatch Associates Consultant, Inc.   \n \nThis ordinance will authorize a contract modification in the amount of $450,000.00 for each agreement for the estimated engineering needs within the Division of Water starting the first quarter of 2025 for approximately one year or until all tasks assigned under the contracts during that one-year time are completed to the satisfaction of the City.  \n \nPlanning area = “99-Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $900,000.00\n2021A Original Contract (PO350818, Ord. 2273-2022)                                           $400,000\n2021B Original Contract (PO351858, Ord. 2273-2022)                                           $400,000\n \n2021A Contract Modification #1 (PO446072, Ord. 0396-2024)                                           $400,000\n2021B Contract Modification #1 (PO439856, Ord. 0396-2024)                                          $400,000\n \n2021A Contract Modification #2 (Ord. 0082-2025)                                          $450,000\n2021B Contract Modification #2 (Ord. 0082-2025)                                          $450,000\nANTICIPATED CONTRACT TOTAL (combined)                                         $2,500,000\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used \nThese contracts were awarded per the City’s RFP process and approved via Ordinance 2273-2022, with planned modifications to extend the contracts and add funding.  Another procurement process is not required to do this.\n \n1.3. How cost of the modification was determined\nThe cost of the modification was determined by the estimated needs of the Division of Water over the next year, using titles, rates, and allowable expenses from the existing contracts.  \n \n1.4 Timeline and future modifications\nThe modifications are anticipated to be executed in the first quarter of 2025 to provide funds for approximately one year or until all tasks assigned under the contracts during that one-year time are completed to the satisfaction of the City.  The Division of Water anticipates executing one future modification to each contract, which will extend the term of each agreement for one year or until all tasks assigned under the contracts during that one year time are completed to the satisfaction of the City.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThese modifications will provide general engineering services for various tasks which may involve the water treatment process, the equipment, the facilities and/or the resources managed by the Water Supply Group. The tasks performed will assist the Division of Water to provide an adequate and safe supply of drinking water which is essential to economic growth and development.\n \nOne requirement for the consultant awarded the General Engineering Services contract for the Division of Water is that the consultant must be able to provide environmental engineering services, if needed.  Also, the consultant selected has indicated a corporate philosophy of environmental conservation and sustainable business practices.  In addition, the selected team has committed to incorporate sustainability considerations into their projects.\n \nAt this time no community outreach or input is anticipated.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nBurgess & Niple, Inc.’s contract compliance is CC004425 and expires on 1/10/26.  Hatch Associates Consultant, Inc.’s contract compliance is CC025646 and expires on 7/1/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThese contracts were put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and are not subject to the requirements of that program.  The two lead consultants, Burgess & Niple, Inc., and Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc., are both classified as majority companies by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Both prime consultants plan to use diverse companies for the work.  The MBE percentage for these contract modifications is unknown at this time due to the contracts being task order contracts and the tasks have not been defined.  \n \nThe subconsultants Burgess & Niple, Inc. proposes to use for this contract modification are listed below:\nContractor Name                                      City/State                               ODI Certification Status\nCDM Smith                                                                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                         MAJ\nDynotec                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                MBE\nMA Design                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                        WBE\n \nThe certification of Burgess & Niple, Inc. and all subcontractors was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \nThe subconsultants Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. proposes to use for this contract modification are listed below:\nContractor Name                                      City/State                               ODI Certification Status\nJacobs                                                                                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                        MAJ\nDLZ                                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                               MBE\nResource International                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                        WBE\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                        MBE\nRegency                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                        WBE\n \nThe certification of Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. and all subcontractors was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT  \nFunds in the amount of $900,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within Fund 6006 (Water Bond Fund) is also needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into contract modifications for the General Engineering Services - Water Supply Group GES 2021A and 2021B contracts with Burgess & Niple, Inc. and Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. to add funds for continued services;  to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget;
