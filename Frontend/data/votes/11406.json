    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Department of Public Utilities recommends refunding fees to Carlyles Watch Condominium Association, 100 E Gay St, Columbus OH 43215-3109 (Account# 533609-1281042) for overpayment of water and sewer charges. A Large-Meter Technician was sent out to the property to test the meter for a high bill concern generated by a call from the customer. The meter was operating as it should. The technician went back out to the property on 11/20/24 and discovered that the meter was set to report cubic feet and the output line that hooks to the exterior communication device was set to report in gallons. Technician corrected the output line.\n \nCustomer Service created a bill simulation for the time period 11/14/23-11/20/24 and adjusted the bill accordingly, by reducing the water charges by $53,532.60 & sewer charges by $81,392.35. Through no fault of the customer, the configuration of the meter’s endpoint was incorrect resulting in over billing the customer from 11/14/23 - 11/20/24. After recent billings, the customer now has a credit balance of $83,595.41 and has requested a refund. \n \nContract Compliance is not required as this refund is necessary to our customer to whom we have agreed to provide water services.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: This ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to provide for the prompt refund of these fees to our customer.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There is no budgetary impact because we are returning a portion of funds the customer paid. Revenues are not significantly impacted by this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to refund Carlyles Watch Condominium Association for overpayment of water and sewer charges; and to authorize a revenue reduction transaction of $83,595.41 for water and sewer charges, and to declare an emergency. ($83,595.41)  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities recommends refunding fees to Carlyles Watch Condominium Association, 100 E Gay St, Columbus OH 43215-3109, account 533609-1281042 for overpayment of water and sewer charges, and\n \nWHEREAS, the adjustment was made after the technician discovered that the meter was set to report cubic feet and the output line that hooks to the exterior communication device was set to report in gallons. Through no fault of the customer, the configuration of the meter’s endpoint was incorrect resulting in over billing the customer from 11/14/23 - 11/30/24, and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to refund Carlyles Watch Condominium Association, 100 E Gay St, Columbus OH 43215-3109 (533609-1281042), for the preservation of public health, peace, property and safety; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities be and is hereby authorized to refund fees to Carlyles Watch Condominium Association, 100 E Gay St, Columbus OH 43215-3109, account 533609-1281042 in the amount of $83,595.41.\n \nSECTION 2.  That a revenue reduction transaction for water and sewer charges in the total amount of $83,595.41 or as much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Division 6001, Water-Fund 6000, Sanitary-Fund 6100, Stormwater-Fund 6200 and Power- Fund 6300 Operating Funds.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
