    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify (Modification No. 1) a contract with Walter Watts to add funding in an amount up to $2,744.25.\n \nOriginal Contract Amount                                                                $35,000.00                      PO441969\nModification                                                                                                           $2,744.25\nTotal Contractor Amount                                                               $37,744.25\n \nThe Graffiti Assistance Program helps the owners of residentially and commercially zoned property to comply with the law by offering a no-cost graffiti removal service. The program removes graffiti from surfaces of various structures on occupied property including, but not limited to: private residential and commercial structures, fences, and garages, where the owner has provided prior authorization to enter and remove the graffiti.                     \n \nIn 2024, a Request for Quotations (RFQ026991) was published, and Walter Watts was awarded PO441969 as the only bidder. The Director of Building and Zoning Services entered into contract with Walter Watts under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19. The contract period is from May 1, 2024 to April 30, 2025.\n \nDue to an internal clerical error, the department’s program manager assigned work to Walter Watts in excess of available contract funding. Walter Watts completed the assigned work order. The department incurred these additional costs according to the agreed-upon price schedule of the original contract.\n \nModifying the agreement to add funds will allow the Department of Building and Zoning Services to compensate Walter Watts for services already rendered.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract modification is budgeted in the 2025 Building and Zoning Services general fund budget. This ordinance is contingent on the passage of 2025 General Fund Budget, Ordinance 3035-2024.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor’s contract compliance number, 041229, expires on 8/15/2026.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify a contract with Walter Watts to increase funding; and to authorize an expenditure from the General Fund. ($2,744.25)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is the responsibility of the Graffiti Assistance Program to abate graffiti on eligible residential and commercial properties, which helps owners comply with city code by offering a no-cost graffiti removal service; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Building and Zoning Services has identified the need to modify a contract (PO441969) with Walter Watts in an amount up to $2,744.25 for services provided to the Graffiti Assistance Program in excess of the originally contracted amount; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification will provide the funding to allow the Department of Building and Zoning Services to reimburse Walter Watts for services already rendered; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds for this contract modification are budgeted in the 2025 Building and Zoning Services general fund budget, which is contingent on the passage of Ordinance 3035-2024; Now, Therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                      That the Director of Building and Zoning Services be and is authorized to modify the contract with Walter Watts by adding funds in an amount up to $2,744.25 for services already provided to the Graffiti Assistance Program.\n \nSECTION 2.                      That the expenditure of $2,744.25, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 4302 (Code Enforcement), Object Class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. (See attachment Ord. 0113-2025 attachment)\n \nSECTION 3.  That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Code Chapter 329 relating to contract modifications.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n                     \nSECTION 5.                      That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
