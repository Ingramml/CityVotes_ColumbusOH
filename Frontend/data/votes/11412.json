    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $61,529.00 and expenditure up to $61,529.00 of grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the HOME investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Feasibility Research Group Ohio, LLC in an amount up to $61,529.00 00 to produce a Housing Market Analysis Services report for the area of corporate Columbus, the Columbus MSA counties of Franklin, Delaware, Licking, Fairfield, Union and additional counties served by the Housing Opportunity for Persons with Aids program, which are Morrow and Pickaway counties.  \nThe City of Columbus (City) is the capital and largest city in the state of Ohio. It is the 14th largest city in the United States with a population of 905,748 as of 2020.  It is the core city of the Columbus, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which encompasses a ten-county region.\nThe City of Columbus is one of the fastest growing cities in the nation boasting affordable living, job opportunities and strategic economic geographical placement in the Midwest. With growth comes the need for affordable housing. Housing programs will have to be competitive in the rental market in order to provide affordable housing to the citizens of Columbus within the private market. As the City continues to work through the process of updating the zoning code to assist with the development of more affordable housing, it is clear that market rates for rent will be affected.  The Housing Market Analysis Report will be used to provide Housing and Urban Development supporting documentation of the city’s request for a community-wide rent standard exception.\nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ027480 through the Vendor Services portal on June 24, 2024, and accepted proposals for Housing Market Analysis Services through the Bonfire portal on July 22, 2024.  Six (6) proposals were submitted in response to RFQ027480 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  Feasibility Research Group Ohio, LLC was selected by an evaluation committee of staff from the Department of Development.  The qualifications were based on federal experience and availability, references, and other factors.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is needed to avoid any delay in analyzing the housing market and developing a report, which will help provide the necessary services for the City’s most vulnerable populations.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $61,529.00 is available within the 2020 HOME grant (G451903).  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s contract compliance 022168 expires 11/15/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a service contract with Feasibility Research Group Ohio, LLC in an amount up to $61,529.00 to produce a Housing Market Analysis Services report; to authorize the appropriation of $61,529.00; to authorize the expenditure of $61,529.00; and to declare an emergency.
