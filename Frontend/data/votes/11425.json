That this legislation does not authorize any expenditures; financial commitments of the City will be subject to future appropriations by Columbus City Council.\n \nSECTION 3.  That City Council hereby finds it in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 4. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is made a part hereof, this Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten (10) days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes this same.",
