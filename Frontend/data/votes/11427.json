    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with Vaisala Inc. for the purchase of Mobile Road Weather Information Sensors for the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management.  This ordinance also authorizes the appropriation of grant funds and expending of grant funds within the Federal Transportation Grants Fund, Fund 7765 and city funds within the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund, Fund 2266, contingent on the passage of Ordinance 0055-2025 for this purchase.  The Division of Infrastructure Management will use Mobile Road Weather Information Sensors on snow and ice equipment to monitor weather and to aid in decision making during snow and ice events. These sensors take different types of readings, including the level of friction and grip in real time during snow and ice events. This provides critical data to allow better decisions on salt and material usage, plowing effectiveness, roadway safety, and speed recovery.  This information can be used to save time and material costs, redirecting resources to where they are needed most.\n \nOrdinance 2007-2024 authorized the Director of Public Service to formally apply for funding from ODOT for the FHWA STIC Incentive program grant funds and, if awarded, to accept the award on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to execute those documents necessary to accept the grant, to administer the grant funds, and to refund any unused funds to ODOT after the grant period ends if final accounting determines a refund is owed.  The grant funding from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is related to the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) State Transportation Innovation Council (STIC) Incentive grant program for the Department of Public Service. Through this program, grant funding up to $100,000 per State per Federal fiscal year is made available to support or offset the costs of standardizing innovative practices in a State transportation agency (STA) or other public sector STIC stakeholder. The program is administered by FHWA’s Center for Accelerating Innovation (CAI).  The Department of Public Service was awarded up to $100,000 of said grant monies to fund the purchase of Mobile Road Weather Information Sensors and the grant agreement has been fully executed.  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Vaisala Inc.\n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nThe contract compliance number for Vaisala Inc. is CC 048643 and expires on 03/28/2026.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nA grant from the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) State Transportation Innovation Council (STIC) Incentive grant program administered by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) in Federal Transportation Grants Fund, Fund 7765, G592502, will partially fund the purchase of this equipment.  Public Service is required to contribute a minimum 20% local share in the amount of $25,000.00 from the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund, Fund 2266, contingent on the passage of Ordinance 0055-2025.\n4.  REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF FORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS\nA request for waiver of the formal competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is requested for this purchase so that the Division of Infrastructure Management can purchase the equipment during the current winter season as required by the grant agreement. This falls under the simplified acquisition threshold noted as an exception under CFR 200.320(c) and is detailed in the bid waiver.\n \n5.
