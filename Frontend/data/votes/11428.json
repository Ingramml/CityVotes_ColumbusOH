On August 13, 2024, RFP026722 was cancelled. The results of this RFP were to be used to determine if Human Resources needed to have a separate cancer advocacy services vendor. As this RFP was canceled, the Human Resources Department did not have time to complete an additional RFP process in 2024. Therefore, the Human Resources Department requests a waiver of competitive bidding requirements. The Human Resources Department will comply with the competitive bidding provisions in Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code in 2025.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funds in the amount of $104,000.00 are currently available and in the Employee Benefits Fund and specifically budgeted for this purpose.    \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Human Resources to enter into contract with CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge for cancer advocacy services for the term March 1, 2025 through February 28, 2026; to authorize an appropriation of $104,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Employee Benefits Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to authorize the expenditure of $104,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the cost of said contract; ($104,000.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, an appropriation is needed to cover costs associated with the CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge, contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, funds for this appropriation are currently available in the Employee Benefits Fund 5502, and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $104,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay contract costs for cancer advocacy services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to contract with CancerLink LLC dba CancerBridge to provide all eligible employees from March 1, 2025 through February 28, 2026; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1:  That the Director of the Department of Human Resources is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with CancerLink LLC dba CancerBridge to provide cancer advocacy services to all eligible employees from March 1, 2025 through February 28, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.
