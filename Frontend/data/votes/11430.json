($150,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to purchase a van and all necessary accessories to be used by Columbus Public Health’s Lead Program, utilizing existing grant funds budgeted within the 2023 ODH Lead Safe Housing Grant, in an amount not to exceed $150,000.00. \n \nColumbus Public Health will strategically use this mobile unit to provide blood lead screenings for children under age six and provide general lead poisoning prevention outreach to our residents. The mobile unit will allow us to provide these services in high-risk zip codes and areas of Columbus where families have access to care issues. \n \nA waiver of the competitive bid process as outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329.15 is requested because the minimum lead-time to up fit a van to our specifications is 16 weeks from receipt of the vehicle, according to vendor estimates. The Grantor (Ohio Department of Health) did not authorize the purchase of a vehicle until November 26, 2024. If purchased as soon as possible, the van would arrive to the vendor in February or March of 2025 at the earliest. This timeframe would surpass the remaining life of the grant if a formal bid were to be included, as all expenses must be encumbered and expensed prior to the end of the grant period on June 30, 2025. \n  \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders with Waldoch Crafts Inc to purchase a van and perform all up-fitting services as directed by Columbus Public Health’s Lead Program. \n \nThe contract compliance number for Waldoch Crafts Inc is CC-051259.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain and to ensure all purchases are completed within the grant period. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicle order windows to open and close, at random, with little to no notice. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that orders can be placed as soon as possible.\nFiscal Impact: Expenditures for these authorized purchases are budgeted in the General Government Grants Fund, Fund No. 2220. ($150,000.00)\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to purchase a van and all necessary accessories to be used by Columbus Public Health’s Lead Program; to waive the competitive bid process as outlined in Columbus City Code; to authorize an expenditure from the General Government Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency. ($150,000.00)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to purchase a van and all necessary accessories to be used by Columbus Public Health’s Lead Program to provide blood lead screenings throughout our community; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders with Waldoch Crafts Inc for a van and all necessary accessories on behalf of the Board of Health, utilizing a waiver of the competitive bid process as outlined in the attached waiver form; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding for these expenditures is established in this ordinance and budgeted in the 2023 ODH Lead Safe Housing Grant within the General Government Grants Fund, Fund No. 2220; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Board of Health and the Department of Finance & Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to establish various purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of a new van and associated up-fitting for use by Columbus Public Health’s Lead Program so that orders can be placed as soon as possible prior to the expiration of the Ohio Department of Health grant, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division and Board of Health, is hereby authorized to establish purchase orders with Waldoch Crafts Inc to purchase a van and perform all up-fitting services as directed by Columbus Public Health’s Lead Program. \n \nSECTION 2.                      That the competitive bidding provisions in Chapter 329.18 of the Columbus City Code are hereby waived for reasons listed in the attached waiver form. \n  \nSECTION 3.                     That the expenditure of $150,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized and approved from the General Government Grants Fund, Fund No. 2220, Department 50, Division 5001, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That the monies in the foregoing Sections shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner and/or the Director of Finance and Management, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 5.                     That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.                     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n  \nSECTION 7.                     That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
