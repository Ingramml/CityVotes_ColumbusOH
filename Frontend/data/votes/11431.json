($3,622,766.34) (Amended by Ord. 1022-2025 passed on 4/21/2025 -LG)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into and, if needed, modify contracts with the following vendors to provide HIV-related somatic and outpatient/ambulatory medical care, early intervention services, medical and non-medical case management services, medical transportation, mental health services, housing services, emergency financial assistance, and any other service allowable under the grant. The term of the contract with each qualified vendor is March 1, 2025, through February 28, 2026, with funding based on vendor estimates of annual funding requirements for allowable services. These services were advertised through vendor services with RFQ023101 on October 10, 2022, according to bidding requirements of the City Code. This RFQ covers a 60-month grant period, March 1, 2023 to February 28, 2028. Annual contracts will be issued. \n \nThe City of Columbus, Columbus Public Health, receives funding for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The purpose of this grant is to improve access to quality medical care for persons with HIV or AIDS living in Central Ohio (Franklin, Licking, Delaware, Morrow, Union, Madison, Pickaway, and Fairfield counties). The goal is that each client will achieve viral suppression, which improves their quality of life and reduces the risk of spreading the infection.  \n \nAIDS Healthcare Foundation CC-010938 $566,707.00\nEquitas Health CC-004721 $1,282,103.71\nHeart of Ohio Family Health Centers CC-007697 $239,103.09\nThe Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital CC-006172 $720,404.54\nThe Ohio State University Physicians Inc. CC-005200 $814,448.00\n \nTOTAL INITIAL CONTRACTS IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED:  $3,622,766.34\n \nUnder the terms of the grant, funds must be used during the grant period or they are forfeited and CPH may be subject to penalties related to future grant funding.  Previously, CPH has reallocated unused funds from vendors through appropriate contract modifications. These modifications oftentimes required additional legislation. Most recently, toward the goals of minimizing unused funds, maximizing available services, and avoiding funding penalties, HRSA has tasked CPH with improving the process by which unused funds are reallocated. Therefore, this ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with qualified vendors, modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused and reallocate unused funds amongst the initial vendors without the need for additional legislation.  If there is a need to enter into contracts with additional vendors, the requirements of City Code procurement will be followed. As such, this ordinance requests a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329, as well as the contract modification procedures of Chapter 329. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that quality medical care continues to be available to eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS and to ensure timely payment to providers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nContracts will be entered into by Columbus Public Health with vendors who meet federal requirements related to services allowable under the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program as well as comply with the RFQ and City bidding processes. Based on the funding projection letter, this ordinance will authorize an initial ACPO in the amount of $3,622,766.34 to encumber funds using available grant appropriations for contracts with vendors.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with the following qualified vendors: AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Equitas Health, Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and The Ohio State University Physicians Inc.; to authorize the Board of Health to modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds amongst the initial vendors without the need for additional legislation for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio; to authorize the expenditure up to $3,622,766.34 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; to waive applicable provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
