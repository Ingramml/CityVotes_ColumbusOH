    "description": "...Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management (PCM) 2023 project, CIP #690587-100002, in an amount not to exceed $4,147,800.00.  \n \nThis contract will assist the City with managing a capital improvement program consisting of multiple capital improvement projects to ensure completion in accordance with design requirements and City’s needs, while serving as a liaison between the construction contractor, design professional (DP), and City personnel.  Work performed to date under the initial contract funding includes program management services, design phase construction management services, and construction administration / construction inspection services for multiple capital improvement projects.  Future phases will include modifications of the contract until the last assigned construction contract is completed. \n \nThe Community Area “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1.  UPDATED TIMELINE & FUTURE RENEWALS\nThe Notice to Proceed (NTP) for the original contract (Ordinance No. 2329-2023, PO416847) occurred in November 2023.  Construction projects will be assigned to this contract based on their advertisement date using a three-year assignment period that started at this contract’s NTP date (November 2023) and runs to December 2026.  Funds will be authorized through annual contract modifications (or more frequent modifications if required by fiscal needs). The PCM team will provide construction services through completion of the last construction project assigned to this contract.  Thus, the end date for this contract will depend on the construction duration of the last construction project assigned.    \n \n1.2.  ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT\nThis contract modification is to be $4,147,800.00.  Modifications will be performed on an as needed basis for future funding needs.  It is anticipated that total spending during the term of the project could total $27,206,600.00 as shown below:\n \nCost summary: \n                     Original Contract (PO416847, ORD 2329-2023)                                               $3,058,800.00\n                     Modification #1 (current)                                                                                                                              $4,147,800.00\n                     Modification #2 (future, estimated)                                                                                    $8,000,000.00 \n                     Modification #3 (future, estimated)                                                                                    $7,000,000.00 \n                     Modification #4 (future, estimated)                                                                                    $3,500,000.00\n                     Modification #5 (future, estimated)                                                                                    $1,500,000.00\n                     ESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                    $27,206,600.00\n \n1.3.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4.  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe City project team identified the services that would be needed for each project over the modification period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services using existing contract job titles, hourly rates, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project team and subsequently revised by the consultant based on the City project team’s comments.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis Professional Construction Management contract will support various projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects will maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the Central Ohio area.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nMost projects will be located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public and for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for projects that occur outside of secure areas.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying DPU’s environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHill International, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC000990 and expires 11/30/2025.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThese contracts were bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractors submitted with their bid responses, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% for both of these contracts.  Failure by the contractors to meet this goal subjects the contractors to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the bid documents for this contract.\n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $4,147,800.00 are available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within Fund 6006 (Water Bond Fund) is also needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to add funding for the Professional Construction Management 2023 project with Hill International;
