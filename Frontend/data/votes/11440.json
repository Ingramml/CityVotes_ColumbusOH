    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew contracts for Property Maintenance and Lawn Mowing services for properties held by the Division of Land Redevelopment in an amount up to $1,075,000.00.  Services include trash and debris removal from structures, cleaning and abatement of vacant lots, lawn mowing, tree services, brush clearing, trash pickup, and similar work. \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ026253 through the Vendor Services portal on November 17, 2023, and accepted proposals for property and lawn maintenance services through the Bonfire portal on December 15, 2023.  A total of nineteen (19) responses were received.  A total of 13 contractors were selected by an evaluation committee consisting of Staff from the Department of Development and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  The qualifications were based on prior experience, equipment, staffing, and other factors.  The resulting contracts were established for one year with an option to extend an additional year.  \nWith the approval of Ordinances 0681-2024 and 0749-2024, the Department established 10 contracts for property maintenance services and 8 contracts for lawn maintenance, with a total of 13 contractors being selected, with some contractors performing both property and lawn maintenance services.  A bid waiver was required to enter into these contracts as the Request for Statement of Qualifications (City Code 329.27) process allows agencies to award only professional service contracts, and technical proposals were not requested from offers, since we provided technical specification requirements to follow.   \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue mowing and property maintenance services this spring, renew the existing contracts before their current expiration, and to decrease the amount of time the Land Bank will be without property maintenance contractors.  \n \nVendor renewal amounts and fiscal information is located in Exhibit A, attached to this ordinance.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the Land Management Fund, fund 2206.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \n \n Below are the various vendors, vendor numbers, and their contract compliance expiration dates. \nConsolidated Services & Management LLC   CC-012297 Expires 02/28/2026\nLima Jean J.   CC-003246 Expires 01/03/2027\nL.
