    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend two (2) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to obtain Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key-4 Supply Inc., CC#049181 expires 5/21/2026 and Carmen’s Distribution Systems, Inc., CC#005749 expires 12/28/2025.  These contracts provide sanitary paper products for various City of Columbus agencies.  This modification is necessary to ensure a contract is available so that sanitary paper products and dispensers can be purchased as needed for City of Columbus use.  \n \nThese contracts, PO260894 (Key 4 Supply Inc.) and PO260908 (Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc.) were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ016972 and authorized under Ordinance Number 0121-2021 and will expire February 28, 2025.\n \nThere are no changes in the type of products being procured.  The original contract was formally bid.  The original terms and conditions of the previous contract remain in effect. The contracts will expire on 2/28/2025.  There isn’t enough time to do a formal bid process to award a new contract and the City cannot go without sanitary paper products which are used in restrooms and other areas throughout City facilities.  These items are needed for safety hygiene and the prevention of spreading germs and diseases.  It is therefore imperative that the contracts be modified to allow for an extension through June 30, 2025 to ensure these products are readily available through these suppliers.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency because the current contract expires February 28, 2025 and sanitary paper products and dispensers are needed at all City locations.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contracts.  Citywide agencies must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key-4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution Systems, Inc., and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into two (2) Universal Term Contracts for Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers for use by citywide agencies; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing Universal Term Contracts with Key-4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc., and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City agencies, as the current contracts expire on February 28, 2025, in that it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts to maintain a continual supply of sanitary paper products and dispensers, all for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts to obtain Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key-4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc. for a period of four (4) months, from February 28, 2025 up to and including June 30, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
