    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects to add additional funds for Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project.  This modification is to design Blossom Field Boulevard from Broad Street to Westbourne Avenue.\nOrdinance No. 1934-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $500,000.00 professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects for the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project.   This project consists of constructing, resurfacing, widening, new curb and gutter, sidewalks, drives, storm sewer system, and a shared use path on Westbourne Avenue from approximately 600 feet west of Taylor Station Road to Blossom Field Boulevard. This project will also include a roundabout and new alignment on Corrina Drive south of the roundabout.\n \nOrdinance 0438-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $675,000.00 to cover the remainder of the design of Phase 1.  \n \nOrdinance 2601-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $300,000.00 to create a new public street where a private street (Blossom Field Boulevard) exists from E. Broad Street to approximately 1,800 feet north of E. Broad Street. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $100,000.00 for additional design work for Blossom Field Blvd detailed design.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $100,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00     (PO241932, Ord. 1934-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $675,000.00     (PO315613, Ord. 0438-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $300,000.00     (PO417530, Ord. 2601-2023)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                      $100,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $1,575,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary as a result of design changes that occurred after the initial contract fee had been negotiated and cannot be covered by contract contingency. Work includes drainage and roadway updates necessary due to design changes on adjoining E Broad Phase I widening project, drainage and SCP design updates based on updated direction from DOSD, and design updates related to Blacklick Skilled Nursing facility development.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis work is within the project limits of the original contract. It would be redundant to have a separate contract to perform this work.  Therefore, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects is CC001829 and expires 12/28/25.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 4432 (Lucent Commercial TIF).  Funds will need to be appropriated in Fund 4432, transferred to Fund 7432 (Lucent Commercial TIF Capital Fund), and then appropriated in Fund 7432.  Project expenses will be paid from Fund 7432. \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete plan design, which needs to be bid in April 2025 in order to meet the agreed upon deadline for waterline installation and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the Lucent Commercial TIF; to transfer funds from the Lucent Commercial TIF to the Lucent Commercial TIF Capital Fund; to appropriate funds within the Lucent Commercial TIF Capital Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects in connection with the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Lucent Commercial TIF Capital Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is engaged in the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Phase 1 project will include constructing, resurfacing, widening, new curb and gutter, sidewalks, drives, storm sewer system, and a shared use path on Westbourne Avenue from approximately 600 feet west of Taylor Station Road to Blossom Field Boulevard as well as a roundabout and new alignment on Corrina Drive south of the roundabout; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Phase 2 project creates a new public street where a private street (Blossom Field Boulevard) exists from E.
