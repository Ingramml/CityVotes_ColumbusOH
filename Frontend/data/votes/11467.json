($25,093.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City receives annual grant allocations from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH), combined with funding originating from the Office of Population Affairs, Health Resources and Services Administration under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration which supports the Reproductive Health and Wellness Grant Program (RHWP) at Columbus Public Health. This grant is comprised of three funding sources for this grant and thus there are three project numbers associated per grant award. In order to properly align appropriations with expenditures, it is necessary to authorize an appropriation transfer in the Health Department Grant Funds for the FY22 and FY23 RHWP which allows for the full reconciliation and grant close-out for these grants.\nFor FY22 RHWP, ODH, as the grantor, issued payments that differ from their original NOA for the period of April 1, 2021 through December 31, 2022 in the amount of $8,193.00. The original acceptance and appropriation Ordinance 0747-2021 passed by Council on April 22, 2021. \nSimilarly for FY23 RHWP, ODH issued payments that differ from their original NOA for the period of April 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023 in the amount of $16,900.00. The original acceptance and appropriation Ordinance 0901-2022 passed by Council on April 20, 2022. \nThis ordinance will also authorize the transfer of appropriations between grant numbers established in the Health Department Grant Fund which is reflected in the attached appropriation template. This ordinance also authorizes additional transfers of appropriations between object classes upon request by the Columbus Public Health department in order to reconcile and close-out the grant. \nFISCAL IMPACT: Appropriations will be transferred within the Health Department Grant Fund. ($25,093.00)\nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of appropriations from the Health Department Grant Fund to reflect the originating funding sources from the Ohio Department of Health for the FY22 and FY23 Reproductive Health and Wellness Grant Program (RHWP); to authorize additional transfers of appropriations between object classes upon request. ($25,093.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, a transfer of appropriations between grant numbers for the FY22 and FY23 Reproductive Health and Wellness Grant Program (RHWP) is needed by the Columbus Public Health department to reconcile and close-out the grant; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the City Auditor to transfer any appropriations between object classes for the FY22 and FY23 Reproductive Health and Wellness Grant Program (RHWP) as needed upon request by the Columbus Public Health department; and \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Columbus Public Health department to properly align appropriations to promote accurate accounting and financial management of grant funds; NOW THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nSECTION 1.
