    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks, on behalf of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA), to enter into contract with the Tony R. Wells Foundation to act as the fiscal administrator for COAAA’s Housing Assistance Program in 2025. \nCOAAA has been awarded funds from the Ohio Department of Aging to administer the Housing Assistance Program. The COAAA Housing Assistance Program includes preventative efforts to reduce eviction, displacement, and homelessness for older adults in the Central Ohio region, including Delaware, Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Licking, Madison, Pickaway, and Union counties. The focus of the program is diversion: keeping older adults out of the shelter, as well as prevention, to keep from reaching a housing crisis. COAAA has staff working daily on supporting older adults through housing crises. With staffing already in place, these funds address needs such as a missed rent or mortgage, rent or utility deposit, housing violation moving expenses, or other hardships related to maintaining safe housing that can lead to displacement. \nAs the fiscal administrator for this program, the Tony R. Wells Foundation will distribute rental assistance payments to landlords of older adults that have been screened and vetted by COAAA staff. This partnership allows COAAA to issue payments quickly and efficiently to residents in need of emergency assistance. \nApproximately 200 individuals are expected to be served by this program. \nFISCAL IMPACT: The contract between the Wells Foundation and the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging will extend to December 31, 2025. This agreement has a defined budget of $366,360.00 in assistance payments plus the Wells Foundation Service Fee of $33,640.00 for a total of $400,000.00.\nPRINCIPLE PARTY:\nTony R.
