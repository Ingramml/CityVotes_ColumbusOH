The Orion Project Management Information System (PMIS) is a web-based electronic project management system to facilitate supervision and administration of projects, contracts, tasks, budget, and schedules along with construction documents such as Submittals, Requests for Information, Request for Proposals, and Pay Applications via the Construction Management side of the program. PMIS support services and upgrade enhancements are ongoing and additional funding has been provided as modification to prior contracts. The agreement for this service will be established in accordance with the pertinent provisions for Sole Source Procurement of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \n \nThe City of Columbus began using a software solution for capital project management under the Professional Program Management contract for the Department of Public Utilities’ Wet Weather Program in 2006. PMIS was highly effective, and the City determined that expanded use of PMIS could potentially benefit other divisions within the Department of Public Utilities and other City departments as well. The City was able to determine that the current PMIS, developed by Malcolm-Pirnie (now Arcadis U.S., Inc.) could be cost-effectively expanded to serve the needs of both the Department of Public Utilities and other departments city-wide.\n \nThe original contract PO127028 was established in accordance with the pertinent provisions for Sole Source Procurement of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code and authorized under Ordinance No. 0403-2018.

This Renewal No. 6 is to provide the necessary funding for the continuation of the Orion Project Management Information System (PMIS) Support Services. The amount of additional funds for Renewal No. 6 is to add $260,190.00. Total amount including this renewal is $2,234,490.00. This contract shall not automatically renew.
