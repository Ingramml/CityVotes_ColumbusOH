    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with EMH&T (Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc.)  to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - Livingston Avenue - 18th Street to Nelson project.\nOrdinance 1482-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with EMH&T (Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc.) to provide the City of Columbus design improvements to the Livingston Avenue corridor from 18th Street to Nelson Road.  A safety study was initiated by the City that included public engagement with a steering committee made up of community members. The resulting recommendation is to perform a lane reallocation to reduce the travel lanes and provide improvements that will increase safety for all users.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,380,000.00.\n \nOrdinance 2862-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to formally apply for a Safe Streets and Road for All Grant for the Livingston Avenue corridor between 18th Street and Nelson Road.  The City was successful and received an award of $12,000,000.00 to complete the construction portion of the project.  The award stipulates that the project must be completed five years from the time the grant agreement is executed.  In order to meet this timeline, design of the project must be expedited, necessitating the need for an emergency legislation request.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $1,380,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $1,700,000.00    (PO391330, Ord. 1482-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,380,000.00    (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $3,080,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe project has been expedited to meet the schedule requirements of the Safe Street for All (SS4A) grant from FHWA.  The total cost, and timing of those funds, for the design effort were unknown at the time the 2024 capital improvement budget was prepared.  The funds are needed now to continue the design process in a manner to fulfill the schedule obligations of the SS4A grant.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe detailed design is integral with the previous work performed on the contract and timely completion is required in order to maintain the schedule for leveraged grant funding. Bidding out the work would require more time than is available and increase costs.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe hours required for these tasks were deemed fair and reasonable when compared to other projects of similar scope and complexity.  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against EMH&T (Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc.).\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for EMH&T (Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc.). is CC004214 and expires 11/08/25.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,200,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \nFunding in the amount of $180,000.00 is available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  It will be necessary to amend the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget to align budget authority with the proper project.  The funds are appropriated.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner to prevent delays in the project schedule and meet deadlines for leveraged grant funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with EMH&T in connection with the Roadway - Livingston Avenue - 18th Street to Nelson project; to authorize an expenditure from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund and the Water Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,380,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
