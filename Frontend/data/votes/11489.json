    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Michael Schuster Associates, Inc. DBA MSA Design for the Northeast Indoor Aquatics Center - Phase 1a Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $2,000,000.00.\n \nThe 2020 Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan (ACIP) paved the way and identified the needs for a new indoor aquatic facility. This document presented a comprehensive long-term plan that evaluates and prioritizes improvements to the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s aquatic programs and facilities to better serve the community.\nThe ACIP summarized that swimming is a vital life skill that offers health and wellbeing. Pools are a strong root of neighborhood pride that offers opportunities to exercise, gather, and connect. It is also important to note that 64% of African American and 45% of Hispanic children have low or no swimming ability. Children within these groups of the same age are statistically 5.5 times more likely to drown than their white counterparts. Drowning remains in the top five reasons for unintentional injury resulting in death from birth to age 54.\nThe Northeast Indoor Aquatics Center will be located on a parcel that fronts Agler Road between Sunbury Road and Cassady Avenue. Currently, the Recreation and Parks Department is in negotiations with Columbus City Schools (CCS) for the transfer and annexation of approximately 11 acres for the construction of this aquatic center.\nIt is the intent that CCS students will have use of the Indoor Aquatics Center during the school day, as well as after school in support of athletic program. Columbus City Schools and the Recreation and Parks Department are committed to this partnership serving as a model for future projects.\nAlthough the final building has not been finalized, the Recreation and Parks Department has identified the project to be approximately a 75,000 square foot facility. It will include an a eight lane Olympic-size competition pool, community multi-use space, warm water therapy pool, diving pool, leisure pool, spectator space, and supporting space.\nThe aquatic center and athletic fields are Phase 1 of a multiphase project. Phase 2 of this project will include construction of the replacement of Howard Community Center and a joint athletic complex to be used with CCS. Phase 3 is the development of a school campus by CCS. This project will focus on Phase 1. However, an overall site master plan is required to identify a phased development strategy for the entire 32.4 acre site.\nProject completion is currently projected for late 2028. In addition to this request, three additional modifications with design professionals are anticipated to complete the project. This request includes schematic design of the center, preliminary engineering, and master planning for all three phases of this development, including traffic and storm water management. Additionally, it includes preliminary structural design and geotechnical engineering for the improvements. A land transfer and annexation of the 11 acre site from CCS, in conjunction with Mifflin Township, to the City of Columbus where the aquatic center will be built is also included. \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Proposals were advertised to firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RSFQ) process, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 9, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 24, 2024.
