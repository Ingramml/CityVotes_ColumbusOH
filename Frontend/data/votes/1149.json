    "description": "Title\n \nTo Encourage Residents to Celebrate Summer Holidays Safely and Responsibly without the use of Illegal Fireworks  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the founding of our country on July 4th and other summertime celebrations are marked by family and community celebrations; and\n \nWHEREAS, celebrations featuring backyard fireworks, which are illegal to purchase, sell, or discharge within city limits, under section 2533.03 of the Columbus City Code, pose serious fire and safety hazards to city residents and city property; and \n \nWHEREAS, residents are urged to avoid making and/or discharging their own fireworks and instead attend public firework shows where fireworks use and discharge is conducted by authorized and trained personnel; and                      \n \nWHEREAS, residents are urged not to allow children to hold, light or otherwise handle sparklers and other fireworks all of which can cause serious injury; and             \n \nWHEREAS, the recent passage of Senate Bill 113 in the Ohio Senate, which would allow the possession of consumer-grade fireworks in Ohio, will create negative consequences including, but not limited to, potential property damage, threats to personal and public safety, and negative impact on combat veterans and others who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder; and          \n  \nWHEREAS, residents are urged to observe and obey local, state and national laws governing the sale and discharge of fireworks; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby encourage residents to celebrate summer holidays safely and responsibly without the use of illegal fireworks.",
