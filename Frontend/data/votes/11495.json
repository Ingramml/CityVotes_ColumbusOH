($661,500.00) (Amended by ord. 0729-2025 passed on 3/31/2025 -LG).",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Public Safety Director to amend its contract with SoundThinking Inc., formerly ShotSpotter Inc., for the use of ShotSpotter, a subscription based service that involves a gunfire sensor network in areas identified by the City. These sensors connect to a cloud-based data center infrastructure, providing a 24/7/365 gunfire monitoring service within a nine (9) square-mile radius of the installed sensor infrastructure.\nIn addition to gunfire detection, the SoundThinking service will notify law enforcement agencies of gunfire incidents and direct them to the precise location of gunfire. The service also offers the capability to instantly notify officers of shootings in progress with real-time data delivered to dispatch officers, patrol cars, and smart phones. The alerts are intended to improve police response to incidents of gunfire, enhance officer safety, speed aid to victims, assist in investigations and the collection of evidence, and ultimately, the apprehension of dangerous offenders. The original contract for services with SoundThinking, formerly ShotSpotter dated October 4, 2018 was established by ordinance 2151-2018.  This amendment will extend the term of the contract through February 6, 2028 and add $1,984,500.00 in funding.  Funding for this contract will be encumbered on a year-to-year basis contingent upon the approval of City Council and certification of funds by the City Auditor.\nBid Waiver Justification: Because of the established relationship with this contractor and the fact that they have technology in place at the required locations to interface with Columbus police equipment, it was not practical to bid out this service and incur start-up fees and breaks in coverage.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested in order to provide continuity to the gunfire detection program without any interruption  \nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $661,500.00 from the General Fund for the first year of a three-year agreement with SoundThinking Inc, formerly ShotSpotter, Inc. for a gunfire location, alert, and analysis system. These funds are available within the 2025 General Fund budget. This ordinance is contingent upon passage of the 2025 Operating Budget via Ordinance 3035-2024.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to amend the contract with SoundThinking Inc., formerly ShotSpotter, Inc. to continue the use of a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis program; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $661,500.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($661,500.00) \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety has determined there is a need to continue the use of the gunfire detection, alert, and analysis service to assist law enforcement responding to incidents of gunfire in Columbus neighborhoods; and,\nWHEREAS, SoundThinking can deliver instant, accurate tactical awareness to the Division of Police including precise location anywhere within the coverage area including latitude/longitude and street address, exact time and number of rounds fired and shooter position, speed and direction of travel; and,\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 because of the established relationship with this contractor and the fact that they have technology in place at the required locations to interface with Columbus police equipment; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety needs to encumber funds for 2025 costs; and,\nWHEREAS, this agreement covers a total radius of 9 square miles; and,\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to amend this contract in order to provide the funds needed for this year's gunshot detection agreement and avoid any interruption in services, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to amend the contract with SoundThinking, Inc. for use of the ShotSpotter system.  This contract provides for a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis system with the capability to be integrated with existing City technology infrastructure in order to adequately capture, layer, and share data across technology platforms.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $661,500.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within Fund 1000 General Fund, Object Class 03 - Contractual Services per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 3. That this Council finds it to be in the best interests of the City to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to Competitive bidding for this purchase and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 4.
