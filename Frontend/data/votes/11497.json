    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services contract modification with Brown and Caldwell Ohio, LLC, for services during construction for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project, CIP #650353-100007, in an amount up to $14,914,610.09. \n \nThe original contract was for preliminary and detailed design services and provided a preliminary design report and design for the installation of Digesters 8 and 9, replacement of the floating covers on Digesters 1-5 and 7, a Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) and high strength organic waste (HSW) receiving station, a combined heat and power (cogeneration) facility to utilize the digester gas, new waste gas burners, and relocation of the gravity bypass at the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n \nThis modification is to fund services for Step 3 - Services during Construction. This will include submittal review, review and answering of Requests For Information, preparation and review of Request For Proposals, and other engineering support services to ensure a successful construction project.\n \nThe Community Planning Area: 64 Far South.  \n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $14,914,610.09\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract (ORD 1297-2023; PO388455)                                          $21,224,775.42\nModification No. 1 (current)                                                                                    $14,914,610.09\nModification No. 2 (future)                                                                 $17,375,250.79\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                      $53,514,636.30\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used \nThis contract was awarded via the City’s Request for Proposal process and intended to last throughout construction of the project.  This modification is a planned modification to add funding for Services during Construction.  Another procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined\nA cost proposal was provided by Brown and Caldwell, based upon existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the Project Team and was deemed acceptable.\n \n1.4. Updated Timeline\nThe total term of the Step 1 Preliminary Design and Step 2: Detailed Design Services contract was twenty one months after the notice to proceed was given.  A Notice To Proceed was given in June of 2023 with bidding completed in September of 2024. This contract modification will partially fund Step 3: Services during Construction and is anticipated to be for six years, ending in September of 2031. A future, second modification will be requested to fully fund this phase of the project.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project was created by combining the SWWTP Cogeneration, SWWTP Digester Expansion, Phase III project, and SWWTP FOG/HSW Receiving Station projects. These projects were combined and accelerated in order to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) rebate program. Under the current guidance provided from the IRS, this project is eligible for up to 50% rebate on the total construction cost. This rebate is expected to save the City of Columbus at least $120,000,000 on the construction and engineering of facilities that were already in the capital budget. \n \nIn addition to IRA rebates, this project is eligible for additional funding and grants due to greenhouse gas reductions, electrical usage reduction, and FOG diversion from landfills.\n \nThe creation of a FOG receiving station will generate a revenue stream from the tipping fees associated with the acceptance of the material. There will also be a reduction in outside electricity demands from the biogas powered generators that will be installed.\n \nFrom an environmental perspective, this project will reduce SWWTP’s greenhouse gas footprint by capturing methane from the digesters.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nBrown and Caldwell’s contract compliance number is CC010815 and expires 10/10/25.\n  \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 13.95% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nBrown and Caldwell Ohio, LLC listed the following companies as subcontractors for this project:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                          ODI Certification Status \nDLZ Ohio, Inc.                                                                                       Columbus, Ohio                                          MBE\nJacobs Engineering Group, Inc.                                           Columbus, Ohio                                          MAJ\nBlack &Veatch Corporation                                               Columbus, Ohio                                          MAJ\nArcadis U.S., Inc.                                                              Columbus, Ohio                                          MAJ\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.                                    Columbus, Ohio                                          MBE\nRegency Construction Services, Inc.                            Columbus, Ohio                                          WBE\nResource International, Inc.                                     Columbus, Ohio                                          WBE\nT&M Associates                                                               Dublin, Ohio                                          MAJ\n \nThe certification of the above companies was in good standing at the time the contract modification.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.  This project is eligible for a Federal Infrastructure Recovery Act (IRA) rebate of at least $120,000,000.00.  A requirement of the IRA is continuity of construction, meaning once construction starts it must be continuous through the completion of the project or eligibility for the IRA rebate is lost.  Construction of equipment to be installed as part of this project began third quarter 2024, starting the continuity of construction requirement.  The construction contract for the facility was bid, only one bid was received, and negotiations were conducted with that bidder to reduce the cost of the facility construction.  The cost reduction resulted in changes to the way the project will be built, requiring design documents to be modified.  These changes to the design documents were unanticipated and must be completed prior to start of the facility construction.  Construction of the facility must begin prior to the equipment construction being completed or continuity of construction will not be achieved and the eligibility for the IRA rebate will be lost. Therefore, work must begin on modifying the design documents as soon as possible to prevent a loss of continuity of construction and jeopardizing the IRA rebate.\n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized applying for these types of loans and the acceptance of the loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This specific project was added to the list after the ordinance was approved.  Per Section 2 of that Ordinance, Council authorized the Director of Public Utilities to add or subtract projects from the list per department need without seeking Council approval to change the list.  Council approval for this loan is requested via this ordinance.  This loan is expected to be approved at the March 2025 OWDA Board meeting. \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Brown and Caldwell Ohio, LLC for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Brown and Caldwell Ohio, LLC and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \nThis ordinance is an emergency ordinance certifying funds against reserve funds so the contract and purchase order can be approved prior to approval by the OWDA Board approval of the loan.  A transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124 in the amount of $ 14,914,610.09 is needed to fund this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the OWDA to reimburse the Sanitary Reserve Fund.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services contract modification with Brown and Caldwell Ohio, LLC, for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project;
