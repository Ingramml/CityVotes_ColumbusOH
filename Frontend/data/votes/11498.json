    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a contract with Sensus USA Inc. to provide ongoing software, hardware, and maintenance of the system required as part of the Enhanced Meter Project (EMP) legislated under Ordinance #1024-2020. Planning area - 99 (Entire service area including suburbs).\n \nThis contract is for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the system and software to ensure the system implemented as part of the EMP is usable. As legislated under Ordinance #1024-2020, the Enhanced Meter Project CIP will replace outdated and underperforming meters, install radio transmitting infrastructure to allow wireless readings relayed to the billing software at a central location, and provide an environmentally efficient way to read meters. \n \nPROCUREMENT:  Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code was followed as part of the Enhanced Meter Project CIP, which was legislated under Ordinance #1024-2020. After proposals were received, the Software-as-a-service (SAAS) contract and cost were negotiated and the department determined the price to be acceptable. During negotiations with the selected vendor for the EMP, the department determined that using a SAAS and Managed Services model, where the vendor hosts all data and software on their computer servers and maintains the system, is in the best interest of the City and the Division of Water. As the meter equipment is proprietary to the vendor, it is in the City’s best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code for the operating portion of the contract.\n \nThe term of the operating contract shall begin on the Effective Date and continue through March 31, 2026 (the “Initial Term”). The Contract is subject to annual funding approval, which will require the authorization of Columbus City Council, the appropriation of additional funds by the Columbus City Auditor, and the execution of a contract modification to increase the maximum obligation.\n \nPer Ordinance 1266-2020, the City may, at its option, perform a contract modification under the same terms and conditions, for fifteen additional one-year terms after the initial term. Costs for any modifications after the initial term will be negotiated at a future date. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the fifth modification for the sixth year of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #5 is $1,200,000.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $4,640,000.00\n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known at the time of the initial contract. \n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used: Regular procurement processes were utilized and this is the fifth year of six authorized modification options.\n4.   How was cost determined: The modification is based upon estimated requirements for 2025 at rates established in the existing contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  Sensus USA, Inc. | D365 Vendor #008960 | Expires 2/2/2026 | \nThe company does not hold MBE or WBE status.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $1,200,000.00 is budgeted and available for this contract.\nThis ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2025 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3036-2024.\n \n$677,749.95 was spent in 2024\n$322,725.27 was spent in 2023  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a contract with Sensus USA, Inc. for ongoing software, hardware, and maintenance of the system for the Enhanced Meter Project for the Division of Water; to authorize the expenditure of $1,200,000.00 from the Water Operating Fund; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code.
