    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into construction contract modifications for the 2024 Water Main Repairs project, CIP #690521-100012, with the following companies:\n•                     Travco Construction Inc., in an amount up to $700,000.00.\n•                     Eramo & Sons Inc., in an amount up to $700,000.00.\n \nThe scope of work for the contract is not changing.  These contracts provide assistance to our water line maintenance crews in completing water main break repairs in a timely matter should the number of breaks exceed our normal maintenance capacities.  These additional funds are being added to the original contract amounts due to higher than anticipated breaks occurring, resulting in a higher than anticipated need for outside assistance in making repairs.  \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,400,000.00 \nThe bid amount and award amount for the Travco Construction contract was $768,352.75, including a 10% construction contingency amount. The modification amount for the Travco Construction contract is $700,000.00, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work. No additional contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: Travco Construction\n \nOriginal Contract (ORD 3346-2023; PO429625)                                               $768,352.75\nModification No. 1 (This Ordinance)                                                           $700,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                  $1,468,352.75\n \nThe bid amount and award amount for the John Eramo & Sons Inc. contract was $802,175.00, including a 10% construction contingency amount.

Reason other procurement processes are not used \nThese contracts were awarded per the City’s IFB process and approved via Ordinance 3346-2023 with a timeline of 730 days from the Notice to Proceed date for work to be completed.  We are still within the contract period.  Another contract could not be bid and awarded in time for assistance to be provided with the existing water line breaks. \n \n1.3. How cost of the modification was determined\nThe cost of the modification was determined by using existing line items and rates on the existing contract and estimating the number of breaks that will occur by the end of the contract.  \n \n1.4 Timeline and future modifications\nThe contract expiration remains two years from the date of the Notice To Proceed.  Future modifications are not anticipated but could be needed if the number of water line breaks remains unusually high.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThese contracts will provide assistance to our water line maintenance crews in completing water main break repairs in a timely matter should the number of breaks exceed our normal maintenance capacities.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nTravco Construction Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC009944 and expires 9/3/26.  Searches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Travco Construction Inc. \n \nJohn Eramo & Sons Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004251 and expires 10/31/25.  Searches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against John Eramo and Sons, Inc.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThese contracts were bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of documentation submitted by Travco Construction Inc. and John Eramo & Sons Inc. with their bid responses, including the Utilization Plan and the Request for MBE/WBE Waiver and Documentation of Good Faith Effort, ODI waived the MBE/WBE Program goal for the Travco Construction, Inc. contract, and accepted a reduced goal of 4.5% for the John Eramo & Sons Inc. contract.\n \nAs part of their original bid, Travco Construction Inc. proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                     City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nDecker Construction Company                 Columbus, Ohio                              MAJ                                 \n \nThe certification of Travco Construction Inc.’s proposed subcontractor was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \nAs part of their original bid, John Eramo & Sons Inc. proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                      City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nDecker Construction Company                  Columbus, Ohio                               MAJ                                 \nNewcomer Concrete                                Norwalk, Ohio                                 MAJ\nDonley Concrete and Sawing                    Pickerington, Ohio                            MAJ\nBridges Brothers Trucking                        Columbus, Ohio                                MBE\n \nThe certification of the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \nThe subcontractors for Travco Construction Inc. and John Eramo & Sons, Inc. will remain the same as their original bids. \n \n5.
