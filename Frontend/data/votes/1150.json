Mitchell in January 2019; and \n \nWHEREAS, NATIONAL CROWN DAY will be a day of solidarity for the human rights of Black men, women and children to wear their natural hair boldly and proudly, without the fear of reprisal; the one-day celebration will feature a full day of virtual conversations; and people are encouraged to use #PassTheCrown on their social media platforms; and \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council recognizes and embraces its obligation to lead particularly during this heightened period of racial injustice and awareness; moreover, this Council calls for the eradication of discrimination in all of its forms, including acts which negatively discriminate against the Black community, including hair discrimination; this Council calls on the Ohio General Assembly and communities around Ohio to adopt legislation Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair; moreover this Council supports the Coalition’s mission of asking the Black community and its allies to share the #PassTheCrown and to encourage their state and federal legislators in states that have not yet passed The CROWN ACT to do so; now therefore, \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nThat this Council does hereby declare July 3, 2021 as NATIONAL CROWN DAY in the City of Columbus and expresses the City’s ongoing support for eliminating racism and implicit bias against natural hair",
