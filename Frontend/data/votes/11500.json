    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 and to establish a service contract with Reeves Towing and Recovery LLC for the Sign Installation and Towing Services program and to authorize the and expenditure of $20,000.00.  \n \nThe purpose of the Sign Installation and Towing Services program is to provide services that will involve, but not be limited to:  responding to calls from the City for the installation of “NO PARKING” signage per Ohio Revised Code 4513.601 and later removal of vehicles from Land Bank properties if the vehicle is not removed within 48 hours of signage installation; impound and storage of vehicles by order of the private property owner (City of Columbus); proper notification of the last known owner of such vehicles, as required by law; and release of vehicles to the owner or lien holder as required by law for properties held by the Land Redevelopment Division.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to provide services without interruption.\n \nBid Waiver Justification:  The Department of Development advertised RFQ026787 on Vendor Services in February 2024 for the Sign Installation and Towing Services program and one bid was received.  The Director of Development entered into contract with this bidder under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  The contract period was from the date of approval of the purchase order to February 28, 2025, with an option to renew one additional year, through 2026.  However, the original contract was not legislated and approval was, likewise, not received from City Council to renew the agreement.  As just one bid has been received the last three times this service was competitively bid, a waiver of competitive bidding is requested to go into a new contract for 3/1/25 - 2/28/26.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the Land Management Fund, fund 2206.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 032297 and expires 11/6/2025.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to establish a service contract with Reeves Towing and Recovery LLC for the Sign Installation and Towing Services program; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $20,000.00; and to declare an emergency ($20,000.00).\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Development is requesting to establish a service contract for the Sign Installation and Towing Services program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the purpose of the Sign Installation and Towing Services program is to provide services that will involve, but not be limited to:  responding to calls from the City for the installation of “NO PARKING” signage per Ohio Revised Code 4513.601 and later removal of vehicles from Land Bank properties if the vehicle is not removed within 48 hours of signage installation; impound and storage of vehicles by order of the private property owner (City of Columbus); proper notification of the last known owner of such vehicles, as required by law; and release of vehicles to the owner or lien holder as required by law for properties held by the Land Redevelopment Division; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize a waiver of the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes as there is not enough time to obtain formally advertised, competitive sealed bids; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into this contract to continue program services without interruption as the current contract is set to expire February 28, 2025, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to establish a service contract with Reeves Towing and Recovery LLC, in an amount up to $20,000.00, for the Sign Installation and Towing Services program.\n \nSECTION 2:  That for the purpose as stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $20,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized in fund 2206 (Land Management Fund), Dept. 44-11 (Land Redevelopment), in Object Class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3:  That this Council finds it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes to enter into this contract and such are hereby waived.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
