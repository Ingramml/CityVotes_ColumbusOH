    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance approves the acceptance of certain territory (AN24-009) by the city of Columbus. The Ohio Revised Code stipulates that to be effective, City acceptance must take place a minimum of 60 days from the receipt by the City Clerk of the approval notice from the county.

Franklin County approved the annexation on October 15, 2024 and the City Clerk received notice on January 2, 2025. \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \nTitle\nTo accept the application (AN24-009) of Michael P.
