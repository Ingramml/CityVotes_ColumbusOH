The scope of work for this project includes improvements to doors, interior and exterior lights, sinks and mirrors in the bathrooms, as well as alternate flooring work, painting work, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract in accordance with the bidding documents.\n \n2. CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The project was let by the Office of Construction Management through Vendor Services and Bid Express.  Of the 535 vendors solicited, 193 were Minority-owned, 2 were Veteran-owned, 321 were Small Business-owned, and 112 were Women-owned.\n \nThe Director of Finance and Management publicly opened four bids on January 14, 2025. Two of the four bidders held Minority-designated status.\n \n                                       Bid Total                     \nServant’s Heart Gen’l Contracting, LLC (WBE)                     $107,400.00                     \nBlack Bronco Construction (MBE)                     $117,000.00\nSetterlin Building Company                     $211,342.00\nt-built construction services                     $216,400.00\n \nServant’s Heart General Contracting, LLC’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $107,400.00.  Their Contract Compliance Number is 44621 (expires 10/2/26, Woman-owned designation).   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Servant’s Heart General Contracting.\n \n3.
