Genesis will be replaced with Talkdesk in July 2025. Responder and Talkdesk will not integrate natively, so a custom solution is required. Schneider Electric will build the custom integration during this project by replacing the current RxIF IVR Adapter implementation with a custom Multipeak integration with Talkdesk to the Responder application.\n \nThis ordinance also requests approval to enter into the above-mentioned contract in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Codes, as it has been determined that Schneider Electric Smart Grid Solutions LLC, is the sole provider and sole owner of the Responder software solution.\n \nThe total expenditure of $153,600.00 being authorized by this ordinance is comprised of two parts. First is $128,000.00 for the above-described services.
