    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Burgess & Niple to add additional funds for Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Broad Street - Outerbelt Street to Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road project.  \nOrdinance No. 1185-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $500,000.00 professional services contract with Burgess & Niple for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Broad Street - Outerbelt Street to Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road project.   The intent of this project is to design improvements to the East Broad Street corridor from Outerbelt Street to Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road.  This is the second phase of a major widening project to construct new through and turn lanes of various configurations in the E. Broad Street corridor from the east side of the I-270 interchange to the intersection of E. Broad Street and Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road.  \n \nOrdinance 0690-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,900,000.00 for detail design once the study from the original contract was accepted.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $200,000.00 for additional professional services to complete the detailed design of the project.\n \nOrdinance 1658-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission relative to the MORPC Attributable Funds Program, accept and expend awarded grant funds, and issue refunds, if necessary, for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Broad Street - Outerbelt Street to Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road.\n \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $200,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00     (PO227997,   Ord. 1185-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,900,000.00  (PO377963, Ord. 0690-2023)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $200,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $2,600,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary as a result of design changes that occurred after the initial contract fee had been negotiated and cannot be covered by contract contingency. Work includes additional lighting, signal, and interconnect work, Roadway Subsummaries and Drainage Subsummaries, and performing a Noise Analysis and a Qualitative Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) Analysis per ODOT's direction, all of which were not included in the original base fee. Work also includes the addition of Pavement Elevation sheets and Waterline sheets, that were not included in the original scope or base fee. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis work is within the project limits of the original contract. It would be redundant to have a separate contract to perform this work.  Therefore, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the Ciy to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Burgess & Niple.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Burgess & Niple is CC004425 and expires 01/10/26.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 4428, the E. Broad Dominion TIF Fund.  It is necessary to appropriate funds and then transfer cash to Fund 7428, E. Broad Dominion TIF Capital Fund to expend funds.  It is also necessary to appropriate the funds.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete plan design that affects the Right of Way design, which needs to be completed this spring so that Acquisition can begin in April 2025 and meet the MORPC funding dates to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the E.
