    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Complete General Construction Company for the Bridge Rehabilitation - Whittier Street Bridge Rehab and SUP Widening project in an amount up to $100,000.00.\nOrdinance 3243-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Complete General Construction Company for the construction of the Bridge Rehabilitation - Whittier Street Bridge Rehab and SUP Widening project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.\n \nThe work performed to date for this project consists of rehabilitation of the Whittier Street Bridge over CSX and NS Railroads and the approach roadway work necessary for the widening of the existing sidewalk into a 10-foot-wide shared use path (SUP) between Front Street and 1250 feet west of Front Street at the existing Scioto River Trail access point.\n \nThe work for modification 1 will consist of a bridge deck overlay of the Whittier Street bridge along with the associated mobilization and maintenance of traffic. The work is expected to take 30 days and will be scheduled with the remaining work on the contract., and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $100,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                               $3,311,062.04   (PO432311/PO432325, Ord. 3243-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                        $100,000.00      (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:       $3,411,062.04  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis was not an anticipated modification. During the course of construction, it was determined that the bridge deck was in a worse condition than it was at the time of project scoping. A bridge deck overlay is now required to extend the life of the bridge deck and preserve the bridge long term.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe bridge is currently partially closed for construction with significant maintenance of traffic impacts. This bridge deck overlay can be added to the current work with minimal impact to the public and more economically. Performing this work on a separate contract would cost more and have more impact to the public.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Complete General Construction Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Complete General Construction Company is CC006056 and expires 05/10/2025.\n \n \n3.  Pre-Qualification Status\nComplete General Construction Company and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $100,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  It is necessary to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget to establish sufficient budget authority for this project. Funds are appropriated.  \n \n5. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure that funding is available to facilitate the commencement of construction work as soon as the construction season begins and prevent any unnecessary delays in the completion of modification 1 for the Bridge Rehabilitation - Whittier Street Bridge Rehab project to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Complete General Construction Company in connection with the Bridge Rehabilitation - Whittier Street Bridge Rehab project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
