    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with OHM Advisors for the Tree Nursery Relocation Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $97,000.00.\n \nThe current 45 acre City of Columbus tree nursery, operated by the Recreation and Parks Department, is located on city property managed by the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). DPU is expanding their adjacent Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant with construction to begin in 2027. As a result, the Recreation and Parks Department will lose access to this location. The current site provides space to grow over 11,000 trees. It also has related infrastructure, including irrigation and greenhouses. In order to continue growing trees for installation throughout the city, the Recreation and Parks Department will need to relocate the nursery and staff. The planning and design of a new nursery needs to begin immediately so that it is ready for operations when the existing nursery needs to be vacated. This will also allow the newly planted trees at the existing nursery to be of the appropriate transplant size in approximately three years when they will need to be relocated. \n \nThe proposed sites for the relocation of the nursery are Three Creeks Park or an alternative site that better meets specific operational and environmental criteria. The nursery relocation will progress as planned, with a target plant-out date of fall 2025. The location will be selected based on its suitability for tree growth, logistical considerations, and compliance with city regulations. This project will determine the areas and infrastructure necessary for the new tree nursery. The project will also include fencing to deter animals from damaging the trees and an irrigation system to keep the trees watered. There will also be efforts to delineate and protect wetlands at this site, if applicable. There will be future phases to this project that will include design for forestry staff and equipment facilities.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Proposals were advertised to firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RSFQ) process, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 29, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 16, 2024.
