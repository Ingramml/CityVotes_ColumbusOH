    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Human Resources to enter into a service contract with Mount Carmel HealthProviders Inc., in the amount of up to $430,000.00 for the Occupational Safety and Health Medical Services Clinic contract.\n \nIn 1984, the City responded to concerns raised by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding potential exposures to employees at the City’s trash-burning power plant.  The City began testing employees at the Columbus Department of Health.  In particular, the Occupational Safety and Health Clinic provided medical surveillance examinations, pre-placement examinations, immunizations, health and fitness assessments, clearance for respirator wear, assessment of workers’ fitness for duty, consultation, hearing conservation training, and audiometric testing.\n \nIn 2006, Columbus Public Health restructured its focus from internal safety assessments to monitoring community health status, public health threats, and preventing/controlling disease.  The City then shifted the operations of employee occupational safety and health medical services from Columbus Public Health to the Department of Human Resources.  This was done to provide focused and coordinated occupational safety and health medical services in accordance with the Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), OSHA, and the State Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC).\n \nCurrently, the Occupational Safety and Health Clinic provides surveillance exams and appropriate follow-up to at-risk City employees, identifies occupational-related disease or disability, assists in rehabilitation activities, determines fitness and suitability for assigned work, and promotes and maintains PERRP/OSHA compliance.  The Clinic also promotes employee health, wellness, and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease/injury, assisting in injury care and rehabilitation activities, and providing educational and training programs promoting employee wellness and safe work practices.\n \nThe Department of Human Resources solicited Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the Occupational Safety and Health Medical Services Clinic contract.  The RFP was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire website from August 14, 2024, to September 27, 2024.  The city received four (4) responses.  Three (3) proposals were deemed responsive and were fully evaluated.  Marathon Heath did not submit a responsive proposal.  The responding firms were:  \n \nCompany Name                                                                                                         City/State                                          Diversity Compliance\nMount Carmel HealthProviders Inc.                                                               Cleveland, OH                                          Majority\nOhioHealth Corporation                                                                                    Columbus, OH                                          Majority                     \nConcentra                                                                                                         Addison, TX                                          Majority\nMarathon Health                                                                                                         Indianapolis, IN                                          Majority\n \nMount Carmel HealthProviders Inc. received the highest score from the evaluation committee and will be awarded the Occupational Safety and Health Medical Services Clinic contract.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Mount Carmel HealthProviders Inc.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nMount Carmel HealthProviders Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-005227, expiring on 7/22/2026.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be available within Fund 5502, the Employee Benefits Fund.  This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2025 Other Funds operating budget, Ordinance 3036-2024.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so the Occupational Safety and Health Medical Services Clinic may continue without disruption, given that the prior year’s contract expires on February 28, 2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Human Resources to enter into a service contract with Mount Carmel HealthProviders Inc. for the Occupational Safety and Health Medical Services Clinic; to authorize the expenditure of up to $430,000.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency.
