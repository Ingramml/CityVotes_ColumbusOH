    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Human Resources to transfer funds and appropriate amounts up to the amount of wellness credit invoice credits received within the Employee Benefits Fund to use the credit to promote wellness initiatives and programs for the City of Columbus employees.\n \nFor over two decades, United HealthCare has been the healthcare provider for the City of Columbus.  During this time, the City of Columbus has received an annual wellness credit to promote wellness initiatives and programs for our employees.  In 2024, the Department of Human Resources requested to receive the wellness credit via check instead of United Healthcare paying the invoices related to our wellness-related initiatives.  United Healthcare approved this request and sent us the funding.\n \nIn 2025, United Healthcare agreed to issue the Department of Human Resources a monthly credit invoice for $6.00 per City of Columbus employee on the healthcare plan.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe Department of Human Resources will receive monthly credit invoices from United Healthcare to reduce expenses for the wellness credit.  The Auditor’s Office will transfer the cash from the savings resulting from the credit invoices and appropriate the monies in Fund 5502 (Employee Benefits Fund).  This ordinance appropriates the funds and allows for needed purchases to be made while this program is in force.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is respectfully requested so the department can continue wellness initiatives and programs without interruption.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer of funds between subfunds of the Employee Benefits Fund; to authorize appropriation up to the amount of wellness credits received and funds transferred in the Employee Benefits Fund to allow the Department of Human Resources to promote wellness initiatives and programs for the City of Columbus employees; and to declare an emergency.
