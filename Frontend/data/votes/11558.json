    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to accept two grants in the amount of $25,000 from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners and to appropriate from the unappropriated balance of the general government grant fund.\n \nThe work release grant is for $10,000 and will fund services provided by Alvis, Inc. for defendants to stay out of jail and retain their employment.  Defendants reside at Alvis at all times except when released for work.    \n \nThe unleashing potential (UP) grant is for $15,000 and will fund services provided by Think, Make, Live, Youth (TMLY) for emerging adults (ages 18-25).  TMLY provides participants with access to public assistance programs, acquiring identification, securing reliable transportation, mental and physical health assessment and treatment, housing, career and education counseling, and ongoing mentorship and support.  TMLY uses credible messengers to connect with young people with similar backgrounds and exemplify transformation.  These are services that the court does not provide.  \n \nEmergency Legislation is requested so the grant funds can be used as close to the grant start date as possible. This will allow the services to continue without the use of the general fund, preserving general fund revenue. The grant funds must be used within the grant term (1/1/25 - 6/30/25).\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT $25,000.00 will be expended from the General Governmental Grant Fund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Administrative Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to accept two grant awards from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners; to appropriate $25,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the general government grant fund to the Franklin County Municipal Court for the purpose of providing work release and UP services for defendants; and to declare an emergency.  ($25,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the city's best interest that the Franklin County Municipal Court receive support to allow defendants to retain employment and stay out of jail, and provide services to emerging adults; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the city's best interest that the Franklin County Municipal Court receive support for these defendants; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City in that it is immediately necessary to approve the acceptance of these grants so that the grant funds can be used prior to the expiration (6/30/25) of the grants; now, therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court be and is hereby authorized to accept a grant in the amount of $25,000.00 from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners.\n \nSECTION 2. Funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated.  That from the unappropriated balance in the general government grant fund, fund 2220, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and appropriated for any other purpose during the months ending June 30, 2025, the sum of $25,000.00 is appropriated to the Franklin County Municipal Court according to the account codes in the attachment.\n \nSECTION 3. That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4. At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grant is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements\n \nSECTION 5.   That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
