    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify and increase the Professional Architect-of-Record (A/R) Services agreement, with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (hereinafter “AECOM”), for the Department of Public Safety’s Real Time Crime Center & Public Safety Operations Campus project, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, in an amount up to $2,100,000.00. \n \nThe City of Columbus Public Safety Campus (PSC) will enhance the City’s public safety and security. The campus will include a main building housing the Real Time Crime Center, a 911 Emergency Communication Center, an Emergency Operation Center, a Crime Gun Intelligence Center, and a second building for a police substation. The campus will be located on a 10.673-acre site at 757 Carolyn Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43224.\n \nDesign began under the original contract with AECOM (PO420234), authorized under Ordinance No. 2669-2023.  AECOM, City personnel, and stakeholders met to define the project program, staff space, and design / technology requirements, including projections for staff growth through 2035. \n \nThrough the course of this process, the City requested additions to the project program such as the Crime Gun Intelligence Center, the Project Management Office / Administration department, and the relocation of an existing data center (Hammond) to the new Public Safety Campus facility.  The original scope does not fit the project budget so the program must be decreased and requires further value engineering to fit the budget, resulting in a re-design of the project.\n \nThe original agreement did not include an expiration date, however, Articles 7 and 15 of the agreement outlines a possible need and steps required for a modification and/or change order.\n \nModification No. 1 (current) is needed to procure additional funding due to the re-design of the original project.  \n \n2. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.  The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification:  $2,100,000.00  \n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $8,328,810.00  (PO420234)\nModification No. 1 (current):                     $2,100,000.00\nTotal (Original and Mod 1):                     $10,428,810.00\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nProject is being re-designed to fit the budget.\n \nC.  Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\nThe City must maintain the same vendor in order to successfully and efficiently re-design parts of the scope.  If another vendor was selected through other procurement processes, the overall cost of the re-design would increase significantly due to the project management cost of having another vendor included in the project.\n \nD.  How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nThe price was determined by the additional 12 months of design required to bring the project back to 75% Design Development which is the phase to which the original design schedule was placed on hold until the new scope and budget were determined.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: DAX No. 34998, expires 2/17/25, MAJ\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against AECOM.\n \n4.  FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  Future modifications are not expected at this time.  \n \n5. MINORITY PARTICIPATION:  AECOM originally proposed the following minority-designated subcontractors to meet the 25% ODI goal.\n \nCompany Name                                                  City/State                     ODI Designation      \nMoody Nolan                     Columbus/OH                     MBE\nMoody Engineering                     Columbus/OH                     MBE\nResource International                     Columbus/OH                     WBE\nCrawford & Associates Services                     Columbus/OH                     MBE, VBE\n \n6. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  It is requested that this Ordinance be handled in an emergency manner in order to bring the schedule up to date as it was delayed due to the re-design.\n \n7. FISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Safety G.O. Bonds Fund - Fund No. 7701, will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the Professional Architect-of-Record (A/R) Services agreement with AECOM for the Department of Public Safety’s Real Time Crime Center & Public Safety Operations Campus project; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $2,100,000.00 within the Safety G.O.
