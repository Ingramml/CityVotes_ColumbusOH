    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an engineering agreement with AECOM Technical Services, Inc., for professional engineering services for the North Bank Park Closure project for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section on behalf of the Department of Recreation and Parks; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation of up to $21,755.57 within the Recreation and Parks General Obligation Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $21,755.57 from the Recreation General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.  ($21,755.57)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (Mod #1) the professional engineering services agreement with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. for the North Bank Park Closure project (CIP 611709-100000), in an amount up to $21,755.57.  The Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage is managing the contract and this modification on behalf of the Department of Recreation & Parks (CRPD).\n \nThe current project is evaluating the need for repair and the possibilities for modification to the existing stop log gate and sandbag closures associated with the West Columbus Local Protection Project. This modification will add the North Bank Park sandbag closure to the list of closure locations currently being evaluated.\n \nPlanning Area is 55 (Downtown).\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $21,755.57\n                     Original Contract (PO238166)                                          $  249,894.77\n                     Modification #1 (current)                                          $    21,755.57\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                                               $ 271,650.34\n \n Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThe original contract did not anticipate the need or desire of CRPD to investigate the North Bank Park sandbag closure. Through discussion with CRPD related to the responsibility of this closure, it was communicated that DPU was in the process of investigating automated flood barrier protection measures at closure locations associated with the WCLPP. CRPD then requested that the North Bank Park closure location be evaluated as well, if possible. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe design professional has already established relationships with the potential flood barrier manufacturers and has met with CRPD to walk the closure area and discuss their needs and concerns. They are also familiar with the nuances of the project area and the design requirements. Bidding of the contract modification would push completion of the project even further. \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by AECOM Technical Services, Inc., which has been reviewed and confirmed by the Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD) and the Columbus Recreations and Parks Division (CRPD).\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER: 95-2661922 / MAJ/ Exp. 7/22/2022 Vendor No. 010897\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time. \n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: This project will improve flood protection throughout the project area. It is further anticipated that the construction of green infrastructure will have an impact on the local economy by creating the need for personnel to construct and maintain the facilities, as well as obtaining project related materials from local suppliers and vendors.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes the transfer of cash within and appropriation of up to $21,755.57 from the Recreation and Parks General Obligation Bond Fund 7702 to the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage for purposes of modifying an original contract managed by DPU.  This legislation also authorizes an expenditure of up to $21,755.57 from the Recreation and Parks General Obligation Bond Fund 7702.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align authority with the expenditure.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an engineering agreement with AECOM Technical Services, Inc., for professional engineering services for the North Bank Park Closure project for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section on behalf of the Department of Recreation and Parks; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation of up to $21,755.57 within the Recreation and Parks General Obligation Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $21,755.57 from the Recreation General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.  ($21,755.57)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section wishes to modify and increase PO238166 with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. for the North Bank Park Closure project in order to add funding from the Department of Recreation and Parks for work related to the North Bank Park; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation of $21,755.57 within the Recreation and Parks General Obligation Bond Fund 7702; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to authorize an expenditure of up to $21,755.57 from the Recreation and Parks General Obligation Bond Fund 7702; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to align the authority for this expenditure; and \n \nWHEREAS, this Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the City Code pertaining to contract modifications, and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the current contract for the North Bank Park Closure project with AECOM Technical Services, Inc.; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify and increase a professional engineering services agreement with AECOM Technical Services, Inc., 277 W.
