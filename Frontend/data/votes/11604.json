    "description": "Title\n \nTo Celebrate and Recognize the Numerous Contributions of Essential Workers and declare March 15, 2025 as Essential Workers Day\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, on March 11, 2025 will mark 5 years since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic; and\n \nWHEREAS, March 15, 2025 marks the five year anniversary of the national shutdown of the coronavirus pandemic; and\n \nWHEREAS, amid the coronavirus pandemic, essential workers redefined what it truly means to show up for your neighbor. When residents were encouraged to stay at home to be safe, essential workers did not have that option.
