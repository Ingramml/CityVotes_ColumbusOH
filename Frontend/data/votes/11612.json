    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Video Storage for Body Worn Cameras with CDW Government, LLC.  This contract provides for Division of Police body camera video storage, which is migrating to the new system. Video storage for body warn cameras is required to move files to the new system.  There can’t be a lapse in contract which would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Division of Police.  A RFP process is needed to establish a new contract.  There is not enough time to use a procurement process to award a new contract.  Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n \nThe contract, PO063206 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ004361 and authorized for extension under Ordinance Number 0111-2023 and will expire May, 31, 2025.  The City and CDW Government, LLC have agreed to modify the contract for one additional year term subject to approval of proper City Authorities.  The new contract expiration date will be May 31, 2026.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Division of Police must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Video Storage for Body Worn Cameras with CDW Government, LLC.
