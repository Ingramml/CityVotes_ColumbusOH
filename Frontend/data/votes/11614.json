    "title": "To authorize the City Treasurer to extend its contract for procurement cards with US Bank for a two-year period from September 7, 2025, through September 6, 2027. ($0.00) (Amended by ord. 1420-2025 passed on 6/23/2025)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the City of Columbus (City) through its Finance and Management Director, City Treasurer, and City Auditor issued an RFP for implementation of a procurement card (P-Card) pilot program with the possibility of expansion. The items to be covered in the pilot were the payment of airfare, registration, memberships, subscriptions, advertising, dues, online transactions requiring a card, and small purchases under $500 in lieu of petty cash purchases. The benefit the City expected to receive included efficient, cost-effective methods of paying business expenses, and purchasing goods and services.\n \nThe evaluation committee found all respondents to be competent, and, after in-person presentations to the evaluation committee by the two highest ranked Offerors, US Bank received the highest score. The Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board voted to accept US Bank as the procurement card vendor for the City, subject to successful contract negotiations and authorized a five-year term for the contract.  The contract with US Bank began its five-year term on September 7, 2020, with $20,000.00 in funding from the City Treasurer’s Office to cover any expenditures.  As a result of the dollar threshold, it did not require City Council authorization.\n \nIn a normal year, the City Treasurer’s Office would be engaged in a new RFP process for procurement card (PCard) banking services.  However, the initiation of the City’s pilot for its PCard program was roughly coincident with shutdowns associated with COVID-19.  As a result of COVID, the PCard program’s pilot was substantively hampered by the cessation of business travel; attendance at conferences and trainings essentially ground to a halt.\n \nAs a consequence, the Treasurer sought a discussion with the members of the Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board to gather consensus as to what action should be taken with respect to the PCard contract.  It was recommended that the Treasurer should explore the possibility of a contract extension.\n \nThe Treasurer engaged with US Bank and it was determined that US Bank would agree to a contract extension of two years.  The City Treasurer now requests that Columbus City Council authorize a two-year extension of the Treasurer’s Office contract with US Bank from September 7, 2025, to September 6, 2027, subject to approval by Columbus City Council. \n \nContract Compliance:  US Bank, NA 310841368, expiration 1/21/2027.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNo funds are required for this ordinance at this time. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to extend its contract for procurement cards with US Bank for a two-year period from September 7, 2025, through September 6, 2027. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus through its Finance and Management Director, City Treasurer, and City Auditor issued an RFP in 2019 for implementation of a procurement card (P-Card) pilot program with the possibility of expansion; and\n \nWHEREAS, the evaluation committee found US Bank received the highest score. The Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board voted to accept US Bank as the procurement card vendor for the City, subject to successful contract negotiations and authorized a five-year term for the contract; and\nWHEREAS, the initiation of the City’s pilot for its PCard program was roughly coincident with shutdowns associated with COVID-19.  As a result of COVID, the PCard program’s pilot was substantively hampered and a good five-year test of the PCard program was not possible; and\nWHEREAS, the Treasurer sought a discussion with the members of the Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board to gather consensus as to what action should be taken with respect to the PCard contract.  The members recommended that the Treasurer seek a contract extension from US Bank; and\nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer and US Bank agreed to a two-year contract extension, subject to the approval of Columbus City Council.  The City Treasurer now wishes to modify and extend its contract with US Bank, NA for procurement card services for the two-year period from September 7, 2025, to September 6, 2027; and\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the City Treasurer’s Office to authorize the Treasurer to modify and extend its contract with US Bank, NA for procurement card services for the City of Columbus as cited below that are vital for the daily operation of normal business activities of the City of Columbus; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Treasurer is hereby authorized to modify and extend its contract with US Bank, NA for procurement card (PCard) services for the period September 7, 2025, through September 6, 2027.\n \nSECTION 2. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
