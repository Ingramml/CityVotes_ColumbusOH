    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute those documents necessary to release public airport use restrictions on one parcel of real property at Bolton Field Airport; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  In 2007, the City transferred properties in fee title, located in and around Bolton Field Airport, to the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (\"CRAA\").  The City's deed to CRAA contained a restriction limiting the use of these properties to public airport uses.  CRAA has requested that this airport use restriction be released on a parcel identified as Tract 26, being Franklin County Tax Parcel Number 570-154749 in order that CRAA may develop this parcel for purposes other than public airport use.  CRAA Planning & Engineering has verified that there is no foreseeable need to use this parcel for airport operations. The City’s easement rights reserved on this parcel will remain in full force and effect. The following legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute those documents necessary to release and discharge the City's use restrictions relating solely to the real property.\n \nFiscal Impact: N/A\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the City to allow CRAA to proceed with its plans, at the earliest date possible, for the commercial development of this parcel.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute those documents necessary to release public airport use restrictions on one parcel of real property at Bolton Field Airport; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \n WHEREAS, the City restricted the use of all the real property granted to the Columbus Regional Airport Authority (\"CRAA\") to public airport related uses, as recorded in the Quitclaim Deed, Instrument 200712310221193, Franklin County Recorder's Office (\"Quit Claim Deed\"); and,\n \nWHEREAS, CRAA has requested that the City release the public airport use restriction on the real property identified as Tract 26, being Franklin County Tax Parcel 570-154749 to allow CRAA to sell the property for development for commercial use; and  \n \nWHEREAS, CRAA Planning & Engineering has verified that there is no foreseeable need to use these parcels for airport operations; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has been determined that it is in the City’s best interest to release the public airport use restriction on the above referenced parcel and that release of the restriction will not adversely impact City operations; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Department of Finance and Management to execute those documents necessary to release and discharge the public airport use restrictions in order to permit commercial development of the property; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City in that it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to immediately execute those documents necessary to release and discharge the public airport use restrictions on real property identified as Tract 26, being Franklin County Tax Parcel 570-154749, in order to permit the commercial development of the property to occur, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Department and Finance and Management, be and hereby is authorized to execute those documents, as prepared and approved by the Department of Law, necessary to release and discharge the public airport use restrictions on real property identified as Tract 26, being Franklin County Tax Parcel 570-154749, as more fully and accurately described in Exhibit A attached and incorporated herein.  \n \nSECTION 2. That for the reason stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
