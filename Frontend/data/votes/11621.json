    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The City owns or owned Franklin County Tax ID Parcel Nos. 010-054645 (the “NMDA Parcel”) and 010-307276 (as such parcel may have been split, the “Project Site”). North Market Development Authority, Inc. (“NMDA”) leases and operates a public market in a former warehouse (the “North Market”) on the NMDA Parcel. The City selected NM Developer LLC (the “Developer”) from a request for proposals to redevelop the Project Site with a 32-story mixed-use project. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 2135-2023 passed by City Council on July 24, 2023, the City entered into the First Amended and Restated Economic Development Agreement dated August 29, 2023 (the “Restated EDA”) with the NMDA and the Developer. Pursuant to the Restated EDA, the new development on the Project Site will include public parking spaces, an expansion of the North Market, a public atrium, patio, and plaza in support of the North Market, and other public improvements and site work described in the Restated EDA (collectively, the “Public Project”). The Restated EDA also requires the City to design and construct  at a cost of up to $5 million certain streetscape improvements on Vine Street, Wall Street, and Spruce Street surrounding the NMDA Parcel and the Project Site (the “Streetscape Improvements”). \n \nDue to long lead times for certain Streetscape Improvements materials and related services identified by the City and Developer during design (the “Preordered Items”), the Public Project schedule requires the preorder of  the Preordered Items prior to the bidding of the Streetscape Improvements construction, and the Developer is willing to arrange for the purchase of such Preordered Items provided that the costs thereof are promptly reimbursed by the City. Ordinance No. 2135-2023 also authorized the City to enter into that certain Cooperative Agreement dated August 29, 2023 (the “Cooperative Agreement”) with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to provide a portion of the financing for the Public Project (the “Public Improvements Grant”). The Cooperative Agreement allows the Public Improvements Grant to fund any portion of the public work as approved by the City. This ordinance authorizes the City to remit a portion of the Streetscape Improvements capital improvements budget to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to replenish the funds used from the Public Improvements Grant to reimburse the Developer for the Preordered Items in connection with the Streetscape Improvements construction; this legislation does not increase the City’s prior fiduciary commitments under the Restated EDA. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding in the amount of $405,000.00 is available in the Streets and Highways Bonds Fund (7704). A transfer of appropriation is necessary.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Emergency legislation is requested to maintain without delay nor deficit the agreed upon budgets in the Restated EDA in order to allow NM Developer LLC to immediately preorder the materials and related services for the North Market Streetscape project on behalf of the City, which provides a cost savings to the City by being able to procure the materials and related services immediately at a lower price, and prevent a delay in the completion of the associated public projects, which could also increase the costs of those projects.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to expend $405,000.00 of the North Market Streetscape Phase 2 project funds in the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to replenish the North Market CFA Contribution funds in the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget remitted to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority but used by the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to reimburse NM Developer LLC for the preorder of materials and related services for the North Market Streetscape Phase 2 project construction all pursuant to the First Amended and Restated Economic Development Agreement dated August 29, 2023 and the Cooperative Agreement dated August 29, 2023; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare and emergency.
