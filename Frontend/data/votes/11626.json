    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue project.\nOrdinance 2680-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. in an amount of up to $525,000.00 for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue project.  This project consists of improvements to Cassady Avenue from the CSX railroad tracks just north of Delmar Drive to E. 7th Avenue. Cassady Avenue is planned to be widened to a 3-lane section and reconstructed as a complete street with pedestrian and bikeway facilities, lighting, curb and gutter, and closed drainage. The project includes improvements to E. 5th Avenue at the intersection with Cassady Avenue. \n \nOrdinance 0876-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,241,000.00 for final design.  Ordinance 2068-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $141,000.00 to advance utility coordination with AT&T along the corridor of Cassady Avenue in the project limits to reduce the time required for future utility relocations.  Ordinance 2860-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $30,000.00 for designing the storm control practices, utility and railroad coordination, and right of way coordination. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $30,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $30,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $   522,607.64                     (PO098332, Ord. 2680-2017)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,241,000.00                     (PO223483, Ord. 0876-2020)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $   141,000.00                     (PO338646, Ord. 2068-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                                    $     30,000.00                     (PO422070, Ord. 2860-2023)\nThe total of Modification No. 4:                                                                                    $     30,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $1,964,607.64\n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to encumber additional funds for additional effort in designing lighting, coordination with utilities, and services during bidding and construction. The City of Bexley requested changes to the plans within their corporate limits including modifications to the lighting design and curb ramp. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe project has been bid with construction anticipated to begin in spring of 2025. A scope and RFP could not be prepared and fee negotiated to complete the remaining work before the project is under construction.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nSome of the contract modification is to pay for services already provided. The consultant was aware of the sensitivity of this project to delays and made changes as requested and as quickly as possible. The remaining portion of the modification was determined based on anticipated necessary effort to complete the project. This information was used to negotiate a fee for the contract modification. The cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Woolpert, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Woolpert, Inc. is CC001040 and expires 4/17/2025\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $30,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704  within the Department of Public Service.  \n \n4.
