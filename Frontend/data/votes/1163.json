($45,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a yearly agreement with the National Center for Water Quality Research (NCWQR) at Heidelberg University to provide funding for the continued operation of the Tributary Loading Station on the Scioto River at Chillicothe and to calculate the separate contributions of point-source and nonpoint-source loads of phosphorus and other pollutants in the Scioto watershed upstream of these stations.  The first phase of this work was completed during the calendar years of 2014 through 2016.  This second phase of the work is to be done during the calendar years of 2017 through 2021.\n \nThe NCWQR, founded in 1969 by Dr. David B. Baker, is a research organization within the science division of Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio.  The Heidelberg Tributary Loading Program (HTLP) began in 1975, and the Scioto River at Chillicothe has been included in the HTLP since 1996.  Presently there are 16 stations in the HTLP in Ohio and Michigan and in both the Ohio River and Lake Erie basins.  The HTLP is funded by a combination of state and federal agencies, foundations and industries, and all of the resulting data, including those for the Scioto, are publicly available at the tributary download website.\n \nMeasurements of pollutant export from watersheds are used to compare the amounts of pollutants derived from diffuse nonpoint sources, such as agricultural and urban storm runoff, with contributions from point sources, such as publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and industrial facilities.  The two City of Columbus wastewater treatment plants (Southerly and Jackson Pike) are the two largest point source dischargers into the Scioto River watershed.  Accordingly, collecting pollutant monitoring data in the Scioto watershed to enable the comparison of Columbus discharges with other pollutant sources is of significant interest to the City.  \n \nAt the request of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, the NCWQR will operate the Chillicothe monitoring station, obtain the best available data on point source loads to the Scioto River upstream of the monitoring station and will compute the proportional contributions of point-source and non-point source loads of total phosphorus and other pollutants of interest to the Division.  The information will then be included in the interpretive summary.  In addition, the NCWQR will analyze a subset of samples collected at the Chillicothe station during both base flow and storm runoff events, as coordinated with Division of Sewerage and Drainage personnel, for total dissolved solids, alkalinity and hardness.  The NCWQR will also perform a solid comparison study at the Chillicothe station and provide guidance to the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and EPA.\n \nThe work for the second phase of these services will be performed during calendar years 2017 through 2021.  It will continue as an annual ongoing contract.  The cost estimate of the contract is $45,000 for calendar year 2021 as a not-to-exceed amount.  Funding requested for 2021 and any future years will be based upon budgeted funds and approval by City Council.\n    \nSUPPLIER:  Heidelberg University (FID #34-4428219) (DAX #006982), Expires March

Department of Public Utilities has a need to enter into a support agreement with Heidelberg University for the purpose of providing funding and continued support to the National Center for Water Quality Research (NCWQR), for the operation of a Tributary Loading Station on the Scioto River at Chillicothe in 2021 and to calculate the separate contributions of point-source and nonpoint-source loads of phosphorus in the Scioto watershed upstream of this station, and\n \nWHEREAS, the NCWQR, is a research organization within the science division of Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio,

City Council, and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Heidelberg University for the purpose of providing funding and continued support to the National Center for Water Quality Research, for Phase 2 work for the operation of a Tributary Loading Station on the Scioto River and Computation of Point-Source and Nonpoint-Source Loads for 2021; now, therefore \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to enter into a support agreement with Heidelberg University, 310 East Market Street, Tiffin, Ohio

River and Computation of Point-Source and Nonpoint-Source Loads for 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $45,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 6100 Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund in object class 03 Services per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.
