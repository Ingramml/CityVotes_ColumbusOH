    "title": "To amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into agreements with RailPros Field Services, Inc. relative to the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road project; to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation seeks to authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into a reimbursement agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, with RailPros Field Services, Inc. and to encumber and expend funds to compensate the same for services performed during the preliminary engineering phase of the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road project. \nThe aforementioned effort encompasses various improvements to Refugee and Hines road, including widening of the north and west approaches to that intersection to accommodate dedicated southbound right- and left-turn lanes on Hines Road and eastbound and westbound through lanes and an eastbound left-turn lane on Refugee Road. A new railroad-coordinated traffic signal also will be installed at that intersection.  \nGiven that a portion of the planned improvements will cross or be located in close proximity to existing railroad tracks currently operated by Kanawha River Railroad, L.L.C., a subsidiary of Watco Companies LLC, it is necessary that certain services be performed either by the railroad or a consultant it designates in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors. The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the execution of a reimbursement agreement between the Department of Public Service and RailPros Fields Services, pursuant to which the latter will perform a thorough plan review on behalf of the railroad.\n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for RailPros Field Services, Inc. is CC040006.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $100,000.00 is available for this project in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within the Department of Public Service. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to provide sufficient cash and budget authority for the requisite expenditure.\n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the completion of the required plan review by RailPros Field Services as soon as possible so as not to delay the performance of a separate state-mandated diagnostic review by the Ohio Rail Development Commission, which currently is scheduled to commence on or about May 13, 2025. \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into agreements with RailPros Field Services, Inc. relative to the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road project; to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is administering the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road project, which will culminate in the widening of Refugee and Hines roads to accommodate dedicated turn lanes and additional through lanes; and \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned effort requires the consent and cooperation of the Kanawha River Railroad, L.L.C., a subsidiary of Watco Companies LLC, as a portion of the planned improvements will cross or be located in close proximity to existing Kanawha River railroad tracks; and\nWHEREAS, a thorough plan review must be performed by or on behalf of Kanawha River Railroad in order to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors; and \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the execution of a reimbursement agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, between the Department of Public Service and RailPros Field Services, Inc., the designated consultant for Kanawha River Railroad, and the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $100,000.00 to compensate RailPros Field Services for services rendered in connection with the Intersection Improvement - Refugee Road at Hines Road project; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget to provide sufficient budget authority for the expenditure; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, for the project; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this legislation to facilitate the completion of the required plan review by RailPros Field Services as soon as possible so as not to delay the performance of a separate state-mandated diagnostic review by the Ohio Rail Development Commission, which currently is scheduled to commence on or about May 13, 2025, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
