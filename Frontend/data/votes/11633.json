    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with 2LMN, Inc. for Turnberry Golf Course Bridge and Stream Restoration Project. The contract amount is $419,865.64, with a contingency of $94,598.19, for a total of $514,463.83. \n \nThe Turnberry Golf Course, bordering Blacklick Creek, is an Arthur Hills designed links-style championship course. It hosts many local youth tournaments, provides learning opportunities for all ages, and is open to the public.\nThis project will relocate the cart path and new bridge downstream to a straighter segment of Blacklick Creek to prevent future damage. It will also lessen the slope of the cart path from the clubhouse to the driving range and course, addressing safety issues that currently exist.\nDue to the increased frequency and intensity of flood activity on Blacklick Creek, significant stream bank erosion has occurred in the areas adjacent to the existing bridge. In 2023, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department funded temporary stabilization of the bridge and stream bank. Relocating the bridge downstream and restoring about 350 feet of Blacklick Creek will significantly reduce the chances of a future failure. This bridge is critical to the operations of Turnberry Golf Course as it is the only access to the course from the clubhouse and parking lot. \nThe current ramp from the clubhouse to the driving range has greater than a 20% slope and requires sharp turns to navigate, causing accidents. This situation creates dangerous situations for cart drivers as well as golfers on the driving range. With relocation of the Blacklick Creek crossing and adjacent cart path realignment, the ramp will be reworked to safer grades that provide a more accessible experience to users. \nColumbus Recreation and Parks has master planned improvements to Turnberry Golf Course into three phases. Phase one includes the bridge, stream and cart ramp. Phase two is for a three seasons shelter and lower plaza. Phase three involves the clubhouse, parking lot, and upper plaza.\nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Proposals were advertised to firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RSFQ) process, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on October 22, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 19, 2024.
