    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio, Inc. (MHA) by extending the contract period by one-year, for a new contract period of April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026.  The underlying contract was authorized by Ordinance No. 0509-2004 with an original contract term from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025.\n \nExtension of the contract period is needed to ensure that the remaining balance of the current contract is utilized to fund existing intervention activities being facilitated by MHA and carried out by the One Block at a Time program (OBAT).\n \nOBAT is a micro community intervention aimed at increasing the health and wellness of one block in the Linden area. OBAT requires a fiscal agent for this program due to the nature of the interventions, including meeting emergent needs for residents, purchasing and providing items and food for block events, supporting home repairs and physical improvements, gift cards, and other program incidentals.\n \nMental Health America of Ohio, Inc. is a nonprofit entity and is exempt from contract compliance certification.\n \nEmergency action is being requested in order to avoid a gap in this critical service and to meet the ongoing demands of the intervention activities provided by the Columbus Public Health One Block at a Time program within the Linden community.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No new expenditures are being obligated by this ordinance.
