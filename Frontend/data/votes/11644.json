    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with Franklin County for the receipt of wireless 9-1-1 Government Assistance Funds; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Department of Public Safety entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement with Franklin County for the receipt of wireless 9-1-1 Government Assistance Funds as authorized by Ordinance 0042-2010 in January 2010.  The wireless 9-1-1 fund was established due to the State of Ohio passing SB 361 which enacted a service charge of 28 cents per month for each wireless telephone number in the State of Ohio.  Therefore, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 307.15, this ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to renew an Intergovernmental Agreement between the City of Columbus and Franklin County concerning wireless 9-1-1 Funds (Governmental Assistance Funds).  Franklin County is responsible for the distribution of the Wireless 9-1-1 Government Assistance Funds received from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and from the Ohio Department of Taxation beginning January 1, 2020.\n \nOhio Revised Code Section 128.57 allows for the continuation of a monthly fee billed to each wireless telephone number in the State of Ohio. The wireless service providers are required to bill for, collect, and remit the charges to the state which, in turn, distributes the proceeds to the eighty-eight counties in Ohio.  The proceeds are disbursed to various jurisdictions based on the number of wireless service subscribers in the county.  The funds are to pay for the subdivision's equipment and personnel costs of the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) providing the wireless enhanced 9-1-1 system, including call taking and dispatching operations. The City of Columbus is one of five PSAP agencies to receive funds from the proceeds in Franklin County. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   The City of Columbus is the largest PSAP in Franklin County by population and by virtue of receiving approximately three quarters of all wireless 9-1-1 calls.  The funds will be used to partially pay personnel costs of those employees engaged in wireless 9-1-1 call taking and dispatching operations.  The city has received between $1.5 million and $1.98 million annually since 2014, and anticipates receiving approximately $1.8 million in 2025.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is necessary to ensure there is no lapse in the receipt of these critical funds.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with Franklin County for the receipt of wireless 9-1-1 Government Assistance Funds; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is a recipient of monies from Franklin County for the 9-1-1 Governmental Assistance Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, the County and the City desire to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement for the receipt of those funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual and daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with Franklin County for the wireless 9-1-1 Government Assistance Funds and receive the disbursement of funds in the shortest possible time, to ensure there is no lapse in the receipt of these critical funds, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with Franklin County in order to accept the wireless 9-1-1 Government Assistance Funds. \n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
