    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. for the Laboratory Upgrades project, CIP #690554-100000, in an amount up to $357,000.00.\n \nThe current laboratory spaces at the 910 Dublin Road Water Quality Assurance Lab (WQAL), the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP), and the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) are more than 20 years old and are in need of upgrades to meet current laboratory, ergonomic, and architectural guidelines and standards. The work under the original contract completed the evaluation and preliminary design report for the upgrades to the Water Quality Assurance Lab, Dublin Road Water Plant Lab and Parsons Avenue Water Plant Lab.    \n \nThe first planned contract modification provided funding for the detailed design and permitting for construction of the Water Quality Assurance Lab renovations including: new countertops and casework; sinks and fixtures; lighting; and laboratory systems such as fume hoods, refrigeration and DI water systems and design of a Lab Information Management System (LIMS).\n \nThe second planned contract modification provided funding for the engineering services during construction of the Water Quality Assurance Lab renovations as well as the detailed design of the Dublin Road Water Plant lab upgrade including new flooring; lighting; countertops and casework; sinks and fixtures; and laboratory systems.\n \nThe third planned contract modification provided funding for the detailed design of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) lab upgrades and the engineering services during construction for the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP) lab upgrades.\n \nThis planned contract modification (modification #4) will provide funding for the engineering services during construction of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) which was designed under Modification #3 of this contract.  This is the last planned modification for this contract.\n \nThe planning area is 99 Citywide since these facilities serve the entire service area.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:\nThe original agreement did not establish a total term for all planned modifications.  The start of each planned modification was/is contingent upon the progress and anticipated completion of the previous phase and contract.  The original agreement established the first phase of the project for the evaluation of the facilities and preparation of the Preliminary Design Report. \n \nThis modification is the fourth of four planned modifications of the contract.  The planned term for each modification thus far has been approximately 12-24 months.  \n \nThe expiration date is estimated to occur October 2026, but will be contingent upon the construction duration of the PAWP Laboratory Renovation project.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $357,000.00\nOriginal (PO 078201; ORD 1802-2017):                                                                                                             $668,000.00\nModification #1 (PO188775; ORD 1760-2019):                                                       $1,560,000.00\nModification #2 (PO284056 & PO284058, ORD 1500-2021):                                 $2,064,500.00\nModification #3 (PO403831; ORD 1959-2023):                                                          $809,250.00\nModification #4 (Current):                                                                                                               $357,000.00\nTotal                                                                                                                                                                                  $5,458,750.00 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared a detailed scope of work.  Proposed pricing was based upon current contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  Negotiations between CH2M Hill Engineers, Inc. (Jacobs) and the City of Columbus took place to identify the scope and fee necessary to perform the services during construction phase of the PAWP Lab.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project is necessary to bring the facilities up to current code compliance standards for the Water Quality Assurance Lab, the Dublin Road Water Plant Lab and the Parsons Ave. Water Plant Lab.  These facilities are all essential and integral components in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water is essential to economic growth and development.\n \nPublic informational meetings are not anticipated for this project, all proposed work is within the secure boundaries of the water quality assurance lab or the water treatment facilities.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nCH2M’s contract compliance number is CC006247 and expires 2/22/25.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 10.78%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Ch2M Hill Engineers has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nPRIME AE Group, Inc.                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE*\nResource International                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \n* PRIME AE Group is currently certified as a Majority by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  They were certified by ODI as an MBE at the time this contract was implemented and is to be counted as MBE spend throughout the term of the contract.\n \nThe certification of Ch2M Hill Engineers and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
