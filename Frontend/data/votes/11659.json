    "description": "...Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a waterline easement described and recorded in Official Record 34809H11, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”). The Easement burdens real property located in the vicinity of 1905 Jetway Blvd., Columbus Ohio 43219 {Franklin County Tax Parcel 010-255956} (“Servient Estate”) currently owned by Jetway Flex, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company. The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed a request by the owner of the Servient Estate to vacate a 0.457 acre, more or less, portion of the existing Easement and determined that the portion of the Easement is no longer needed as a water main was not installed and the easement is no longer necessary. DPU has determined that terminating the City’s rights to the portion of the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \n...Title\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release a portion the City’s waterline easement rights described and recorded in Official Record 34809H11, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
