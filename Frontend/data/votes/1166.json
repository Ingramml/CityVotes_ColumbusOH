    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an engineering agreement with E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc., for professional engineering services for the Petzinger Road Stormwater Improvements project for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section.  ($59,114.34)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (Mod #3) the professional engineering services agreement with E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc. for the Petzinger Road StormWater Improvements project (CIP 610739-100000), in an amount up to $59,114.34.  \n \nWhile designing this project it was discovered that septic systems were present at eleven (11) of the properties that were to be serviced by the new storm sewer. Construction of the proposed storm sewer improvements was delayed until sanitary sewer service could be extended to the project area and the impacted properties were able to connect to the new sanitary sewer. As a result, a separate sanitary sewer project was developed, designed, and constructed to enable the abandonment of the existing septic systems. Construction for the sanitary sewer project was completed in 2019. The Health Department is currently overseeing the septic system abandonments and private property connections to the new sanitary sewer.\nAs the plans for the storm sewer improvements were completed and signed in 2006, it is necessary to revisit the plans and bring them up to current design standards while also updating the basemapping with pertinent information that was discovered during construction of the sanitary sewer project.\nPlanning Area is 57 (Mid East).\n \n                      Amount of additional funds to be expended: $59,114.34\n                     Original Contract (EL003339)                     $    58,923.58\n                     Modification #1 (EL005393)                                          $    45,055.00\n                     Modification #2 (EL015993)                                          $    31,640.06           \n                     Modification #3 (current)                                          $    59,114.34\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                          $  194,732.98\n \nReasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThe original contract did not anticipate the need for a sanitary sewer extension project, which would need to be designed and constructed, along with the completion of private property connections, prior to being permissible to construct. Once the sanitary sewer issues came to light, it was anticipated that plan revisions to the storm sewer improvements project would be necessary prior to bidding as a significant amount of time would pass between plan signatures and the installation of the sanitary sewer extension. \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe design professional has already completed the original design and plan set, along with the design and as-built information for the sanitary sewer extension project. They are familiar with the nuances of the project area and the design requirements. Bidding of the contract modification would push completion of the project even further and residents are eager to see this work completed.\n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc., which has been reviewed and confirmed by the Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD)/Stormwater Section. \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER: 31-1194974 / MAJ/ Exp. 5/5/23 Vendor No. 4823\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time. \n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: This project has eliminated septic systems that can fail, thereby polluting streams and rivers.  Also, converting from a septic system to sanitary sewer service has a positive impact to property values. With the next phase of this project, a new storm sewer system will be installed to address flooding issues within the project area. The community is aware of this project, and the City has worked closely with the residents to ensure that the sewer alignment and construction will have as minimal an impact as possible\nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes an expenditure of up to $59,114.34 from the Storm Sewer Bond Fund 6204.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an engineering agreement with E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc., for professional engineering services for the Petzinger Road Stormwater Improvements project for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section.  ($59,114.34)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section wishes to modify and increase EL003339 with E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc. for the Petzinger Road Stormwater Improvements project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to authorize an expenditure of up to $59,114.34 from the Storm Sewer Bond Fund 6204; and  \n \nWHEREAS, this Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the City Code pertaining to contract modifications, and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the current contract for the Petzinger Road Stormwater Improvements project with E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc.; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify and increase a professional engineering services agreement with E.P.
