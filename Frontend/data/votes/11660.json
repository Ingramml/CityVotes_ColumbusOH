    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify to add additional funding to rental agreements with Premier Truck Sales & Rental, Inc. in the amount of up to $250,000.00 for the rental of refuse collection trucks to be used by the Division of Refuse Collection. The current rental agreement expires November 18th, 2025, however, due to the urgent need for the continuation to rent trucks, this agreement needs to be modified immediately to include additional funds. \n \nThe Division of Refuse Collection (Division) is responsible for providing weekly refuse collection service to over 358,000 residential units within the City of Columbus.  It is necessary to immediately rent refuse collection trucks to continue to provide timely refuse collection to the residents of Columbus.  This will also allow the Division to be able to collect refuse during the normal work week hours and to avoid routinely scheduling mandatory overtime.  The rental of these vehicles is expected to be needed through July 2025, possibly longer, in order to give time for the trucks that have been on order, and for the trucks that are about to be ordered, to be delivered to the City.  An assessment of delivery times of the vehicles on order will be made in the Summer of 2025.  At that time, it may be necessary to rent additional trucks to accommodate further deficiencies in the Division fleet due to the ongoing pandemic-related production delays or to turn in some of the rentals pending delivery of vehicles on order.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery List (State) produced no findings against Premier Truck Sales & Rental, Inc.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $250,000.00\n \nThe original contract amount:                            $492,000.00               (PO354714, Ord. 2788-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                     $1,000,000.00               (PO415764, Ord. 2742-2023) \nThe total of Modification No. 2:                        $800,000.00               (PO460316, Ord. 1832-2024)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                        $250,000.00               (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all mods:    $2,542,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nPrior to the COVID pandemic it took nine to twelve months after placement of an order to receive a refuse collection truck.  The shutdown of many businesses during the pandemic and supply chain issues have caused long delivery delays for these trucks.  The projected delivery date of replacement trucks previously on order has been delayed by years.  The Division is experiencing a shortage of refuse collection trucks due to downtime needed for repairs of an aging fleet and the delays in getting replacement vehicles that have been ordered.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nA search was made for companies that rented refuse collection trucks.  Two companies were found within Ohio that rented the trucks.  Of the two companies, Premier Truck Sales and Rental was the only company that had trucks available for rent at this time.  The delay associated with the pandemic in getting delivery of new vehicles has caused a shortage of rental vehicles.  Taking the time required to do a formal bidding process could result in these vehicles no longer being available and delays in the collection of refuse. \n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification and extension is consistent with rates that were established in the original contract including increases related to the 2024 model years of the new rentals.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nPremier Truck Sales & Rental, Inc.'s contract compliance number is CC-040372 and expires 12/8/2025. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is budgeted and available from the General Fund, Fund 1000.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is for the rental of refuse trucks.  The purchase and rental of specialized equipment is exempt from this program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure the timely collection of refuse is not interrupted.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify to add additional funding to rental agreements to rent refuse collection trucks from Premier Truck Sales & Rental, Inc.; to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the General Fund to pay for the contract modification that will add additional funding to said rental agreements; and to declare an emergency.  ($250,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection, is responsible for providing weekly refuse collection service to over 358,000 residential units within the City of Columbus;
