    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Franklin County Public Health (FCPH), in an amount up to $90,000.00 to provide a safe temporary housing option to the families of Life at Edgewater Landing when the property was vacated due to landlord negligence, and to authorize the payment of tenant coordination and hotel expenses starting January 13, 2025.  This ordinance also seeks authorization to renew this not-for-profit service contract for one additional year beyond the date of execution, if needed.\n \nOn January 14, 2025, the property manager and owner of the apartment complex, Life at Edgewater Landing was served with a vacate notice for all occupied units without heat due to a failing boiler system. Property management failed to offer a temporary housing option for the displaced families per City Code section 4509.061. The City of Columbus immediately stepped in to offer accommodations to the 53 households that were vacated in the following days. The Vacant Tenant Services program enrolls each family, connecting them with a Columbus Public Health social worker and coordinating with a not for profit partner to identify hotel accommodations and manage the stay.\n \nGiven the scale of this vacate, the Department of Development quickly exhausted the capacity of our two current partner organizations- Homes for Families and COMPASS. Development contacted Franklin County Public Health to assist with emergency placement of households under their existing contracts with hotels. FCPH agreed and has been placing families on our behalf since January 16, 2025. \n \nThe City Attorney has filed a lawsuit against the property ownership due to the ongoing issues and to recoup the City’s expenses incurred to serve the vacated families.  The purpose of this contract is to reimburse FCPH for the costs that they are incurring as one of our partner agencies.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available in the Administrative Division’s 2025 General Fund budget, contingent on the passage of the 2025 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3035-2024. \n \nContract Compliance: the vendor number is 006183 and expires 10/17/2025.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Franklin County Public Health to provide a safe temporary housing option to the families of Life at Edgewater Landing; to authorize the expenditure of up to $90,000.00; and to authorize payment of expenses incurred by Franklin County Public Health starting January 13, 2025 and to provide an option to renew the contract for one additional year from the date of execution. ($90,000.00)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Franklin County Public Health to provide a safe temporary housing option to the families of Life at Edgewater Landing when the property was vacated due to landlord negligence, and to authorize the payment of expenses starting January 13, 2025 with an option to renew for one additional year; and\n \nWHEREAS, that the expenditure of up to $90,000.00 from the General Fund is authorized, contingent upon the passage of the 2025 Operating Budget; and\n \nWHEREAS, on January 14, 2025, the property manager and owner of the apartment complex, Life at Edgewater Landing was served with a vacate notice for all occupied units without heat due to a failing boiler system; and\n \nWHEREAS, property management failed to offer a temporary housing option for the displaced families per City Code section 4509.061 and the City of Columbus immediately stepped in to offer accommodations to the 53 households; and\n \nWHEREAS, given the scale of this vacate, the Department of Development quickly exhausted the capacity of our two current partner organizations- Homes for Families and COMPASS; and\n \nWHEREAS, Development contacted Franklin County Public Health to assist with emergency placement of households under their existing contracts with hotels; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Franklin County Public Health to provide a safe temporary housing option to the families of Life at Edgewater Landing; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Franklin County Public Health to provide a safe temporary housing option to the families of Life at Edgewater Landing in an amount up to $90,000.00 and is authorized to make payment for expenses incurred by Franklin County Public Health starting January 13, 2025 with an option to renew for one additional year from the date of execution. \n   \nSECTION 2.  That for the purpose as stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $90,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-01 (Administration), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this contract is awarded pursuant to the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to not-for-profit service contracts.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
