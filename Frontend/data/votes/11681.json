    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Technology to enter into a contract with Vertiv Corporation for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) maintenance and repair services. The city originally entered into contract for these services in 2006 via Ordinance 1160-2006. At that time, the company was known as Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Inc. However, in April of 2017, the company formally changed its name to Vertiv Services, Inc. As such, all subsequent legislation authorized contracts with Vertiv. The most recent ordinance for the above-described services was 0427-2024, passed on March 4, 2024. \n \nAs a result of various system and equipment issues at the city’s data center, the Department of Technology has selected one comprehensive vendor with the expertise to manage all equipment under one contract. Previously there were five separate vendors/contractors performing routine maintenance and support services which was not cost effective or efficient, as many systems are interconnected. As such, this ordinance requests the waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nAdditionally, this ordinance authorizes contingency funding in the amount of $60,000.00 for unforeseen circumstances, replacement parts, and maintenance services. The term of this contract will be for one year, beginning on April 19, 2025, and ending on April 18, 2026, at a total cost of $243,844.01.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this ordinance are budgeted and available in the 2025 Department of Technology’s Information Services Operating Fund. This ordinance is contingent upon passage of the 2025 Operating budget, Ordinance no. 3036-2024.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVertiv Corporation\n#025728, Expiring 3/31/2025\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Vertiv Corporation for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, and uninterrupted power supply maintenance and repair services; to authorize the waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to authorize the expenditure of $243,844.01. ($243,844.01)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, there is a need for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, and uninterrupted power supply maintenance and repair services at the city’s data centers; and\nWHEREAS, given the critical need for reliable HVAC and UPS systems at the city's data centers, it is in the city's best interests to enter into one comprehensive contract with Vertiv Corporation and authorize the waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of Section 329 of Columbus City Codes; and\nWHEREAS, the term of this contract will be for one year, beginning on April 19, 2025, and ending on April 18, 2026, at a total cost of $243,844.01; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is contingent upon passage of the 2025 Operating budget, Ordinance no. 3036-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract Vertiv Corporation for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning and uninterrupted power supply maintenance and repair services at the city’s data centers for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety, NOW THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
