    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to contract with OnActuate Consulting US Inc. for professional services to support, maintain, and enhance the City’s financial system, Dynamics 365 Finance (D365). It also authorizes the expenditure of $675,000.00 for maintenance and support services and $450,000.00 from the Auditor Bond Fund for software capability enhancements, for a total of $1,125,000.00.\nD365, developed by Microsoft, has served as the City’s financial system since January 1, 2021, supporting essential functions such as accounting, accounts payable/receivable, budgeting, cashiering, fixed assets, procurement, sealed bidding, and vendor management. It also serves as the primary data source for the City’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) and debt issuance reports. Keeping this system fully operational, current, updated, and adaptable to evolving needs is critical to City operations.\nOnActuate Consulting US Inc. will act as the City's designated Microsoft partner, filing support cases and assisting City staff with Dynamics updates, fixes, and feature applications. They will also provide consulting and technical expertise for the Auditor’s cloud environment in Azure, Point of Sale extensions, and Power Platform development with authorized access to the City’s environments, DevOps, and Visual Studio subscriptions. The City lacks the in-house staffing and expertise to manage these services or develop new system functionalities using Dynamics 365, Azure, and Power platform tools. These tools enable developers to extend system functionality, adjust the user interface, and implement custom business logic without altering the core application code. Having Microsoft certified and platform experienced professionals is essential for maintaining operational readiness and enhancing this critical system’s capabilities.\nTo procure these services, the City Auditor’s Office issued Request for Proposals (RFP#RFQ027970) in accordance with Columbus City Code Section 329.28. The RFP, released on October 28, 2024, sought proposals for professional managed support and consulting services for D365, Point of Sale (POS), Azure, and Power Platform. The contract includes a minimum of 2.25 FTEs for annual managed support, as well as capital-funded projects to extend D365, POS, and Power Platform capabilities on a time and materials basis at contract defined and discounted rates. The RFP was advertised in the City Bulletin, posted on the City’s Vendor Services website, and directly sent to registered vendors specializing in finance and accounting software.\nA total of 510 vendors were solicited in the following Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI) classifications as follows: \n\n\n\nODI Certification\n\nCount of Solicited Vendors\n\n\n\nEBE\n\n15\n\n\n\nMBE\n\n16\n\n\n\nVBE\n\n2\n\n\n\nWBE\n\n10\n\n\n\nMAJORITY/Publicly held\n\n467\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n510\n\n\n \nA total of thirteen (13) responses were received by the proposal submission deadline of December 6, 2024, to the specified electronic destination in the Bonfire application.
