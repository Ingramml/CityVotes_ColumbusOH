    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of Franklin County Municipal Court, Clerk of Court (“Municipal Court Clerk”) to enter into a one (1) year contract with 3SG Plus LLC (“3SG”) for the provision of professional services for the OnBase software upgrade (“OnBase upgrade”) in the amount of $70,000.00 for the Franklin County Municipal Court Case Imaging System. \n \nThe upgrade will take our OnBase environments from version 20.3.15.1000 to the latest OnBase Foundation version. This upgrade will eliminate unnecessary support fees and maintain optimal support for the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office.\nThe imaging system converts the existing court documents into electronic images necessary to optimize storage space and reduce future storage costs, while providing for more efficient access to court document information. \n \nBid Information: \nOrdinance No. 0582-87 authorizes the City of Columbus to purchase from cooperative purchasing contracts which are not bid but negotiated contracts. \n \n3SG Corporation, a dealer of Hyland Software, Inc. installed and configured the Hyland OnBase software for the Municipal Court Clerk imaging system. 3SG Plus LLC is currently providing the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office with software maintenance services and will continue to provide this service through the State of Ohio, State Term Schedule (“STS”) # 533272-3-6: expiration date 3/31/2026. Hyland requires all respondents to offer the same maintenance pricing of the Ohio State Term contract.\n \nTherefore, this legislation waives the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code, Chapter 329 to contract with 3SG Corporation. It is in the best interest of the City to waive competitive bidding, for the continuity of the software maintenance and to facilitate an OnBase upgrade to eliminate the need for extended support fees in the foreseeable future and avoid unnecessary costs and maintain optimal support for the Municipal Court Clerk’s operations.\n \nContracts: \nPO478127: 31,535.44\nP0415871: 40,475.21\nOrdinance: 1678-2005\nOrdinance: 0717-2010\n \nContract Compliance Number: 46-5504877\n3SG Plus, LLC\nExpiration date: 10/31/2025\nVendor # 019867 \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to facilitate the OnBase upgrade. \nFiscal Impact Funds totaling $70,000.00 are available in the Municipal Court Clerk Computer Fund. This upgrade will help to avoid unnecessary costs and maintain optimal support for the Municipal Court Clerk’s operations.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Municipal Court Clerk, to enter in a contract with 3SG for the provision of the software upgrade; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City code; to authorize an expenditure of $70,000.00 from the Municipal Court Clerk Computer Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($70,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Municipal Court Clerk, to enter in the contract with 3SG for the provision of the software upgrade for the Franklin County Municipal Court imaging system; and\n \nWHEREAS, the imaging system converts the existing court documents into electronic images necessary to optimize storage space and reduce future storage costs, while providing for more efficient access to court document information; and\n \nWHEREAS, this upgrade will help to avoid unnecessary costs and maintain optimal support for the Municipal Court Clerk’s operations; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter in the contract with 3SG for the OnBase upgrade for the imaging system to optimize storage space and reduce future storage costs, while providing for more efficient access to court document information, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Municipal Court Clerk, be and is hereby authorized to enter the contract with 3SG for the provision of the software OnBase upgrade for the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in the amount of $70,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2.
