    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Elford, Inc., via the City’s Invitation For Bid process, for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) - Control Room and Laboratory Renovations, CIP No. 690291-100009, in an amount up to $2,826,985.00, and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for Bacon Davis prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $2,828,985.00.\n \nWork consists of renovations and commissioning of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant Control Room and Laboratory including, but not limited to, lighting, electrical systems, countertops, casework, sinks and fixtures, and other laboratory systems such as refrigeration, fume hoods, and DI water systems, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract, in accordance with the drawings, technical specifications, special provisions, and City of Columbus Construction and Material specifications set forth in this Invitation For Bid (IFB).\n \nThis project is located within the following Community Planning Area: Citywide (99)\n \nTIMELINE:  \nAll work shall be substantially complete within 450 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed, with the Final Completion to occur within 480 calendar days.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed in 2nd quarter 2025.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nThe bid amount and proposed award amount is $2,826,985.00, includes a 15% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                                                        $   2,826,985.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                               $               0.00\n        CONTRACT TOTAL                                               $   2,826,985.00\nDavis Bacon (PW) Charges                                               $         2,000.00\n        TOTAL LEGISLATION:                                               $   2,828,985.00 \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe control room and laboratory of the PAWP do not meet functional or ergonomic needs associated with current design practices for layouts, lighting, and modern operator interface equipment.  The PAWP control room is the primary location where plant staff monitor and control the water treatment process.  The instrumentation and controls housed in the control room are vital to the treatment and supply of safe drinking water to the Columbus and the Central Ohio area.  The laboratory is an essential part of the plant that monitors water quality throughout the treatment process and ensures regulatory compliance. Safe, compliant water quality and quantity are necessary for community economic growth.\n \nThe majority of the work will occur within areas that are not accessible to the public, so no community outreach is anticipated. \n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) - Control Room and Laboratory Renovations was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from September 26, 2024 through November 6, 2024.  Two bids were received for the project and opened on November 6, 2024.  The following companies submitted bids:\n  \nCompany                                                          Bid Amount                        ODI Status\nElford, Inc.                                                                                    $2,826,985.00                                                               MAJ\nSetterlin Building Co.                                                               $3,554,650.00                                                                MAJ\n \nElford, Inc.'s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $2,826,985.00.  \n \nThe certification of Elford, Inc. was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nElford, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006059 and expires 12/28/25.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Elford, Inc. or their subcontractors. \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 12% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  The MBE/WBE program goal has been met by the use of MBE/WBE subcontractors.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Elford, Inc., has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nAccess Flooring                                                                       Hudson, Ohio                                                             MAJ\nAnderson Decorating                                   Westerville, Ohio                                                                 WBE\nClaypool Electric                                                         Lancaster, Ohio                                                                       WBE\nHina Environmental                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                                  MBE\nImperial HVAC                                                                                              Solon, Ohio                                                                                          UNK\nPummell Construction                                                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                                        WBE\nRadico Inc.                                                 Columbus, Ohio                                                                                        MAJ\nSpencer-Virnoche                                                                          Clay, New York                                                                                         MAJ \nThe Ardit Company                                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                                                                        WBE \nTP Mechanical                                                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                                         MAJ\n \nThe certification of Elford, Inc., and all proposed subcontractors were in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nElford, Inc. and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  The exception is Imperial HVAC which does not have a current, valid contract compliance number and will need to complete the registration process on Vendor Services.  \n \n7.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe instrumentation and controls housed in the control room are vital for the supply of safe drinking water and are beyond their useful life. Emergency designation is requested to expedite the replacement of this aged equipment.  \n \n8.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 0859-2024, passed by Council on April 19, 2024.  The loan is expected to be approved in February, 2025.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application.\nFunds in the amount of $2,000.00 are available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to pay the Department of Public Service to perform construction administration for the project.  These funds are appropriated.  The 2024 Capital Improvement Budget must be modified to align budget authority with the proper project.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Elford, Inc., for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant - Control Room and Laboratory Renovations;
