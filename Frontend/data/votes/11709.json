    "description": "Explanation \n \nThe Columbus Zone In Initiative (“Zone In”), a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and Official Zoning Map, began in 2023 with the “Where Do We Begin” report, which identified that the initial phase of Zone In should focus on 140 miles of key corridors. These “Main Streets” were identified as having the greatest potential to deliver critically needed housing, support enhanced mobility options, and create employment opportunities in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable. The initial locations were based on a number of factors including existing land use and development policy; current base zoning and overlays; existing conditions; proximity to current and planned COTA routes and proposed LinkUS bus rapid transit alignments; and site-specific circumstances.  \n \nPhase One was implemented on July 29, 2024, with City Council rezoning approximately 12,300 parcels into one of the newly created mixed-use districts, and enacting Title 34, the 2024 Zoning Code, which defines the new districts. After having worked with Title 34 for over six months, it has been determined that an update to Phase One consisting of map amendments and minor revisions to the code would be beneficial.  \n \nIn the initial stages of identifying priority corridors to rezone parcels into new mixed-use districts, 62 focus areas emerged as top candidates based on strong alignment with the factors listed above. Certain parcels along or adjacent to State Route 161 (SR-161) were identified as meeting the criteria for the Community Activity Center (CAC) and Regional Activity Center (RAC) districts as defined in Title 34, and therefore, were rezoned as part of Phase One. Other portions of the SR-161 corridor did not initially appear to fit the guidelines for the new districts due to the absence of sidewalks, existing conditions, and the lack of a recommendation for mixed-use development in the previously adopted Northland I Area Plan (2014). \n \nSince the passage of Phase One, portions of SR-161 which include parcels along or adjacent to SR-161 between the Worthington City limits to the west and Ponderosa Drive to the east (the “Northland Community portion”), have been further examined by the Zone In project team. This portion abuts two areas that have been recently rezoned into Title 34 mixed-use districts. In addition, the Northland Community Council, along with other business and civic groups, have recently expressed much support for rezoning these parcels into Title 34 districts.  \n \nThe project team has now determined that the Northland Community portion meets the criteria for placement in the Community Activity Center (CAC) and Urban General (UGN-2) districts as defined in Title 34 based on the following: current base zoning that restricts more housing or walkability; availability of existing COTA routes; development priorities that support the creation of new housing and mixed use development; planned construction of new pedestrian-friendly infrastructure; and under-utilized properties, use limitations, and lack of uniform design standards. Therefore, it is recommended to rezone the parcels in the Northland Community portion into Title 34 mixed-use districts. \n \nPer City Code Section 3310.07, this resolution is needed for City Council to declare its intention to rezone these approximately 165 parcels along the Northland Community portion of the SR-161 corridor from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to Title 34 2024 Zoning Code district designations. \n \nAttached hereto are the maps and a parcel list depicting the parcels that are to be rezoned into mixed use zoning districts along with supporting documentation from neighborhood groups. \n \nThis action initiates a 60-day public review process required by City Code.  During this period, Area Commissions, the Development Commission, or any other applicable reviewing body will be provided with the supporting documentation relating to the Northland Community portion of SR-161 corridor. \n \nMailing of notices to owners and tenants of impacted properties and owners of property within 125 feet of impacted properties will coincide with the review period.  City Council will hold two public meetings during the comment period and may hold an additional meeting at its conclusion to consider comments received prior to any further action.     \n \nSince the adoption of Title 34, background work has continued on future phases of Zone In. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This resolution is requesting emergency action due to the significant interest this initiative has generated, and the need to pursue additional solutions to the housing crisis currently facing Central Ohio.     \n \nTitle \n \nTo declare this Council’s intention to amend the Zoning Map by rezoning certain properties from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to Title 34 2024 Zoning Code district designations, and to declare an emergency.   \n \nBody \n \nWHEREAS, Phase One of the Columbus Zone In Initiative, a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and Official Zoning Map, began in 2023 with a focus on 140 miles of key corridors, with the creation of a modern zoning code that promotes a sustainable, equitable city, through support for housing, small businesses, equity, and connected communities; and    \n \nWHEREAS, in the initial stages of identifying priority mixed-use corridors to be included in Phase One of Zone In, 62 focus areas emerged as top candidates based on strong alignment with certain factors including existing land use and development policy; current base zoning and overlays; existing conditions; proximity to current and planned COTA routes and proposed LinkUS bus rapid transit alignments; and site-specific circumstances; and  \n \nWHEREAS, portions of SR-161 were identified as meeting the criteria for the CAC and RAC districts, as defined by the new Title 34, and, therefore, were included in Phase One, while other portions of the SR-161 corridor did not initially appear to fit the guidelines for the new districts; and  \n \nWHEREAS, since the passage of Phase One, the Northland Community portions of SR-161, which include certain parcels along and adjacent to SR-161 between Worthington City limits to the west and Ponderosa Drive to the east that abut newly rezoned parcels, have been further examined by the Zone In project team, and have received significant support from the business and civic community for rezoning these parcels; and \n \nWHEREAS, the project team has determined that this portion does meet the criteria for the placement in CAC and UGN-2 districts, based on the following: development priorities that support the creation of new housing and mixed use development; current base zoning that restricts these priorities; availability of existing COTA routes; planned construction of new pedestrian friendly infrastructure; and under-utilized properties, use limitations, and lack of uniform design standards; and   \n \nWHEREAS, City Council accepts the attached maps and a parcel list depicting allocation of these parcels into the Title 34 2024 Zoning Code district designations, and intends to amend the Zoning Map to rezone properties as depicted from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to Title 34 2024 Zoning Code district designations; and \n \nWHEREAS, passage of this resolution initiates a 60-day public comment period, during which Area Commissions, the Development Commission, and applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public, will have the opportunity to review and comment on the proposed changes; and  \n \nWHEREAS, City Council will hold two public meetings during the comment period and may hold an additional meeting at its conclusion to review submitted comments prior to any further action; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services and the Department of Development such that it is necessary to immediately state the intention of this Council to resolve to initiate the rezoning of identified parcels because of the significant interest this initiative has generated, and the need to pursue additional solutions to the housing crisis currently facing Central Ohio; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1: That this Council hereby acknowledges receipt of the Zone In Initiative Phase One map update relating to the Northland Community portion of SR 161 corridor, and expresses its intent to amend the Zoning Map by rezoning certain properties from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to Title 34 2024 Zoning Code district designations, all as further described in the parcel list attached to this resolution.  \n \nSECTION 2:  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Resolution is hereby declared to be an emergency measure, and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
