    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background:\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Matthew LaBuhn, Esq, requester and agent for the applicant, Specialty Gas Properties LLC, asking the City to sell an approximate 1,137 square foot portion of right-of-way adjacent to property address 4500 Indianola Avenue and Beaumont Road at the southern terminus, just east of Indianola Avenue.  The portion of right-of-way in question runs north/south directionally and is adjacent to a parcel already owned by the applicant, PID 010-007552.\n \nSale of this right-of-way will serve to enhance access to the Specialty Gas Properties LLC property and incorporate the right-of-way  into the applicant’s current parcel.  Sale will also address the irregular shape of the site and provide more utility for the property which will benefit customers and invitees.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to sell the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $4,548.00 was established.  Mitigation was not requested.  An easement will be retained.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on November 19, 2020.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Specialty Gas House at the cost of $4,548.00 to them.\n \n2.
