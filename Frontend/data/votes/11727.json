    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:\nOn October 3, 2012, the Columbus City Treasurer's Office issued a request for proposal for various banking services.\n \nHuntington National Bank was awarded merchant processing and lockbox services and, as a result, an operating account at Huntington was opened to facilitate the movement of funds to the City’s other, primary bank (Chase).\n \nIn 2021, the City Treasurer’s Office, in collaboration with the City Auditor’s Office and the Department of Finance and Management, began developing a banking RFP with an expansion of the services beyond traditional banking.  JP Morgan Chase was awarded the City’s merchant processing and utilities lockbox accounts, however, the transition between banking partners takes time.\n \nWhile this transition is underway, the City Treasurer’s Office will continue to require an operating account with Huntington National Bank in order to collect funds and move them to the City’s primary bank at JP Morgan Chase.  Huntington has agreed to renew its operating account contract with the City.\n \nThe City Treasurer now, therefore, wishes to extend the term of the agreement with Huntington National Bank for its operating account through May 31, 2026, and to add the necessary funding for the contract.\n \nThe current contract expiration is May 31, 2025, therefore, emergency designation is requested so that the contract does not lapse before the extension takes effect.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nFunding for this ordinance is available within the Treasurer’s Office 2025 budget.\n \nContract Compliance:  Huntington National Bank, 310966785, April 18, 2026\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to extend its contract for banking services with Huntington National Bank; to authorize the expenditure of $7,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
