    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and to provide funding to the City of Bexley relative to the development of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan. \nThe Department of Public Service and the City of Bexley (the “Parties”) are “working jointly… to provide for safe and accessible infrastructure, attractive streetscape, and cooperative development and land use policies in the Livingston Avenue corridor focused on revitalizing the corridor and surrounding neighborhoods of Bexley, Berwick, Eastmoor, and Driving Park”, culminating in the development of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan. That document will reflect a “common vision for improvements to the corridor, bringing renewed value to the area that provides meaningful physical and cultural connectivity, and enhancements to pedestrian, cyclist, motorist, and public safety”. \nThe Parties have engaged NBBJ to perform various urban and transportation planning services necessary to the preparation of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan. The projected cost of said services is $159,000.00, with the Department of Public Service agreeing to pay one-half of that sum. The purpose of this legislation is to enable the Department of Public Service to fulfill that commitment.    \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $79,500.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service to support this project. An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned expenditure.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within Fund 7704 is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to make requisite construction funding available as soon as reasonably practicable so as to enable the Department of Public Service to satisfy the obligation owed to Bexley in a timely manner and to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with, and provide funding to, the City of Bexley relative to the development of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan; to authorize the expenditure of up to $79,500.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($79,500.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service and the City of Bexley (the “Parties”) are “working jointly… to provide for safe and accessible infrastructure, attractive streetscape, and cooperative development and land use policies in the Livingston Avenue corridor focused on revitalizing the corridor and surrounding neighborhoods of Bexley, Berwick, Eastmoor, and Driving Park”; and \n \nWHEREAS, the resulting Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan will reflect a “common vision for improvements to the corridor, bringing renewed value to the area that provides meaningful physical and cultural connectivity, and enhancements to pedestrian, cyclist, motorist, and public safety”; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Bexley recently contracted with NBBJ, a global architecture, planning, and design firm, for the provision of various urban and transportation planning services necessary to the preparation of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan;

and \n \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with, and to contribute funding to, the City of Bexley for costs incurred during the completion of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned project expenditure; and\nWHEREAS, it also is necessary to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects to align cash and appropriation within the correct project; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into the agreement to make requisite construction funding available as soon as reasonably practicable so as to enable the Department of Public Service to satisfy the obligation owed to Bexley in a timely manner and to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the Bexley and Berwick Joint Livingston Avenue Plan, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;
