    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with The Ruhlin Company for the Intersection - East Broad Street at Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road project in an amount up to $47,547.16.\nOrdinance 2466-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with The Ruhlin Company for the construction of the Intersection - East Broad Street at Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.\n \nThe work performed to date for this project consists of curb ramp, sidewalk, and traffic signal replacement, as well as street light construction at the East Broad Street and Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road intersection.\n \nThe work for modification 1 will consist of addition of permanent steel caissons, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $47,547.16\nThe original contract amount, no inspection:                                   $545,309.82     (PO349734, Ord. 2466-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:                 $47,547.16     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $592,856.98  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is an unplanned modification.  It was not anticipated that the proposed strain pole foundations would require permanent steel caissons as a result of groundwater.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nFor this intersection improvement project to upgrade the traffic signal, the new strain pole foundations are a primary component of the proposed work. Performing this work on a separate contract would cost more and have more impact to the public.  It has been determined that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work out.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe requested $47,547.16 will provide the remaining portion of the actual force account cost of $59,925.01 for permanent steel caissons.  The cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against The Ruhlin Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for The Ruhlin Company is CC017759 and expires August 5, 2026.\n \n3.  Pre-Qualification Status\nThe Ruhlin Company and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $47,547.16 is available within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  A transfer of cash is necessary to align spending with the proper project.  It is necessary to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget to establish sufficient budget authority for this project. Funds are appropriated.  \n \n5. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThe original contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in the original contract and did not assign a goal.  The original contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract modification.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with The Ruhlin Company in connection with the Intersection - East Broad Street at Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $47,547.16 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  ($47,547.16) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
