    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to high-quality pre-kindergarten education for every 4-year-old. Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nChildren who participate in high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills. Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate.\n \nIt is crucial that all families in all communities have access to high-quality early education programs. Unfortunately, some families lost access to high-quality early learning when an important early learning provider on Columbus’ South Side ceased their operations. Though a new provider assumed control of the main site on Reeb Avenue, a satellite site at 27 West Jenkins Street was closed.\n \nThe Office of Education requests the authority to enter into a contract with The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) to serve children at the closed West Jenkins Avenue location.\n \nThis contract will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329.30. The Mayor’s Office of Education has neither the capacity nor the expertise to perform this role.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes a transfer from the Department of Development General Fund to the Mayor's Office of Education General Fund, and an expenditure of $100,000.00 from the 2025 Mayor’s Office of Education General Fund budget. ($100,000.00)\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \nEmergency designation is requested to provide operational support to YWCA so that they may begin to serve children as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to enter into a contract The Young Women's Christian Association to provide them operational support at their new site on West Jenkins Avenue; to authorize the transfer of $100,000.00 from the Department of Development (Housing Division) General Fund to the Office of Education; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the Office of Education General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Mayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that all children have access to high-quality early education; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is crucial that all families in all communities have access to high-quality education programs; and \n \nWHEREAS, many Southside families lost access to high-quality early learning programming when their provider ceased their operations; and \n \nWHEREAS, YWCA seeks to reopen the closed site to support those children and families; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Education requests the authority to provide operational support to YWCA; and\n \nWHEREAS, this contract is being awarded to the YWCA pursuant to Section 329.30, for which the City does not supply such services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, a transfer from the Department of Development General Fund to the Office of Education General Fund is necessary to provide funding for this contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with the YWCA to support their new operations as soon as possible to avoid service interruption, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.

That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is herby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or 10 days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
