    "description": "Explanation\n                      \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to modify a contract with Elevate Advocacy LLC by extending the contract.\n \nThe current contract was authorized by Ordinance 0941-2024, which was the second contract between the Office of Education and Elevate Advocacy LLC for program management services associated with the Columbus Promise program. The contract is set to expire on March 31, 2025.\n \nGiven the relationships that Elevate Advocacy has built with key Columbus Promise program partners, it is not in the best interest of the City, the program, or the students served by the Columbus Promise to bid out this contract as that would result in a delay of progress for the program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                                          $65,000.00                                          Ord. 0941-2024                                          \nModification No. 1 amount                                          $         0.00                                          \nTotal contract amount                              $65,000.00\n \nThe Columbus Promise program is a transformational college access, success, and workforce program made possible by a coalition that includes Columbus City Schools, Columbus State Community College, I Know I Can, the Columbus Foundation, the Upjohn Institute, and other partners. Announced in the fall of 2021, the third cohort of students are now enrolled, currently enabling Columbus City Schools students to attend Columbus State Community College. The vision for the Columbus Promise program is an array of free college-to-career pathways for Columbus students.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested due to the impending expiration of the current contract on March 31, 2025. It is essential to the success of the Promise program and to the work of the Office of Education that uninterrupted program management work continue.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to extend a contract with Elevate Advocacy LLC for program management services in support of the Columbus Promise program; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Promise is a transformational college access, success, and workforce program with its third cohort of Columbus City Schools (CCS) students enrolled at Columbus State Community College; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Education has engaged a program manager to provide day-to-day support to the Columbus Promise initiative operations and strategic planning work; and\n \nWHEREAS, Elevate Advocacy LLC has provided excellent ongoing program management support to the Columbus Promise program; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to extend a contract with Elevate Advocacy LLC to avoid a delay in the provision and continuation of program management services for the Columbus Promise program as the current contract is set to expire on March 31, 2025, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Office of Education is hereby authorized extend the contract with Elevate Advocacy LLC for program management services in support of the Columbus Promise program to December 31, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Code Charter 329 relating to contract modifications.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
