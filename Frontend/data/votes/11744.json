    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and transfer of $17,663.24 within the Recreation and Parks Grants Fund to reinvest funds secured by the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging received as part of U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Site-based Program (COAP) grant to support the Specialized Program Assessing Resource Connectivity (SPARC). \nAs of September 2024, the COAAA positions designated for SPARC were transferred to the Division of Fire permanently. From January to September 2024, COAAA utilized grant funding to maintain these positions. With the transition to the Division of Fire, the positions are now primarily funded with the general fund. The funds associated with the COAP grant are no longer needed to support SPARC positions at COAAA. This ordinance authorizes COAAA to reinvest the remaining grant funds to support additional home and community-based services for older adults and people with disabilities in Central Ohio. \nFiscal Impact: \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and transfer of $17,663.24 from the unencumbered cash balance of the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund. A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $17,663.24 from the unencumbered cash balance of the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund for the provision of home and community-based services for older adults in Central Ohio; and to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriations between projects in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.
