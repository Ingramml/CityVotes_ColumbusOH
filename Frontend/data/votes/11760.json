Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year contract for fiscal years 2023 - 2025 for which modifications were anticipated pursuant to the original authorizing legislation under Ordinance 0956-2023 to account for future construction projects being assigned to Stantec Consulting Services Inc. for inspection services.  Those future construction projects were not known when the contract was put into place.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) time frame.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Stantec Consulting Services Inc. and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency and valves that are inoperable.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss.
