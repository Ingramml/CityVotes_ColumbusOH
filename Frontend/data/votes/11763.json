    "description": "...Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Dynotec, INC for the UIRF General Engineering Services contract, C.I.P. #440007-100024, in an amount not to exceed $100,000.00.  \n \nThis contract modification is to provide general engineering design services for Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) street lighting projects, under Capital Improvement Project Number 440007-100024. Service will be authorized on a task order basis as needed. Work performed to-date includes preparing construction plans to install post top lighting on Dakota Avenue and Guilford Street in the Franklinton Area. For contract modification one the consultant will prepare construction plans to install post top style decorative street lighting on Fairwood Avenue from Livingston Avenue to Mooberry Street. \n \nThis modification is the first of two planned contract modifications. The second planned modification is for services during construction.\n \nThe Columbus Community is 62 - Livingston Avenue.\n \n1.1.  UPDATED TIMELINE & FUTURE RENEWALS\nThe original Professional Design Contract completion date was for one year from the Notice to Proceed or when the contract is completed to the satisfaction of the City. The original contract allowed for two modifications to add funding to extend the contract.\n \n1.2.  ESTIMATED CONTRACT COST \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $100,000.00\nCost summary: \n                     Original Contract (PO365269, ORD 3433-2022)                                  $100,000.00\n                     Modification #1 (current)                                                                                                          $100,000.00\n                     Modification #2 (future, estimated)                                                                              $100,000.00 \n                     ESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                     $300,000.00\n \n1.3.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4.  How cost of modification was determined:\nDynotec, INC provided a cost proposal as requested by the City based on the current contract rates for job titles, allowable expenses, and overhead. The fee proposal was reviewed by the Division of Power and deemed to be acceptable.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis contract will design street lighting improvements in areas identified by the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Program.  Replacing old High Pressure Sodium (HPS) fixtures with LED technology will generate savings in electric energy, reduce greenhouse gases and long-term maintenance.  Additionally, the replacement of aging HPS luminaries with new LED fixtures will provide greater light output and better color rendering.  This will help pedestrians and motorists better identify objects at night. Street lighting has many benefits including improving traffic and pedestrian safety, and providing residents a better sense of safety and security. This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \n3.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nDynotec, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC005053 and expires 02/12/2026.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was awarded with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as approved by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  The consultant is required to meet this goal including all contract modifications.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the contract.\n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $100,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to add funding for the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund General Engineering Services contract with Dynotec, INC; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Electricity Bond Fund for the contract modification.  ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in capital improvement projects for the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Program; and \n \nWHEREAS, the UIRF General Engineering Services contract, CIP #440007-100024, was initiated to assist the Department with designing some of these capital improvement projects; and \n \nWHEREAS, Dynotec, INC was awarded the UIRF General Engineering Services contract through the City’s Request for Proposal process; and \n \nWHEREAS, the UIRF General Engineering Services contract was established with the intention of doing periodic contract modifications to add funding; and \n \nWHEREAS, a contract modification to add funding is necessary to continue the services provided by this contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget must be modified to align budget authority with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract modification with Dynotec, INC for the UIRF General Engineering Services contract to add funding to the contract for continued services; and \n \nWHEREAS, funds must be expended to pay for the services Dynotec will provide under the UIRF General Engineering Services contract; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget authorized by Ordinance 1907-2024 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority/ Revised Authority / Change \n6303 / P440007-100000 / UIRF Funded Street Lights (Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund) (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $1,240,262.00 / $1,140,262.00 / ($100,000.00)\n \n6303 / P440007-100024 / UIRF General Engineering (2022-2024) (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $0.00/ $100,000.00 / $100,000.00\n \nSECTION 2.
