    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Sewers and Drains (DOSD) has a ½ Cubic Yard Single Line Clamshell Bucket that is no longer needed. The Bucket is operational; however, DOSD wishes to donate it to the City of Louisville, KY, to aid in bringing their deep-shaft systems online. DOSD does not foresee a future need or use for this Clamshell bucket.\n \nThis ordinance requests a waiver of requirements in Chapter 329 of City Code for the sale of City-owned personal property. The waiver authorized by 329.15 will bypass requirements to offer the assets to other City agencies and a bidding process, thus expediting Louisville’s ability to utilize this equipment.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNo funds are required.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those documents necessary to transfer ownership of a ½ Cubic Yard Single Line Clamshell Bucket to the City of Louisville, KY to aid in bringing their deep-shaft systems online.
