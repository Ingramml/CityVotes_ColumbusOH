    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with i3 Milestone, LLC. for Customer Self-Service Portal Solution and Implementation services.\n \nThe i3 Milestone ePortal has been selected as part of the customer cloud service and Integrated Systems Upgrade Project. This portal is a new self-service software solution that will help support the Department of Public Utilities and its customers. i3 Milestone, LLC. is the sole developer of the software and will provide all licenses and support. The support agreement is in effect for a period of one (1) year to and including March 31, 2026.\n \nThe i3 Milestone ePortal is a new software solution that will support the Department of Public Utilities and its customers. It will be fully integrated with the Oracle customer cloud service, the interactive voice response system, and the Department’s bill print vendors. It will provide customers with various functionalities including the ability to retrieve historic bills, view and export usage data, and project rate increase and forecasted usage impacts on their budget. It will also provide our customers with easy navigation and the ability to update their account including paperless billing, billing alerts, and methods of communication. The new portal can be accessed to pay customers bills electronically via a desktop or mobile device. \n \nThe ePortal will provide the City with a reduced call volume due to the self-service functions, allowing the Department’s Customer Service and Billing sections to operate more efficiently.
