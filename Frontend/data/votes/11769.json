Wells Foundation in an amount up to $321,000.00 to act as fiscal manager of the American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI) program for one year with an option to extend an additional year.\n \nThe Housing Division uses non-federal funds for the purpose of down payment assistance for homebuyers not in the Homeownership Development program.   This funding will increase accessibility of the program to applicants up to 120% AMI and is projected to reduce the time to compile and review a file as specific HUD related required documents will not be required for this source of funds.  \n \nThe Tony R. Wells Foundation, a non-profit corporation, will act as a fiscal manager for the program.  The agreement will allocate $300,000.00 for downpayment assistance for low, moderate and middle income homebuyers and $21,000.00 (at 7% of the funds distributed) for administrative costs for the Wells Foundation.  The contract is awarded in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to not-for-profit service contracts.  The funds will all be provided to the Wells Foundation up front with ongoing reporting on disbursements.  \n \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested to prevent disruption of the ADDI program that provides down payment assistance for homebuyers.    \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Department of Development’s 2025 General Fund budget, but will require a transfer between divisions.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 038668 and expires 06/22/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Tony R.
