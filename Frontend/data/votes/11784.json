($500,000.00) (Amended by Ord. 1092-2025 passed on 4/28/2025 -LG).",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to modify a not-for-profit service contract with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation with respect to the Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative, authorized under Ordinance No. 2661-2023 and amended under Ordinance No. 1206-2024. This modification (Modification 1) will add $500,000.00 to the agreement to enable Ground Floor Growth LLC to continue to operate the Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative program.  Of this total modification, $50,000.00 will be allotted for Columbus Downtown Development Corporation’s administrative costs.\nOriginal contract amount                         $1,050,000.00                                          Ord. 1206-2024                                          PO448264\nModification No. 1 amount                   $    500,000.00\nTotal contract amount                                 $1,550,000.00 \n \nThe Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative (formally called the Downtown Commercial Marketplace Program) is a small business program that seeks to achieve multiple goals through one comprehensive program. The Program includes:\n•                     Providing downtown storefront space for small, local businesses who are oriented towards walk in customers (such as retail or restaurant businesses).\n \n•                     Providing a master lease holder to: 1) sublease to small, local businesses in a way that promotes their growth and gives them a safe place to land, and 2) rent vacant properties downtown and guarantee stability for the property owners of those spaces.\n \n•                     Providing technical assistance to the Program participants so that the businesses renting the downtown storefronts can grow and succeed.\nThis Program is designed to decrease vacancy downtown; promote small, local businesses; and promote the amenities of downtown as a neighborhood for Columbus residents living and working inside and outside of downtown.  Ground Floor Growth, LLC, whose sole member is the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC), will administer the master lease component of the program.  The City does not have the human resources to administer the program through existing staffing.\n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of additional funds to be expended under this modification is $500,000.00.\n2.                     The initial funding amount of $1,050,000.00 was insufficient to carry out the scope of work. Since this is a new program, initial funding was determined by a good-faith estimate and careful analysis; however, supplemental funding is required.\n3.                     Another vendor is not in the interest of the City as the current vendor is already administering the program. Choosing another vendor would result in a less qualified administrator of this program and a less efficient and more costly outcome. \n4.                     The additional funding needs were determined through a revised estimate as more information became available.\n \nFurther, this legislation seeks to declare an emergency to ensure that there are no delays in the continuation of the program, which includes the second round of the program which cannot be completed without additional funding.\nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Department of Development, Economic Development Division’s 2025 General Fund budget, this ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2025 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3035-2024.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify the agreement with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, for the Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative program in order to add $500,000.00 to the agreement to continue the work outlined in the scope of work in that agreement; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the 2025 General Fund budget; and to declare an emergency.
