    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with ParkMobile LLC relative to the ParkColumbus mobile payment application.\n \nOrdinance 0689-2023 authorized the execution of the original contract between the Department of Public Service and ParkMobile, LLC to facilitate the performance of various professional and technical tasks necessary to the operation and maintenance of the Mobile Payment Application System commonly known as ParkColumbus. Ordinance 1236-2024 authorized the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funds through March 31, 2025. This legislation seeks to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funding to sustain the ParkColumbus mobile payment application through at least March 31, 2026. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $1,600,000.00\nOriginal contract amount:                                                                                    $800,000.00                      (Ord. 0689-2023; PO398124)\nModification 1:                                                                                                                              $1,200,000.00                      (Ord. 1236-2024; PO469007)\nModification 2:                                                                                                                              $1,600,000.00--                     (This legislation)_________\nTotal contract amount including all modifications:                                 $3,600,000.00\n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen: This is a planned contract modification. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  ParkMobile LLC has been operating and maintaining ParkColumbus since its inception in 2019. Therefore, it is unlikely that seeking out and engaging another company to do so will result in significant cost savings for the City at this time. \n \n2.  REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF FORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS\nThe Division of Parking Services launched the ParkColumbus mobile payment application in 2019 in the Short North and has since expanded the application city-wide for all on-street paid public parking.  ParkMobile LLC has the experience, expertise and equipment to support and maintain the Mobile Payment Application System and has done so since its inception. Thus, a waiver of the formal competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is requested as it would be too time intensive and cost prohibitive to engage another company to operate and maintain that application. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nParkMobile LLC’s contract compliance number is CC030903 and expires July 28, 2025.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this expenditure is available within Fund 6500, the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund.  \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThe original contract for the Mobile Payment Application System was executed prior to the start of the MBE/WBE program, and this proposed contract modification also is exempt from this program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so that the requisite contract modification may be executed no later than March 31, 2025, when the current term ends, so as to avoid unnecessary disruptions in current on-street parking operations.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with ParkMobile LLC relative to the Mobile Payment Application System; to waive the formal competitive procurements of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,600,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund to pay for an additional year of this contract; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,600,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0689-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with ParkMobile, LLC to facilitate the implementation, maintenance and continued operation of the Mobile Payment Application System; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1236-2024 authorized the execution of a contract modification between the parties for the purposes of authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funding to provide for services through March 31, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing contract to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,200,000.00 to support the continued operation of the ParkColumbus mobile payment application as it is commonly known; and\n \nWHEREAS, ParkMobile, LLC has overseen the operation and maintenance of ParkColumbus since its inception in 2019, making it is necessary for Council to authorize a waiver of the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes to continue the Mobile Payment Application System program; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this legislation so that the requisite contract modification may be executed no later than March 31, 2025, so as to avoid unnecessary disruptions in current on-street parking operations, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the interim Director of the Department of Public Service be, and hereby is, authorized to enter into a contract modification with ParkMobile LLC, of 1100 Spring Street NW, Suite 200, Atlanta, GA 30309, relative to the Mobile Payment Application System.\n \nSECTION 2.  That City Council finds it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to waive the formal competitive bidding requirements of City Code Chapter 329 and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $1,600,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 6500 (Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund), Subfund 650001 (Mobility Enterprise), Dept-Div 5906 (Public Service - Parking Services), in Object Class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
