    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) for the Hoover Reservoir Walnut Street Boat Launch Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of the grant funds. The grant amount is up to $1,500,000.00 and the local match amount is up to $500,000.00. \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department entered into contract with Smoot Construction Company of Ohio for the Hoover Amenities Project in April of 2024 per Ordinance 0722-2024. The Hoover Amenities project is located at three locations around Hoover Reservoir. The fishing pier and boat launch ramp project aspects can be found near the intersection of Sunbury Road and Walnut Street at 7940 South Sunbury Road. The mudflats boardwalk is located at the north end of the reservoir and is located off of Front Street near Galena, Ohio. At both of these locations there are existing facilities that will require demolition and removal. The fishing pier will be a newly installed infrastructure.\nIn working through the design phase of the project, learning site conditions and costs associated with the overall project, the budget amount for the project exceeded the amount originally expected. As a result of this information, the Recreation and Parks Department met with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, who utilizes the Walnut Street Boat Launch site for research purposes, to discuss if any grant opportunities were available. ODNR identified the critical need for this amenity at this location from due to their operational needs and the priority of providing the community access to recreational boating opportunities in the area. As a result, ODNR was able to provide grant funding of up to $1,500,000.00. This grant funding requires the City of Columbus to provide matching funds of 25% of the total costs for the Walnut Street Boat Launch. The Recreation and Parks Department will provide up to $500,000.000 in match funding for this boat launch. The grant funding will focus on the launch ramp’s concrete surface, the docking system, and the attachments of the docking system to the ramp. The required grant match of up to 25% of the Walnut Street Boat Launch total is already encumbered as part of the existing Hoover Amenities Project contract mentioned above and authorized by Ordinance 0722-2024. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources         \n2045 Morse Road\nColumbus, Ohio 43229                                                      \nChris French, (614) 265-6721\n                                                    \nBenefits to the Public: Hoover Reservoir provides countless recreational opportunities to Columbus residents,\nincluding birding, hiking, boating, fishing, and more.
