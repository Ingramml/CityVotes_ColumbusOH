    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Board of Health to enter into a not-for-profit contract with Ohio State University on behalf of its Wexner Medical Center (OSU) for provisioning, hosting, training, and ongoing support of an electronic medical record system. Columbus Public Health has a need to implement Epic Systems Corporation’s (Epic) Electronic Medical Record technology (\"EMR\") via a hosting partnership with OSU through Epic's Connect platform; and, in order to better serve the health needs of our community.\n \nOSU is an instrumentality of the State of Ohio and an academic medical center whose mission is to improve people's lives through innovation in research, education and patient care. Columbus Public Health nor Department of Technology have resources to develop and implement an EMR of this scope. This contractor is a not-for-profit organization and is exempt from bidding in accordance of Section 329.30 of the Columbus City Code. \n \nAs the most globally adopted EMR, this transition will allow Columbus Public Health to streamline clinical services and flow, improve efficiencies and communication, promote interconnectedness with community providers, and allow for greater data collection, reporting, and analysis. Implementation will take place over 9-12 months and impact 290 public health users across the department, 15 of which are physicians or advanced practice providers.\n \nThe proposed agreement will provide for provisioning services, and ongoing support and hosting services for nine months from the date of a certified purchase order. Subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City authorities, the agreement includes options to renew for ten (10) additional one year terms.  The total cost associated with the first year of this agreement is $1,337,465.00 which includes implementation costs, training, and annual maintenance fees. Recurring maintenance fees are not included in this legislation and will begin during the roll-out of the EMR.  \n \nThis ordinance requests approval to enter into agreement with OSU in accordance of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $1,337,465.00 within the Health Department Grant Fund, Fund number 2251 for provisioning, hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical record system utilized by the Columbus Public Health. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract are available and budgeted in the Health Department Grant fund.\n \nEMERGENCY\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation. To ensure a contract for the provision of the above described services is in place for the department-wide implementation timeline and to align with the COVID-19 Enhanced Operations grant timeline to meet deliverables, emergency action is necessary. A lapse in implementation would negatively affect critical operations within the Health Department.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into a not-for-profit contract with Ohio State University on behalf of its Wexner Medical Center (OSU) for implementation, hosting, and ongoing support of an electronic medical record system, in accordance with Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $1,337,465.00 from the Health Department Grant fund; and to declare an emergency.
