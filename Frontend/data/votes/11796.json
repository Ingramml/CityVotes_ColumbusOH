    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court, Clerk of Court (hereinafter \"Municipal Court Clerk\") to modify the current agreement with DBAffinity LLC by adding additional services to update and upgrade our database.\n \nLast year, the Municipal Court Clerk learned that our Oracle data base must be updated to the latest version, but before those updates can occur, the database has to be cloned. DBAffinity LLC, who currently contracts with the Municipal Court Clerk for data migration, training production and server updates is familiar with the Municipal Court Clerk’s current infrastructure and can perform the necessary services. \n \nThis Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications.\n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds: The total amount needed for the modification is $9,450.00. DBAffinity LLC provided a quote for the services. \n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The necessity of these updates was not known to the Municipal Court Clerk until after entering into PO466648 for data migration services.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used: The Municipal Court Clerk currently has a contract with DBAffinity LLC, PO466648, and has serviced the Municipal Court Clerk’s database administration needs previously, having successfully updated the production and training database servers, migrated from Oracle 10 to Oracle 19, and is currently patching and updating those servers and databases. Their deep familiarity with the Municipal Court Clerk’s infrastructure and data workflows makes it in the best interest of the city to not have additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes.\n \n4.                     How was cost determined: The modification is based upon rates established in the existing contract. \n \nContract Compliance: DBAffinity LLC\nContract Compliance # 27-1127033\nExpiration Date: 09/03/26\nVendor Number:  028855\n \nContracts:\nPO466648; $28,800.00\nOrdinance 0548-2025; $9,450.00\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the excluded party listing system of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved finding for recovery certified search.\n \nEmergency:  There is an immediate need to modify the contract with DBAffinity LLC for the continuity of the Municipal Court Clerk’s database updates, maintenance and support services. \n \nFiscal Impact:  The amount of $9,450.00 is available within the Municipal Court Clerk Computer Fund.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the current agreement with DBAffinity LLC for database services; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $9,450.00 from the Municipal Court Clerk Computer Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($9,450.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the current agreement with DBAffinity LLC Inc by adding additional funds for unforeseen database services for the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office; and, \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, and\n \nWHEREAS, this upgrade will help to avoid unnecessary costs and maintain optimal support for the Municipal Court Clerk’s operations; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to modify said contracts for the continuity of database services, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Franklin County Municipal Court is hereby authorized to modify the current agreement with DBAffinity LLC Inc by adding additional funds for unforeseen, necessary database services for the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office.\n \nSECTION 2. That this Council finds that it is in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the City Code to enter in this contract and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $9,450.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 2227 (Computer Fund), sub fund 222702, Department-Division 2601 (Municipal Court Clerk), Object Class 03 (Contractual Services), per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5: That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which are hereby made a part of hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
