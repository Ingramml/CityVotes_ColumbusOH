    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND AND BID INFORMATION:\nThis legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to issue purchase orders to Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Inc., ZOLL Medical Corporation and Stryker Sales Corporation for the purchase of Fire and EMS emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment.\nCompetitive bidding is being waived for each of the below vendors.  City agencies are required to obtain at least three actual quotes from State Term Schedules (STS). Due to reasons referenced below, the Fire Division requests procurement via STS which requires a bid waiver. Therefore, all these requests for the following purchases, which are being made via STS contracts, will require bid waiver.\n \nThe apparatus from Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Inc., (Pierce Tillers and Horton Medics) have been the Fire Division's standardized equipment for several years, as both the Divisions of Fire and Fleet Management believe these products are the best for their operations given the quality, durability and customizability each manufacturer offers, as well as the cost-effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with each manufacturer during the build process.  The subsequent contracts established by Fleet Management with each manufacturer have also simplified the managing of parts/service after purchase.\n \nAtlantic Emergency Solutions ~ FID #273187193 / Vendor 034448 / SOS Entity 4595230 ~ The Division of Fire is in need to purchase one (1) Pierce Enforcer 107' Ascendant Tiller in the amount of $2,570,629.00. This purchase is made in accordance with State of Ohio Index #STS618, Schedule #800918, which expires 6/30/2025. The amount listed for the tiller also includes two (2) travel trips for eight (8) people for inspections and training. The amount of this travel is $33,000.00.\nThe Division of Fire also requests the purchase two (2) EMS transport vehicles (medics) in the total amount of $789,176.00 and three (3) existing Horton Medics re-chassis in the total amount of $587,024.00.  The Division of Fire has standardized its custom EMS response apparatus fleet using Horton Emergency Vehicles for many years due to the cost-effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with the manufacturer and managing of parts/service after purchase. This purchase is made in accordance with State of Ohio Index #STS233.\nStryker Sales Corporation ~ FID #382902424 / Vendor 030281 / SOS Entity 766815 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase of fifteen (15) Stryker Ambulance Power Cots for each of the EMS Transport vehicles as well as the purchase of twenty-two (22) Stryker Ambulance Stair-Chairs for use on EMS vehicles in the total amount of $1,132,775.14. A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code, Chapter 329 is necessary for both. The Stryker Power Cot and the Stryker Stair-Chair are standardized equipment deployed on EMS vehicles, making it manifestly impractical to bid given Stryker is the sole distributor for their proprietary equipment.\nZOLL Medical Corporation ~ FID #042711626 / Vendor #000197 / SOS Entity 2074262 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase of six (6) refurbished X Series Monitor/Defibrillators in the total amount of $134,539.68.  A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329 is necessary for this purchase as the ZOLL Monitor/Defibrillators are standardized EMS equipment deployed by the Division of Fire.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Current build times (900 calendar days for aerial ladders) for the fire apparatus purchased in this ordinance require emergency action to ensure funds are encumbered immediately to allow for the production of these custom apparatus to commence upon passage of this ordinance and confirmation of the subsequent purchase orders.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  Cash is available upon transfer within the Safety Voted Bond Fund for this purchase. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is also required. \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $5,214,143.82 within various projects of the Safety Voted Bond Fund; to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into contracts with Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Inc., Stryker Sales Corporation, and ZOLL Medical Corporation for the purchase of emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment needed by the Division of Fire; to authorize the expenditure of $5,214,143.82 from the Safety Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($5,214,143.82)\nBody\nWHEREAS, a need exists within the Fire Division to purchase front line response rescue and fire apparatus and related equipment; and,\nWHEREAS, a transfer of funds within the Safety Voted Bond Fund is necessary to fund this purchase; and,\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; and;\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds from the Safety Voted Bond Fund; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to issue purchase orders to Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Stryker Sales Corporation, and ZOLL Medical Corporation for the purchase of emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment needed by the Division of Fire; and,\nWHEREAS, a waiver to the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes is necessary as per the attachment to this ordinance; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to make these purchases and transfer said funds from within the Safety Voted Bond Fund to purchase said equipment, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; Now, Therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
