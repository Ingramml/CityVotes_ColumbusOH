    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kokosing Industrial, Inc., via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project, CIP #650353-100007, in an amount up to $443,275,000.00; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $443,277,000.00.\n \nThis project will provide the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) with an upgraded biosolids digestion system and a cogeneration facility. The upgraded digestion system includes the construction of two three-million gallon digesters, an extension of Tunnel C, and a new digester control building (DC5). Six of the existing digesters will be upgraded with concrete covers to address fugitive methane issues. To increase the amount of biogas generated by the digesters, a new fats, oils, and grease (FOG) digester is planned to be constructed.  A new cogeneration facility will be built to create heat and electricity from the digester biogas. This facility includes a previously purchased gas cleaning system. The cogeneration engines will require the construction of a new Northwest Switching Station (NWSS).\n \nThis project plans to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) rebate being offered to energy communities and municipalities. Under the available IRS guidance, the City of Columbus will be eligible for a rebate up to 50% of the construction cost. According to our current construction cost estimate, this project would be eligible for approximately $120 million in rebates.  To obtain this rebate, the project had to meet what the IRS called the “Beginning of Construction” deadline of December 31, 2024.  The project must either have had 5% of the construction cost paid to the Contractor by then or must have had substantial construction begin and continue through the completion of the project (Substantial Work Test).  The City met the “Beginning of Construction” requirement by having fabrication start on essential plant equipment.  The City must now demonstrate “project continuity”.  The contract with Kokosing Industrial, Inc., is for the general construction of the facility.  General construction must begin as soon as practical in order to show project continuity from the equipment procurement packages through the completion of the project. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU) performed several outreach efforts to try to get multiple bidders for this project.  These outreach efforts included contacting construction firms across the nation, holding informational sessions, and providing updates on the progress of the design and estimated bid dates.  The project received one bid. That bid was in excess of $545 million (nearly double the engineer’s estimate).  DPU considered rebidding the project in its entirety, breaking the project into smaller projects and rebidding them, and cancelling the project.  Market research was also performed to determine why the bid was so high.  The final conclusion was Central Ohio construction market conditions had driven the price of this bid up as it was doing to other construction projects, rebidding was not likely to result in a lower price, and rebidding may actually increase the price or result in no bid at all.  The chosen approach was to negotiate with the only bidder in an attempt to reduce the project cost.  This negotiation resulted in savings due to redesign and efficiencies gained, and ultimately netted a price reduction of $101,774,000.00.  A waiver of the City’s competitive bidding requirements must be requested due to the negotiation of price.    \n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 99, City-wide.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 2,234 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The proposed award amount is $443,275,000.00, including a 5.1% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                        $ 443,275,000.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                            $                0.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                            $          2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                $ 443,277,000.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project was specifically designed to have the greatest positive economic impact possible. Due to the federal Inflation Reduction Act, non-tax paying entities with qualified biogas properties, including digesters, digestion infrastructure, and cogeneration equipment, are eligible for a tax rebate. This project was designed to achieve the maximum rebate possible (50% on eligible portions). The cogeneration facility will allow the SWWTP to offset some of the purchased power, reducing a portion of the operating budget.\n \nThis project was also designed with the environment in mind. The cogeneration facility will allow the SWWTP to offset some of the purchased power and associated greenhouse gas emissions. This project will also mitigate fugitive methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) emissions from the digestion complex. The addition of a FOG (fats, oils, grease) receiving station will allow diversion of FOG from the landfill and allow for beneficial reuse.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the SWWTP Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 08/09/24 through 09/25/24.  One bid was received for the project and was opened on 09/25/24.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                   Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\nKokosing Industrial, Inc.            $545,049,000.00*                          CC012309                          MAJ\n \n*The contracted amount will be $443,275,000.00 as negotiations resulted in a reduction in the bid price. \n \nThe Kokosing Industrial, Inc. bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid.\n \n4.  WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS\nA waiver of the competitive bidding requirements for construction in City Code Chapter 329 is requested.  The only bid received was 190% higher than the engineer estimate.  The Department of Public Utilities chose to negotiate the price instead of rebidding or cancelling the bid.  This negotiation resulted in a price decrease of $101,774,000.00.  Negotiating a bid price is not an option under City Code for construction projects, so a waiver of the construction bid requirements of City Code must be requested.\n \n5.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nKokosing Industrial, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC012309 and expires 5/4/25.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Kokosing Industrial, Inc. \n \n6.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 8% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 8% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nKokosing Industrial, Inc. listed 26 subcontractors for this project:\n \nSee the attached Utilization Report for the subcontractor listing.\n \nThe certification of Kokosing Industrial, Inc., and the above referenced companies (on attached Utilization Report) were in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n7.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nKokosing Industrial, Inc. and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n8.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2720-2024, passed by Council on 10/28/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA March Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.\nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.   An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, is necessary to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kokosing Industrial, Inc., for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project;
