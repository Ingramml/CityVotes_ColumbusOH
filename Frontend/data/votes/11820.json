    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize the Charter Celebration for Antioch Jordan Baptist Church\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, In the spirit of unity, faith, and divine purpose, Antioch Jordan Baptist Church was born-a sacred union between two historic houses of faith, Antioch Baptist Church and Jordan Bible Church. Rooted in the rich spiritual legacy of Central Ohio, these two congregations came together, not by chance, but by divine design, forging a new chapter in the story of God’s people; and \n \nWHEREAS, Under the visionary leadership of Rev. Charles E. Newman, the organizing pastor, Antioch Jordan Baptist Church held its inaugural worship service on March 2, 2025 and on that day, voices were lifted, hearts were stirred, and a fresh wind of the Holy Spirit moved among the people, affirming that we are indeed better together; and \n \nWHEREAS, Though our name is new, our foundation is strong. We stand upon the prayers, sacrifices, and unwavering faith of those who came before us. From the classrooms where the Word was taught, to the pulpits where the gospel was preached, to the outreach efforts that touched countless lives-our legacy is one of service, love, and commitment to the Kingdom of God; and\n \nWHEREAS, And yet, this is just the beginning. As time unfolds, our history will continue to be written-in the testimonies of transformed lives, in the hands that serve the community, and in the generations that will rise up to declare God’s goodness; and \n \nWHEREAS, Antioch Jordan Baptist Church is more than a building; it is a movement of faith. A family united in Christ. A beacon of hope in Central Ohio. With God as our guide, we move forward, hand in hand, heart to heart, committed to the mission He has placed before us; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize March 22nd, 2025 as the charter celebration of God’s new covenant, Antioch Jordan Baptist Church.",
