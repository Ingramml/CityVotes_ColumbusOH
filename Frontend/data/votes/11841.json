    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects.  ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is accepting applications to fund projects that address locations with a history of fatal or injury crashes where low-cost safety improvements have failed to solve the problem. The Highway Safety Improvement Program accepts formal safety applications twice a year, on March 31 and August 31; and it accepts abbreviated safety applications four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31; and it accepts systemic safety applications once a year on January 31. These grants require a minimum 10% local match. \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted an application seeking funds to construct safety improvements in the area of the Airport Drive at N Cassady Avenue intersection. This ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute project agreements for approved projects, to accept and expend grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued. Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications for the project listed below:\n \n538018-100000 - Intersection - Cassady Avenue and Airport Drive: This project includes improvements to the intersection of Airport Drive at N Cassady Avenue to add pedestrian and bicycle facilities in the form of a Shared Use Path (SUP) and lighting, install a median to provide access management, and make safety improvements at the two adjacent intersections along N Cassady Avenue with Airport Drive and Plaza Properties Boulevard. The intersection with Airport Drive will be widened to accommodate additional turn lanes and improve the alignment of the eastbound and westbound lanes.  A roundabout will be installed at Plaza Properties Boulevard. This is a spring 2025 formal safety application, and the total cost for the intersection improvements is approximately $7,900,000.00.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) accepts formal applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds on March 31 and August 31; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT accepts abbreviated applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service submitted applications seeking funds to construct safety improvements in the area of the Airport Drive at N Cassady Avenue intersection; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to submit applications to, and to execute grant agreements with, ODOT, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with ODOT, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to execute grant agreements, with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program; and to accept and expend awarded grant funds.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service submitted applications for the projects listed above.  City Council understands and approves that this list may change at the discretion of the Director of Public Service if other projects are found to be good candidates to be awarded these grant funds or if a reason should be found not to submit one of the listed projects.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Department of Public Service is authorized to issue refunds of awarded or reimbursed grant funds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued. \n \nSECTION 4.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which those funds originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
