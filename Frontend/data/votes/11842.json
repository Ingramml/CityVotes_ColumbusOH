    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND\n \nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) annually accepts applications to fund projects using Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program funds.  SRTS funds are available to communities as grants to be used to improve the ability of elementary and middle school students to walk and bicycle to school safely.  A community may be awarded up to $1,000,000 for an infrastructure project.  March 7, 2025 is the deadline for the current Safe Routes to School application cycle.\n \nThe Department of Public Service has prepared a Safe Routes to School application, with a current focus on filling sidewalk gaps along priority corridors for five schools: Cranbrook Elementary School, Eastgate Elementary School, Innis Elementary School, Northtowne Elementary School, and Scottwood Elementary School.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECT\nThe Department of Public Service submitted an application for the following project:\n \nSafe Routes to School Sidewalk Gaps: This project is focused on filling sidewalk gaps on or near priority corridors for five different elementary schools: Cranbrook ES, Eastgate ES, Innis ES, Northtowne ES, Scottwood ES.  The proposed sidewalk gaps to be filled are as follows:\n•                     Cranbrook ES\no                     Fishinger Road - Sidewalk gap on the south side of a priority corridor for the school, from Easton Place east to existing sidewalk.\n•                     Eastgate ES\no                     Stratford Way - Sidewalk gap on the south side of a priority corridor for the school, from approximately Greenway Avenue west to existing sidewalk.\n•                     Innis ES\no                     Walnut Creek Drive- Sidewalk gap on the west/north side of a priority corridor for the school, from Stonehenge Drive south to existing sidewalk.\no                     Woodsedge Road- Sidewalk gap on the east/south side of a priority corridor for the school, between Winding Hills Drive/Woodsedge Court and Broadleaf Lane.\no                     Woodsedge Road- Sidewalk gap on the east/south side of a priority corridor for the school, from Woodsedge Court south to existing sidewalk.\n•                     Northtowne ES\no                     Waymont Road - sidewalk gap on the south side of a priority corridor for the school, from Heaton Road east to existing sidewalk.\no                     Heaton Road- sidewalk gap on the west side, from Waymont Road north to existing sidewalk.  \n•                     Scottwood ES\no                     Seabrook Avenue- Sidewalk gap on the south side of a priority corridor for the school, from Picard Road east to existing sidewalk.\no                     Coburg Road/Seabrook Avenue - This is a corner sidewalk gap at the intersection of Coburg Road and Seabrook Avenue.  On Coburg Avenue, sidewalk gap is on the east side of a priority corridor for the school, from Seabrook Avenue south to existing sidewalk.  On Seabrook Avenue, the sidewalk gap is on the south side of a priority corridor for the school, from Coburg Road east to existing sidewalk.\no                     Seabrook Avenue - Sidewalk gap on the north side, from Selkirk Road to Courtright Road.\no                     This project would also install three Type II crosswalks along Seabrook Avenue at its intersections with Picard Road, Coburg Road, and Selkirk Road.  All three crosswalks would be installed across the intersections’ south legs.  The current project cost estimate for this phase is approximately $668,754.00.\n \n(This listing is meant to be illustrative and is believed to be accurate and complete; however, last minute project additions and substitutions are at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.)\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts, right of way acquisition, and/or construction contracts that will be submitted for Council's approval.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Service, to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Safe Routes to School Program;
