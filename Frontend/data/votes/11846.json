    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Urban Forestry Grant Program, which will be used to plant up to 250 street trees in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Columbus.\n \nStreet trees provide critical benefits to residents. They filter the air, cool the air, reduce flooding, and provide shade. Columbus has the fastest-growing and eighth-most intense heat island of 60 major cities studied. In 2022, a summer heat mapping campaign found a 13.2 degree difference in evening temperatures, confirming some residents are inequitably experiencing more heat stress. Planting public trees will reduce temperatures in neighborhoods disproportionately affected by urban heat.\n \nThe grant funds will be used to contract with local vendors to plant up to 250 street trees in the next three years, in neighborhoods that are considered disadvantaged based on the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool, a requirement of the grant. The City's recently completed street tree inventory identified 96,498 available planting sites. The estimated unit price per tree planted is $400.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry                 \n2045 Morse Road, H-1\nColumbus, Ohio 43229                                                      \nAlistair Reynolds, (614) 265-6547\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the grant application can be submitted before grant awards are decided in April 2025.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Increased tree canopy in under-served neighborhoods, providing air filtration, reduced flooding, shade, and other benefits to residents.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Urban Forestry Master Plan engaged thousands of stakeholders during its creation. Since its approval in 2021, numerous area commissions and civic organizations have requested street tree investments from the City.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the city’s natural resources and overall environmental health, benefiting current and future generations.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. Future legislation will accept, appropriate, and encumber funding for this project as needed if the grant is awarded. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Urban Forestry Grant Program, which will be used to plant up to 250 street trees in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Columbus; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Urban Forestry Grant Program, which will be used to plant up to 250 street trees in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance shows the City of Columbus' support for all application requirements; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to apply for this grant funding so the grant application can be submitted before grant awards are decided in April 2025, all for the immediate preservation of public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the City of Columbus does agree to obligate the funds required to satisfactorily complete the proposed project and become eligible for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Urban Forestry Grant Program.\nSECTION 5.
