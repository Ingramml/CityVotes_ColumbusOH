    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nOn February 10, 2025, Columbus City Council adopted Ordinance No. 0274-2025, which authorized the Director of the Department of Public Safety to amend a contract agreement with SoundThinking Inc. to continue the use of a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis program.
