    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction services modification contract with D & M Painting Corp. for the Rome-Hilliard West Tank Painting Improvements project, C.I.P. Number 690477-100020, in an amount up to $28,501.81. \n \nThe work consists of abrasive blasting and recoating of the entire exterior, interior wet ceiling and spot repairs of the interior dry areas of a 2-million-gallon capacity fluted column steel elevated water storage tank, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract, in accordance with the technical specifications, and City of Columbus Construction and Material Specifications as set forth in the Invitation For Bid (IFB). \n                     \nModification No. 1 is for the additional costs in the project that exceeded the contingency due to lead paint being discovered on the exterior and interior dry.  The contractor also filed a claim for differing site conditions involving the material of coating in the interior wet.  The coating was presented to be more difficult to remove through abrasive blasting than typical coatings for this application.  Removal of this coating required additional time and material not included in the original bid.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 36 - Far West.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:  No additional time will be added to the contract.  All work shall still be completed within 180 calendar days of the date the Notice to Proceed was issued.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $28,501.81\nOriginal Contract (PO445365; ORD 0676-2024)                                          $ 1,732,758.50                                          \nModification No. 1 (PO TBD; ORD 0504-2025)                                          $     28,501.81\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                              $ 1,761,260.31\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s IFB process.  Unexpected work conditions (the discovery that lead paint was previously used on the job) changed the cost of the job.  Another procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nProposed pricing was based upon current contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  Negotiations between the vendor and the Public Utilities project management team resulted in the price to perform the extra work.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThere are currently 38 water tanks in the distribution system and 26 of them are maintained by the City of Columbus, Division of Water.  To keep these tanks in optimal condition, each year tank interiors or exteriors are identified to be recoated.  \n \nThis project provides painting improvements for the maintenance of a steel elevated water storage tank. These improvements will keep this tank in optimal condition and prolong its service life.  Regular maintenance inspections have determined that the Rome-Hilliard West tank exterior needs to be blasted and recoated at this time. The interior wet ceiling and spots of the interior dry area coating systems also need to be blasted and recoated.  The project will include various safety improvements such as fall protection tie-off lugs on roof and a rooftop handrail opening safety gate. Special consideration towards environmentally friendly operations will be implemented, one of which is the recycling of the Garnet abrasive blast media, which results in significantly reducing the volume of waste sent to the landfill. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nD & M Painting Corp.’s contract compliance number is CC001949 and expired on 2/5/26.  D & M Painting Corp. will need to renew their contract compliance number prior to the finalization of the modification contract.  Searches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against D & M Painting Corp. \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.\nD & M Painting Corp. does not have any subcontractors performing contract work on this project.  The projected MBE/WBE percentage is 0.0%.\n \n5.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nD & M Painting Corp. has met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $28,501.81 is available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction services contract modification with D & M Painting Corp. for the Rome-Hilliard West Tank Painting Improvements project;
