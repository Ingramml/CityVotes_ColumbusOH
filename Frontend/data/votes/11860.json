    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Evans Mechwart Hambleton & Tilton Inc. (EMH&T Inc.), for construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities construction projects bid during the calendar years 2023 through 2025 as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contracts.  The construction project to be administered by EMH&T Inc. under this contract modification is the Blueprint Volunteer Sump Pump 2025 project, CIP No. 650876-129992, in an amount up to $214,836.28.\n \nThe Blueprint Volunteer Sump Pump 2025 project will install sump pumps in homes to redirect foundation drain away from the sanitary sewer lateral to the house’s sump pit.  This will reduce rainwater infiltration of the sanitary sewers by directing the rainwater to storm sewers.  This redirection reduces basement flooding and assists with compliance of environmental requirements to keep rainwater out of the sanitary sewer system.  This project will cover 400 properties that represent the 10% target participation rate in the following areas: Clintonville 1, Phase 4; Clintonville 3, Phase 1; Hilltop 1, Phase 3; Hilltop 4;  and Phase 1 of Miller/Kelton, Linden, James/Livingston, Old Beechwold, and 5th by Northwest 1.  Construction administration and inspection services ensure work is consistent with and conforms to plans and specifications, and that the construction and any associated issues are handled efficiently and in the best interest of the City of Columbus.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Community Planning Area 99 - Citywide.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE\nThe original contract allowed for work is to be completed within the timeframe established by the individual construction contracts.  This contract modification will be in effect through the completion of construction for this project.\n \n1.1.
