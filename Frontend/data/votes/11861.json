    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Accenture LLP (previously HR Gray & Associates, LLC) for construction administration/inspection services as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2020-2022 contract.  The construction project to be administered under this contract modification is the Blueprint Volunteer Sump Pump 2022 project, CIP No. #650876-122991, in an amount up to $90,000.00.\n \nAccenture LLP was awarded a contract to perform construction administration/inspection (CA/CI) services for Department of Public Utilities Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) that bid during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.  The contract was modified as needed throughout the three-year contract period to include projects as they went to construction.  The Blueprint Sump Pump Volunteer 2022 project, CIP #650876-122991, already a part of this contract, needs $90,000.00 in additional funding for CA/CI services.  While the contract does not allow modifications to add new construction projects after 12/31/22, it does allow modifications to add funding to perform CA/CI services for projects that were already a part of the contract.\n \nThe Blueprint Volunteer Sump Pump 2022 project installs sump pumps in homes to redirect foundation drain away from the sanitary sewer lateral to the house’s sump pit.  This will reduce rainwater infiltration of the sanitary sewers by directing the rainwater to storm sewers.  This redirection reduces basement flooding and assists with compliance of environmental requirements to keep rainwater out of the sanitary sewer system.  This project will cover 500 properties that represent the 25% target participation rate in the following areas: Clintonville 1, Phase 4; Clintonville 3, Phase 1; Hilltop 1, Phase 3; Hilltop 4; and Phase 1 of Miller/Kelton, Linden, James/Livingston, Old Beechwold, and 5th by Northwest.\n \nConstruction administration and inspection services ensure work is consistent with and conforms to plans and specifications, and that the construction and any associated issues are handled efficiently and in the best interest of the City of Columbus.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Community Planning Area 99 - Citywide.\n \n1.1.
