    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Resource International, Inc., for construction administration/inspection services as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contracts, PO384346, PO384348, PO384351.  \n \nResource International, Inc. was awarded a contract to perform construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities Capital Improvement projects that bid during the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.  The contract is modified as needed throughout the three-year contract period to include these projects as they go to construction.  The construction project to be administered by Resource International, Inc. under this contract modification is Lazelle South Tank Painting Improvements, CIP No. 690477-100021 in the amount of $409,874.90.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “32 - Far North”.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $409,874.90\nOriginal Contract:                   $540,123.70 (ORD 0200-2023; PO384346, PO384348, PO384351)\nModification #1:                     $99,810.09 (ORD 1912-2023; PO405218)\nModification #2:                                      $1,200,000.00 (ORD 2722-2023: PO426442)\nModification #3:                                $599,643.52 (ORD 2855-2023; PO426448, PO426452)                     \nModification #4:                                $705,530.65 (ORD 3111-2023; PO429838)\nModification #5:                                $342,793.47 (ORD 0065-2024; PO433096)\nModification #6:                                $396,719.17 (ORD 0544-2024; PO444847)\nModification #7:                                $62,341.50 (ORD 3017-2024; PO487347)\nModification #8:                                $409,874.90 (Current; PO TBD)                                          \n               Total                     $4,356,837.00\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 0200-2023.  \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the contract rates and job titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each job title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss.  Other projects provide improvements to elevated water storage tanks and booster pump stations that are part of the water distribution system.  The Neighborhood Liaison(s) will be contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nResource International, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004197 and expires 1/30/2026.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and ODI did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  Resource International, Inc. is classified as a WBE company by ODI.  As shown in the Utilization Plan attached to this ordinance, Resource International, Inc. does not plan to use any subconsultants on this task.  MBE/WBE participation for this modification is projected to be 100.00%.  \n \nResource International, Inc.’s certification was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are appropriated and available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the work to be completed before winter.  This will reduce the time this critical piece of water distribution equipment is out-of-service, reducing the risk of not being able to supply water to residents, and prevents delay charges the City will incur if this project has to be completed after winter.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Resource International for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; and to expend up to $409,874.90 from the Water Bond Fund for the modification;
