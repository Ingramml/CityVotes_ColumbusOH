($75,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services to modify an existing service contract with Touchstone IQ LLC to add natural gas automated benchmarking services for building owners in Columbus in order to track gas usage data from Columbia Gas. Currently, building owners with multiple natural gas tenants have no data aggregation tool and do not have access to whole-building natural gas usage. The existing contract between the Department of Building and Zoning Services and Touchstone IQ LLC for energy benchmarking software license, maintenance and support allows the Department to manage all building and energy use data in addition to tracking owner communications.\nCity Code Chapter 4117, Energy Benchmarking, requires building owners to submit benchmarking reports to the City.  In order to do that, the owners need access to aggregate, monthly, whole-building energy usage data. The additional services provided through this contract modification will give the owners access to their building’s gas usage data, enabling them to comply with the Energy Benchmarking Code. \nIn Columbus, buildings account for 55% of community-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, a major contributing factor to climate change. The reports submitted by building owners required by the Energy Benchmarking Code are necessary in order to track city emissions and meet the City’s carbon reduction goals. \nThe term of the contract modification will be from April 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025 to coincide with the existing contract term.\nContract Compliance\nVendor: Touchstone IQ LLC (D365 Vendor Acct:  032992)\nCertification #:  CC-032992 - Exp:  12/12/2026\nThe company is not disbarred according to the excluded party listing system of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved finding for recovery certified search.\nPrincipal Party:\nTouchstone IQ LLCJon Dierking, CEO2000 S ColoradoAnnex Building Suite 460Denver, CO 80222jon.dierking@touchstoneiq.com <mailto:jon.dierking@touchstoneiq.com>\n \nState of Ohio Number 5154184\n \nFiscal Impact:\nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of $75,000.00 for this contract modification, which is available in Fund 2240, the Development Services Fund. \nOriginal Contract Amount:                                          $49,240.00                     PO482741\nModification Amount:                                                               $75,000.00\nTotal Contractor Amount:                                          $124.240.00\n \nEmergency Justification:\nThe automated benchmarking services offered to building owners through this contract modification will provide them with 24 months of historical data once the building owner has set up the tool. Furthermore, the annual Energy Benchmarking Code deadline to submit reports is June 1. In order to make the tool available to Columbus building owners in time for the June 1 deadline, and in the interest in providing owners with historical data in a timely manner, emergency action is requested to expedite the authorization of this contract modification.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Building and Zoning Services to modify an existing service contract with Touchstone IQ LLC to add natural gas automated benchmarking services; to authorize an appropriation in the Development Services Fund; and to authorize an expenditure from the Development Services Fund; and to declare an emergency.
