    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Franklin County Public Health, in an amount up to $80,400.00 to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.  The term of this contract shall be through the program year 2026 with the option to renew for one (1) additional year. \n \nThe funding for the Lead Safe Columbus (LSC) Program is obtained through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for release of funds from the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Grant Program, authorized by Sec. 1011 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (Title X of the Housing & Community Development Act of 1992) for the following multi-year project: Lead Safe Columbus grant period running March 1, 2025 through March 1, 2029. \n \nThe funding for the Lead Safe Ohio Program is obtained through the Ohio Department of Development (ODOD) for lead-safe renovation, repair, painting and abatement as appropriate. Residential dwellings built on or before 1978 and where household’s income is at or below 80% Area Media Income (AMI) are eligible for the program. Households where income is above 80% AMI but less than 120% AMI can qualify if a lead hazard is identified. Childcare facilities and congregate shelters built prior to 1978 are also eligible.  Approved applicants could receive home repairs including roof replacement, window and door replacement, and mechanical repairs.  If the house was built prior to 1978 and the scope of work exceeds $25,000, the selected Contractor would be assigned to perform lead inspections, risk assessment reports, work specifications, and final lead clearance testing in privately-owned residential housing units.\n \nFranklin County Public Health would be assigned to perform and provide risk assessment reports, work specifications, and final lead clearance testing residential homes, residential and commercial childcare facilities, and congregate shelters.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ029435 on Vendor Services and proposals seeking contracts to provide lead safe abatement services for residential properties on December 17, 2024 with bids being due on January 27, 2025.  \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees as they are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested to continue performing the needed services for residents as quickly as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the ODOD LEAD Grant (G442400) Fund budget;  Lead-24 Grant (G442500); and the Housing Division’s 2025 General Fund budget for this purpose.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006183 and expires 10/17/2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract in an amount up to $80,400.00 with Franklin County Public Health, to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; and to authorize the expenditure in an amount up to $50,400.00, using LHR24 Grant, up to $10,000.00, using ODOD LEAD Grant, and up to $20,000.00, using general fund; and to declare an emergency.
