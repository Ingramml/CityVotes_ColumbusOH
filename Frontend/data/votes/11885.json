MWAC means a megawatt of alternating current electric generating capacity.\n \nOrdinance 0210-2021 authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a letter of intent and negotiate solar power purchase agreements for the Division of Power and to enter into associated interconnection agreements. It also authorized the Director of Finance to enter into license or lease agreements for selected Department of Public Utilities (DPU) sites. Ordinance 3114-2022 modified the terms and conditions of these power purchase agreements to increase the negotiated price and to amend the right of entry agreements. \n \nOrdinance 1849-2024 further modified the agreements by appropriating funds to pay for the negotiated prices. The invoices for the 2024 payments were received in January 2025. However, one of the agreement’s previous vendors - DG Columbus Solar LLC - merged with DG Harvest 2023 LLC in November 2023. Due to this change, this legislation also authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify past outstanding, present, and future contracts and purchase orders with DG Columbus Solar LLC and authorizes the assignment of all past outstanding, present, and future business done by the City of Columbus from DG Columbus Solar LLC to DG Harvest 2023 LLC.
