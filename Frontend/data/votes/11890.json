    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the South Side Thrive Collaborative in support of the Parson Avenue Outreach Program.\n \nSouth Side Thrive Collaborative (SSTC) is a non-profit organization with a mission of bringing people together to create a strong and resilient Columbus’ South Side. SSTC envisions a diverse and vibrant South Side community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. SSTC formed from a simple idea, that the community can accomplish more together than by working alone. The need is significant in Columbus’ South Side. To achieve impact, it requires a collaborative and coordinated effort to identify and address the complex, often overlapping, circumstances that cause hardship for South Side low-income individuals and families.\n \nThe purpose of the Parsons Avenue Outreach Program is to build relationships with residents, businesses, service providers, and people accessing services along the Parsons Avenue corridor while promoting public safety, cleanliness, general order, and access to coordinated services. To achieve this purpose, SSTC will hire and deploy 2 new full-time outreach team members, including one (1) Community Outreach Specialist and one (1) Community Outreach Coordinator to plan and organize day-to-day work plans. Staff will act as trusted, dependable persons that are accessible and compassionately engaging with individuals in and along Parsons Avenue. The program area of focus will be Parsons Avenue from Livingston Avenue to the viaduct just south of Hosack Street. The 2.5 mile area will be broken into four zones so that staff can have consistent presence along the corridor. During outreach, staff will distribute, as needed, small amounts of bottled water, granola bars, and winter hats or gloves, to people they are engaging to provide immediate sustenance and as a tool to build rapport and trust. Council deems the purchase and distribution of the aforementioned food and beverages to serve a public purpose in that it will serve to engage the vulnerable residents that SSTC is seeking to assist, and that up to $2,400.00 of the total expenditure may be expended on food and non-alcoholic beverages.\n \nSince the organization lacks the funding necessary to operate the program on a reimbursement basis, funds will be advanced to the South Side Thrive Collaborative in order to initiate services.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the South Side Thrive Collaborative in support of the Parsons Avenue Outreach Program; to authorize the expenditure of funds on reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($165,900.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, South Side Thrive Collaborative (SSTC) is a non-profit organization with a mission of bringing people together to create a strong and resilient Columbus’ South Side; and\n \nWHEREAS, the purpose of the Parsons Avenue Outreach Program is to build relationships with residents, businesses, service providers, and people accessing services along the Parsons Ave corridor while promoting public safety, cleanliness, general order, and access to coordinated services; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the South Side Thrive Collaborative in support of the Parson Avenue Outreach Program.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $165,900.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That per the action authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $165,900.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 4. That funds shall be paid in advance to the South Side Thrive Collaborative in order for the organization to have the capital necessary to hire and deploy the anticipated staff needs.\n \nSECTION 4 5.  That the purchase and distribution of food and beverage corresponding to the program’s activities are deemed to serve a public purpose for the reasons stated in the Explanation portion of this ordinance, and that up to $2,400.00 of the total expenditure authorized in Section 3 may be expended on food and non-alcoholic beverages.\n \nSECTION 5 6.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6 7.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 7 8.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
