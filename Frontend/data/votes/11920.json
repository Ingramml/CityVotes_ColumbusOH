    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & Dehaven, Inc. for the Sanitary Pump Station Evaluation & Upgrade Program, CIP #650660-100000, in an amount up to $300,000.00.\n \nDOSD operates sixteen Stormwater Pump Stations and sixteen Sanitary Pump Stations.  A Request for Proposals was issued in 2021 and the Sanitary Pump Stations contract was awarded to Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & Dehaven, Inc.  The contract work is to perform a holistic evaluation of each pump station; assess their structural, mechanical, process, electrical, and I&C components; identify needs and improvements; and identify risks and safety issues.  The evaluation and assessments for each pump station will be summarized into a Technical Memorandum (TM). The recommended improvements listed in the Technical Memorandums will be refined into Improvement Plans that will be used by the City to systematically upgrade the pump stations.\n \nThese Sanitary Pump Stations serve multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $300,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                               $300,000.00  (Ord. 3108-2021; PO308140)\nModification #1:                                                         $300,000.00 (Ord. 1606-2023; PO402543)\nModification #2 (current)                                           $300,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Modifications):                               $900,000.00\n \n1.2 Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe funding provided by this contract modification is for the continuation of existing and planned work of the project. Due to the highly complex and technical nature of this project, it is not reasonable or cost effective to undertake a new procurement to acquire these services. The lengthy process for initiating a new procurement and for a new entity to gain understanding of the project would cause an unacceptable project delay and additional cost.\n \n1.3 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe tasks for this modification are similar to the tasks of the Original Agreement; so, the costs of this Modification are similar to the Original Agreement.\n \n1.4 Timeline:\nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & Dehaven, Inc. began their work after the Notice to Proceed (NTP) was given on 1/27/22.  The duration of the engineering agreement was expected to last at least three years with services funded by incremental appropriation.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe performance of this projects’ activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s Sanitary Pump Stations is needed to plan improvements to maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the sewer collection systems and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & Dehaven, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006560 and expires 10/2/26.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of sub consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 15.13%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, Inc.has proposed the following two subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                               City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nResource International                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                                   WBE\nDynotec, Inc.                                                                   Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\n \nThe certification of Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns, and Dehaven, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
