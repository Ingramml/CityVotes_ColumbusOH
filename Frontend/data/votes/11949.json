    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Ironsite, Inc. for the Whetstone Sports Field Improvements Project. The modification amount is $1,297,000.00, with a contingency of $200,000.00, for a total of $1,497,000.00. An additional $3,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,500,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nAs part of this modification, the pond liner will be replaced, the stone edging around the pond will be reset, and the stream culvert to where the pond overflow is directed will be renovated. The open air shelter will also be replaced, a new well will be drilled, and the old well will be renovated. Additionally, this modification will create an interactive play area and a designated hammock grove. The well will also require Columbus Recreation and Parks to supply additional electrical feed to the back side of the pond from the existing transformer behind the maintenance facility located at the park. The sports fields, expected to open in fall 2025, will be accessed through the pond area in the park. The goal is to complete the pond improvements prior to the sports fields opening.\n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $1,500,00.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: This modification is needed because, during summer of 2024 after the project was already underway, it was discovered that the pond liner was cracked and the pond will currently not stay at its normal capacity, creating an urgent need to replace this liner. It was not anticipated at the time this contract was started that additional services would be necessary as it was unknown that the liner was cracked until the pond was evaluated during the project.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: A separate procurement process would be detrimental to the project as it is in progress. The contractor is already mobilized on-site and has completed the seeding of the sports fields, making the drilling of a new well to supply water to the newly seeded sports fields by April of 2025 crucial to the survival of the seed. These urgent needs make this modification necessary\n \nHow The Price For the Additional Services Was Determined: Pricing was determined using existing unit pricing from the original contract.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nIronsite, Inc.\n72 Holmes Street\nGalena, Ohio 43021  \nChris Allen, (380) 234-9550 \nContract Compliance Number: 005926\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 16, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested because the pond liner was cracked during the summer of 2024 and it will currently not stay at its normal capacity, creating an urgent need to replace the liner and drill a new well to supply water to the newly seeded sports fields.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will improve the existing fields, creating high quality sports fields for community leagues and tournaments.\nCommunity Input/Issues: The residents and soccer leagues that utilize these fields have requested that the flooding problems that have impacted play be eliminated through direct contact with departmental staff. Adding new amenities to this area were also requested. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Clintonville (39)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving sports fields and improving five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,645,471.55 was legislated for the Whetstone Field Improvements Project contract by Ordinance 1029-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $1,500,000.00. $1,500,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $3,145,471.55.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Ironsite, Inc. for the Whetstone Sports Field Improvements Project; to authorize the appropriation of $1,500,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the transfer of $1,500,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $1,500,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; and to declare an emergency.
