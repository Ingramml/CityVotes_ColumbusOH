    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Human Resources to enter into a services contract with Indigo Co. LLC in the amount of up to $400,000.00 for Design, Print, and Mail Services.\n \nFor over two decades, United HealthCare (UHC) has been the healthcare provider for the City of Columbus.  During this time, the City of Columbus has received an annual wellness credit to promote wellness initiatives and programs for our employees.  In 2024, the Department of Human Resources requested to receive the wellness credit via check instead of UHC paying the invoices related to our wellness-related initiatives.  United HealthCare approved this request and sent us the funding.  The money the Department of Human Resources received was deposited in the Employee Benefits Fund.\n \nFor multiple years, the Department of Human Resources used UHC wellness credits to pay Indigo Co. LLC for design, print, and mail services as they are a registered vendor and have the necessary permissions to handle the data of United HealthCare and the City of Columbus data.  In 2024, supplemental funding was not appropriated before fiscal year-end during the UHC wellness credit transition period.  Additionally, services have been rendered during this transition period and before the Columbus City Council passed the 2025 operating budget on 2/10/2025.\n \nThe Department of Human Resources requests to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 to enter into a contract with Indigo Co. LLC.  Indigo Co. LLC has institutional knowledge, experience, and permissions with the City of Columbus and United HealthCare data.  The Department of Human Resources must also pay outstanding invoices for services rendered during the UHC wellness credit transition period.  Indigo Co. LLC did not invoice the department for services rendered until February 2025.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Indigo Co. LLC.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nIndigo Co. LLC’s contract compliance number is WBE-002408 and expires on 3/26/2026.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 5502, the Employee Benefits Fund.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so Indigo Co. LLC can receive outstanding payments, and the department to provide the City of Columbus employees with important benefits and wellness documentation as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Human Resources to enter into a services contract with Indigo Co. LLC for the Design, Print, and Mail Service contract; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of up to $400,000.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency. ($400,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need to enter into a services contract to provide Design, Print, and Mail Services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code relating to competitive bidding in this situation due to Indigo Co. LLC’s institutional knowledge and experience with our department and permissions with the City of Columbus and United HealthCare data, and to pay outstanding invoices for services rendered during the UHC wellness credit transition period.\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to enter into a contract with Indigo Co. LLC for the provision of services described above in the amount of up to $400,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $400,000.00 from Fund 5502, the Employee Benefits Fund, to pay for the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Human Resources to enter into a contract with Indigo Co. LLC to provide funding for the Design, Print, and Mail Services so that services may continue without further disruption, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Human Resources be, and hereby is, authorized to enter into a professional services contract with Indigo Co. LLC, 5059 Turner Close, New Albany, OH 43054, for the Design, Print, and Mail Services contract in an amount up to $400,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $400,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 5502 (Employee Benefits Fund), Dept-Div 4601 (Human Resources), in Object Class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That Council finds it in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
