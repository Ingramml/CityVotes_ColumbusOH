    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Decker Construction Company for the 2022 Utility Cut Project.\n \nThere are various types of utility excavations that need to be performed within the City of Columbus' right-of-way and City owned properties by the Department of Public Utilities. The restoration work typically involves repair of existing pavement, curbs, and sidewalks in a manner conforming to the City of Columbus, Construction and Material Specifications (CMSC). The Department routinely outsources this restoration work to a contractor that is equipped and trained to make these repairs. Typical types of restoration work that require outsourcing involve the installation of wheelchair ramps, asphalt repair involving thermal bond heat weld repairs, asphalt milling machines capable of full width milling, and the delivery of flowable controlled density fill using volumetric mixer trucks.\n \nOrdinance 3224-2022, authorized the original contract but was not specific in the details regarding the length of time the multi-year renewal term was authorized to achieve transparency about the length of the contract at its inception. Since the number and length of the renewals allowed was not specified in the original ordinance, we are requesting authorization for a new contract that covers the 2025 operating year. This contract shall not automatically renew. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding or a contract date extension, a modification would be requested.\n \nPrincipal Party:\nDecker Construction Company\n3040 McKinley Avenue\nColumbus, OH 43204\nCarl Scheiderer, (614) 488-7958\nContract Compliance Number: 004549\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 03, 2025\n \nProcurement:  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids through Vendor Services and Bid Express from October 11th, 2022 to November 9th, 2022, for the 2022 Utility Cut Project in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code, RFQ023112.
