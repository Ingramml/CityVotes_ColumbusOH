    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the amendment of Ordinance 1564-2024 which was approved by City Council on July 5, 2024 to reduce the funding amount previously authorized within the 2023 HOME grant funds, as well as authorizes the expenditure in an amount up to $100,613.00 from the 2018 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, restrictive covenant, and authorizes the city to act as a lender for this project with the Homes on the Hill Community Development Corporation. The project is to develop and construct a single family housing unit at 120 N. Eureka Ave., that was recently from the City of Columbus Land Bank.  \n \nOrdinance 1564-2024 approved by City Council on July 5, 2024, authorized the Director of Development to support the development of the single housing unit at 120 N. Eureka Ave., in an amount of up to $270,201.00 of 2023 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) funding. Ordinance 1564-2024 will need to be amended to reduce the funded amount from the 2023 HOME grant funds in the amount of ($79,487.00) which will bring the total funded amount for the project utilizing 2023 HOME grant funds to be in an amount of $190,714.00.   The reason for this reduction is that through the reconciliation process 2018 HOME grant funds were identified and can be utilized for this project.  Therefore, this ordinance is authorizing the amount that was reduced from the 2023 grant funding ($79,487.00) as well as  an additional request of funding in an amount up to $21,126.00 for a total amount of 2018 grant funding of $100,613.00 and a total funded amount for the overall project in an amount up to $291,327.00.  The need for the additional HOME funding is due to the post construction appraisal was valued higher than anticipated thus creating a larger affordability gap and the additional need of funding to close that gap.   The commitment letter and loan documents have not yet been executed. \nThe funding of this project will address the need for affordable housing in the City of Columbus for low-income families that are at or below 80% of the Area Median Income limits set by HUD.  This project will add decent, safe, and sanitary housing to the Hilltop Neighborhood, located in the Greater Hilltop Area of Columbus.  The increased availability of safe and stable housing in Columbus promotes the health and well-being of the neighborhood and the citizens living in the neighborhood. \nWe are funding this project with the Homes on the Hill Community Development Corporation, who is a Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) in partnership with the City of Columbus.  Homes on the Hill will use HOME CHDO set-aside funds to develop the 120 N. Eureka Avenue project on land purchased from the Land Bank. \nHomes on the Hill Community Development Organization was founded in 1993 with the mission to be the exemplary housing counseling and development organization in Central Ohio.\n \nWith the construction of a new, single-family home at 120 N. Eureka Avenue, the Homes on the Hill Community Development Organization is investing in and providing affordable housing to the Hilltop  neighborhood.  The two-story, single family home will consist of three bedrooms, two and a half bathrooms, a basement, a garage, and will be built to City AWARE standards.  The home will be sold to a first-time homebuyer earning at or below 80% of the Area Median Income as defined by HUD. \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2018 and 2023 Action Plan per ordinance numbers 2589-2017 and 3353-2022 respectively. \n \nEmergency Designation:  An emergency exists as this gap in funding due to the appraisal prevents the closing on this house.  The more time that this home sits vacant the possibility of vandalism increases and the future homeowner could face further financial hardships for not closing on the property timely.  \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 005144 and expires 08/01/2026\n \nFiscal Impact: $291,327.00 is available from the 2022 HOME grant (G451801) and 2023 HOME grant (G442202) funds.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the amendment of Ordinance 1564-2024 which was approved by City Council on July 5, 2024 to reduce the funding amount of the 2023 HOME Investment Partnerships Program grant funding in an mount up to ($79,487.00) as well as authorizes the expenditure in an amount up to $100,613.00 of 2018 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant funds of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, restrictive covenant, and authorizes the city to act as a lender for this project with the Homes on the Hill Community Development Corporation to construct a single family home in an amount up to $291,317.00; and declare emergency.
