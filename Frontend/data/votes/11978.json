    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Directors of the Departments of Technology and Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Labworks, LLC, to provide maintenance and support services of the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The original agreement (EL008929) was authorized by ordinance 1738-2008, passed November 24, 2008. The most recent and existing contract was authorized pursuant to Ordinance 0585-2024, passed March 25, 2024, establishing PO444594, for software maintenance and support services which covered the period from June 1, 2024, through May 31, 2025.  This contract will provide software maintenance and support services for the term period from June 1, 2025, through May 31, 2026, at a cost of $66,963.00.\n \nLIMS enables the Division of Sewer and Drainage (DOSD) and the Division of Water (DOW) to manage water quality sample information, incorporate input from plant operations data sources, track over 79,000 tests on 16,000 different samples annually, and transfer approved results reporting requirements more efficiently. This annual maintenance and support agreement is needed to provide the updated LIMS software and access to LIMS technical support. Without this agreement, the City would need to pay a substantially higher new license fee to obtain the latest version of LIMS software, and would be unable to resolve problems with the software requiring LIMS technical support. \n \nThis ordinance also requests approval to continue services provided by Labworks, LLC, in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; as it has been determined that Labworks, LLC is the sole distributor of LIMS, and does not utilize distributors or resellers due to the complex nature of its product. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nIn 2023 and 2024, $60,453.00 and $63,744.00, respectively, was legislated for software maintenance and support services to support the Laboratory Information System (LIMS). This year (2025), this ordinance will authorize the expenditure of $66,963.00. Funds have been identified and are available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Fund. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: Labworks, LLC      \nCertification: EBO_CC- 017617 \nExpiration: February 16, 2026\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology and the Director of the Department of Utilities to enter into a contract with Labworks, LLC, for maintenance and support of the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Columbus City Code; and to authorize the expenditure $66,963.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund.
