    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nOn October 3, 2012, the Columbus City Treasurer's Office issued a request for proposal for various banking services among which was merchant processing services.\n \nHuntington Merchant Services was awarded the contract for merchant processing.  On May 6, 2013, Columbus City Council authorized contracts and expenditures for the first year of banking services, for the period of June 1, 2013, through May 31, 2014.  On February 14, 2022, Ordinance 0374-2022 was passed by Columbus City Council which authorized the tenth year of a ten-year renewal of banking services with Huntington Merchant Services for the period from June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023.\n \nThe City Treasurer’s Office, in collaboration with the City Auditor’s Office and the Department of Finance and Management, developed a banking RFP with an expansion of the services beyond traditional banking.\n \nGateway services, which facilitate the city’s on-line payments, are currently under contract until March 1, 2026, subject to annual appropriation and approval by Columbus City Council.  The award of merchant processing services included gateway services and, as a consequence, more time for the transition to the new banking partner was needed.  Huntington Merchant Services agreed to extend the current terms and conditions of the contract awarded in 2013 for the period of the modification of a year from May 31, 2023, to May 31, 2024, with a one-year option to renew the term.\n \nOn February 26, 2024, Columbus City Council authorized the City Treasurer to exercise the one-year option to renew the term of the agreement through May 31, 2025, and add the necessary funding on behalf of city agencies taking credit cards with passage of Ordinance 0484-2024.\n \nThere has been enormous progress in transitioning the city’s merchants to the new merchant contract with JP Morgan Chase, however it is likely that more time will be needed for a few remaining merchants.  The City Treasurer now requests Columbus City Council to authorize an extension of the Huntington Merchant Services contract through March 1, 2026.  This term will coincide with the end date of the gateway under contract with First Data.  Huntington Merchant Services has agreed to extend the term of the agreement.\n \nEmergency designation is requested so that the provision of credit card processing services is uninterrupted.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNo funds are required for this ordinance.\n \nContract Compliance:  Huntington Merchant Services, 113328074, expiration 5/10/2025\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to extend its contract for banking services with Huntington Merchant Services through March 1, 2026; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer proposed the award of contracts for banking services as provided for in an RFP issued on October 3, 2012, for which the Columbus City Council authorized the contract and expenditures for merchant processing to Huntington Merchant Services for the first year on May 6, 2013; and\n \nWHEREAS, contracts for the tenth year of a ten-year contract for banking services were authorized by Columbus City Council for the period of June 1, 2022, through May 31, 2023, on February 14, 2022, with passage of Ordinance 0374-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council authorized the Treasurer’s Office to extend its contract with Huntington Merchant Services for merchant processing beyond its original ten-year term (from the current end date of May 31, 2023, to May 31, 2024 with an option for a one-year renewal at the existent terms and conditions) with passage of Ordinance 2580-2022 to accommodate the expansion of banking to include gateway services for on-line payments; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council authorized the City Treasurer to exercise its option to renew its contract with Huntington Merchant Services and extend its term to May 31, 2025, with passage of Ordinance 0484-2024 on February 26, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer now requests that Columbus City Council authorize an extension of its contract with Huntington Merchant Services and extend its term to March 1, 2026, to ensure that all city merchants have made the transition to the city’s new merchant services provider; and\n \nWHEREAS, as an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of various city divisions in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Treasurer to extend its contract with Huntington Merchant Services for the daily operation of normal business activities of the City of Columbus thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
