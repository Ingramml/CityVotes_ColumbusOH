    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: In 1984, the City responded to concerns raised by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regarding potential exposures to employees at the City’s trash burning power plant. The City began testing employees at the Columbus Department of Health.  In particular, the Occupational Safety and Health Clinic provided medical surveillance examinations, pre-placement examinations, immunizations, health and fitness assessments, clearance for respirator wear, assessment of workers’ fitness for duty, consultation, hearing conservation training, and audiometric testing.\n \nIn 2006, Columbus Public Health restructured its focus from internal safety assessments to monitoring community health status, public health threats, and preventing/controlling disease.  The City then shifted the operations of employee occupational safety and health medical services from Columbus Public Health to the Department of Human Resources.  This was done in an effort to provide focused and coordinated occupational safety and health medical services in accordance with the Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), OSHA, and the State Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC).\n \nCurrently, the Occupational Safety and Health Clinic provides surveillance exams and appropriate follow up to at risk City employees, identifies occupational related disease or disability, assists in rehabilitation activities, determines fitness and suitability for assigned work, and promotes and maintains PERRP/OSHA compliance.  The Clinic also promotes employee health, wellness, and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease/injury, providing assistance in injury care activities and rehabilitation activities, and providing educational and training programs promoting employee wellness and safe work practices.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes and directs the Human Resources Director to enter into contract with Mount Carmel Health Systems for occupational safety and health medical services for the City of Columbus.  In addition, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure and establishes a maximum obligation liability of $360,000.00 to be paid from the employee benefits fund. The contract dates are from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022.  \n \nThis contract was successfully re-bid in September, 2016; this ordinance represents the fifth year of a five year contract.  Following the fifth year, the contract allows for three one year extensions if all parties are in agreement.  Every year the contract renewal is subject to available appropriation and funding.  \n \nContract Compliance:  Contract compliance number is 31-1439334.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order that occupational safety and health medical services may continue without disruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding for this contract totals $360,000.00 and is budgeted in the 2021 employee benefits fund budget.  As stated above, this is the fifth year of a five year contract, which allows for three one year extensions following the fifth year.  Every year, contract renewal is subject to available and adequate appropriation and funding. This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2021 Other Funds operating budget, Ordinance 2503-2020. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Human Resources to enter into contract with Mount Carmel Health Systems to provide all eligible employees occupational safety and health medical services from March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022; to authorize the expenditure of $360,000.00 from the employee benefits fund, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay the costs of said contract; and to declare an emergency.  ($360,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to enter into contract with Mount Carmel Health Systems to provide all eligible employees occupational safety and health medical services from March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the current contract is for a five year period, with three one-year extensions possible, subject to sufficient appropriation; and \n \nWHEREAS, this contract represents the fifth year of the current contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $360,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay contract costs for occupational safety and health medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with Mount Carmel Occupational Health and Wellness for continuity of services, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare, now, therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Human Resources is hereby authorized to enter into contract with Mount Carmel Occupational Health and Wellness to provide occupational safety and health medical services and related Education and Wellness Programs to all eligible employees from March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of up to $360,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized in the employee benefits fund 5502 in object class 03 Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage, if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
