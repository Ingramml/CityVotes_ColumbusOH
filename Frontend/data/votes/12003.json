The contract began upon issuance of a notice to proceed with the term continuing until completion of work.  Ordinance 0695-2021 authorized the modification of the contract to cover the cost of work to support and maintain the Connected Vehicle Control Center software.  Ordinance 1203-2022 authorized the transfer of signature authority from the Chief Innovation Officer to the Director of Public Service and the modification of the contract to cover the continued cost of work to support and maintain the Connected Vehicle Control Center software.  Ordinance 0747-2024 authorized the modification of the contract to cover the continued cost of work to support and maintain the Connected Vehicle Control Center software.\n \nThis planned contract modification is needed to maintain and operate the Columbus Connected Vehicle Environment at over 85 traffic signals that provide and receive information for safety applications currently active for the over 1,000 vehicles; 313 private owner, 383 COTA vehicles, 300 City vehicles, and 17 freight vehicles.  Over $7 million of investment was put into the Connected Vehicle Environment project and has always been planned to be maintained after the Smart Columbus grant period expires.  This modification lasts into 2026.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended:                       $125,000.00\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $1,050,000.00  (PO185823, Ord. 1312-2019) \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $150,000.00     (PO266702, Ord. 0695-2021) \nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                $150,000.00     (PO328332, Ord. 1203-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                      $130,000.00     (PO441857, Ord 0747-2024)\nThe total of Modification No. 4:                                                                      $125,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                         $1,605,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to allow additional resources to cover the continued cost of work to support and maintain the Connected Vehicle Control Center software.  The cost to support and maintain the software is an annual expense rather than a one-time payment.  This modification will allow continued maintenance and support of the Connected Vehicle Control Center software, which is necessary to monitor and control the Smart Columbus Connected Vehicle Environment Roadside Units along High Street, Morse Road, Cleveland Avenue and Alum Creek.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe current contract utilizes specialized software that was designed and managed by the current vendor, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the cost of software support and maintenance established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Kapsch.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Kapsch TrafficCom USA, Inc. is CC028572 and expires 3/22/2026.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is budgeted, available, and appropriated within Fund 2265, the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund.  \n \n4.
