    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of Latino Heritage Month is to celebrate the culture of Latin Americans and emphasize their significant contributions to the City of Columbus. National Latino Heritage Month occurs from September 15 until October 15 annually. The Latino Heritage Month Committee was formed out of the office of Councilmember Lourdes Barroso de Padilla in Fall 2022 to promote visibility, cultural awareness, and togetherness during Latino Heritage Month in hopes of creating lasting impact in the Greater Columbus community. This year, programming will consist of a parade, art show, and a \"know your rights\" workshop.\n \nThe Office of Councilmember Barroso de Padilla has identified a local nonprofit, Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio, as the fiscal manager for purposes of planning and programming this year's Latino Heritage Festival. This organization is dedicated to supporting and promoting Ohio writers at all stages of their careers so they can develop their talent, share their work, and contribute to the literary community. They work to achieve this objective through specialized programs, events, and resources. As the fiscal manager for Council's support of Latino Heritage Month, they will distribute funds to pay for services associated with services such as event planning and social media engagement.\n \nThe not-for-profit service contract will include a fee (15%) to Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio for administrative expenses. To ensure that funds are disbursed in an expedient manner, the Clerk shall issue all funds associated with this ordinance to Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio in advance of Latino Heritage Month-related program administration and fund disbursement. Funds awarded by Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio shall be made up-front to vendors in advance of the services they will render related to Latino Heritage Month.\n \nEmergency: Emergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in planning Latino Heritage Month events.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund and the General Fund. Additional funding may be made available and, if so, will necessitate an amendment.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio on behalf of the Latino Heritage Month Committee in support of their Latino Heritage Month events; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize an expenditure from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
