    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with MKSK Inc. to provide professional services associated with the parkland design for the Case Road Park Project. The contract amount is $217,419.00, with a contingency of $18,406.00, for a total of $235,825.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nIn 2018, Recreation and Parks acquired the former Ohio State University Agriculture Extension Sheep Farm at 2425 West Case Road.  For several years, the Department had identified the 58 acre site as a key potential community park space, as the parcel is one of the largest remaining undeveloped open spaces in the entire Northwest Community.   At the same time, the surrounding neighborhoods have played an active role by providing support for the city’s investment to buy the site and develop a signature green space for a highly underserved area for greenspace.  The property is surrounded by high density housing, with over 1,000 households within a 10 minute walk.  The Carriage Place Community Center is also within 200 yards of the parkland.\n \nThis contract will complete the Master Planning Phase and preliminary design of this project. This phase will engage the surrounding neighborhoods to determine preferred layouts and amenities, obtain a detailed site inventory, develop preliminary engineering and cost estimates, and select priority construction items to open the park to the public.  In early 2022, upon successful completion of this Master Plan and the selection of the first phase of improvements design, the department will request a contract modification to create final contract documents for construction. Improvements under consideration for this new park development project include, but are not limited to, athletic fields, walking paths, play space, community shelter(s), parking areas, natural areas, tree preservation, and walking path connections to surrounding neighborhoods.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 25, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 16, 2020.  Proposals were received from the following firms:\n \nLatus Studio (MAJ)\nMKSK Inc. (MAJ)\nImplement LLC                      (MAJ)\nGPD Group (MAJ)\nPOD Design (MAJ)\nMannik Smith Group (MAJ)                                                               \n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor were they part of this evaluation. \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended that MKSK Inc. be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nMKSK Inc., Inc.\n462 Ludlow Alley, Columbus, OH  43215\nBrian Kinzelman, (614) 621-2796\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 028341, 83-2731940\nNovember 24, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested due to the timeframe required to engage the public, perform the necessary site inventory, and complete the conceptual design by the end of 2021. Also, the environmental survey of the property needs to be completed and submitted for permitting review in July of 2021.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Case Road Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the entire Northwest region of Columbus. The scale of the park will accommodate a wide range of passive and active recreation for all ages. It will be easily accessible to over 1,000 households nearby.  The park will be designed to maximize walking and biking access, taking advantage of the close proximity of Carriage Place Community Center.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since 2017, the local communities have been extensively engaged with Recreation and Parks in the acquisition and development of this greenspace. The department has engaged with the Northwest Civic Association, Ohio State University, Don Scott Airport, nearby civic groups, and residents surrounding the parkland.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northwest (34)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks and trails while adding easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $235,825.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with MKSK Inc. to provide professional services associated with the park land design for the Case Road Park Project; to authorize the transfer of $235,825.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the expenditure of $235,825.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
