    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into contract with OpportunitySpace, Inc. for the Tolemi BuildingBlocks software platform. Last year, City Council passed several housing initiatives including Vacant Registry, Foreclosure Registry and Wholesaler Registry. This software tool is necessary for the Department to effectively manage these registries and monitor the properties. Using up-to-date data such as utility usage, USPS mail delivery, and code violations, the software platform will proactively identify vacant properties before they become blighted. Furthermore, the software will monitor pre-foreclosure and foreclosure filings to give a complete view of properties in financial distress. \n \nThe Tolemi BuildingBlocks software tool differs from other property registry software by offering a map-based analytics approach that integrates data from various sources to provide comprehensive insights into property conditions. Specifically, it will provide automated integration of these data sources at regular intervals to ensure the information contained within the application is up-to-date, process automation based on internal city and county data, with the capability to run advanced spatial queries outside of GIS software, and give user-generated reports and performance metrics across all data sources contained in the application.\n \nThis will allow the City to proactively manage distressed properties (i.e., vacant or foreclosed) and to assess vacancy risks and nuisances more effectively. The Tolemi BuildingBlocks software platform, when combined with the Slate application, is a proprietary product, developed and sold exclusively by OpportunitySpace, Inc., therefore, this contract will be entered into under the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes. This is a three year contract subject to annual approval and authorization by City Council and other City officials\n \nThe Department of Building and Zoning Services reviewed several other software programs relating to registering vacant and foreclosed properties, but their focus is on compliance and process management.  These help in categorizing and managing properties based on vacancy/foreclosure/rental status, but does not provide analytical capabilities that are needed to assist the Department in effectively managing the properties that are included in the above mentioned registries. Furthermore, the software platform allows the City to add a Wholesaler registry component. In addition, OppotunitySpace, Inc. is capable of working with the City’s banking partner to deposit fees directly to the City’s account.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to expedite authorization of this contract so that the Department can fulfill its requirements of registering vacant and foreclosed properties and wholesaler applicants as quickly as possible now that the budget has passed.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\n \nContract Compliance\nVendor: OpportunitySpace, Inc. \nCertification #:  CC-023594 - Exp:  01/03/2027\nThe company is not disbarred according to the excluded party listing system of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved finding for recovery certified search.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe price of the BuildingBlocks software and support for the first year is $178,000.  After the initial set up, the annual price will be reduced to approximately $149,000.
