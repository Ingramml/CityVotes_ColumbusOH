The City holds a municipal license which covers events at facilities owned and/or operated by the city and any site engaged by the city for use by the city. In addition to Recreation and Parks’ programs and facilities, coverage is extended to: Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration, Columbus Commons productions, Veterans’ Day Parade, King Arts Complex, Lincoln Theatre, Franklin Park Conservatory, Columbus Zoo and all other city conducted programs and facilities that play or present music. Recreation and Parks will expend $35,000.00 for annual licenses.\nA grant process for community events and festivals has existed since 1995 to support community groups and neighbors that host free events celebrating cultural, ethnic, and artistic diversity for the entertainment and enjoyment by the greater Columbus community.
