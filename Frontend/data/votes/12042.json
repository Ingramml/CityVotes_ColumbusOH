    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Marker Construction, LLC for the Marion Franklin Pool Replacement Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $3,000,000.00.\n \nAfter serving the City of Columbus for more than fifty years, the pools at Marion Franklin and Tuttle Parks need to be replaced to function in an efficient and safe manner. Work will start at the Marion Franklin location in 2025 with early procurements of electrical and plumbing components in spring of 2025. Demolition of the Marion Franklin Pool will begin at the conclusion of the 2025 swim season and re-open for the 2026 swim season. A modification for additional work will be requested to perform renovations at the Tuttle Park Pool in 2026 and re-open in 2027. The work at both locations is similar to the pool renovation projects at Glenwood and Windsor Parks, which underwent complete renovations in 2022. At Marion Franklin, the existing swimming pool will be replaced. A new multiple feature leisure pool and updates to the existing bath house will also be included. The new pools will improve the accessibility for all ability levels. The project will also meet the requests that were received as part of the public outreach phase of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan.\n \nBoth of these facilities are well past their useful life expectancy. Swimming pools have shown to improve the quality of life in a community. The City of Columbus’s aquatic facilities offer opportunities for people to learn how to swim, have access to physical activity, and to relieve the stress associated with hot summer weather.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department proposes to deliver this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) contract. Using this method will allow for the early procurement of long lead time materials, which will keep the project on schedule. The plans are currently ninety percent complete and materials are ready to be procured. This early material procurement helps in shortening the overall project schedule which translates to project cost savings. This contract will be modified in the future to include the remainder of the Guaranteed Maximum Price for the project.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 24, 2025 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 14, 2025.
