    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with numerous not-for-profit, social service agencies for the third and final year of the department’s Elevate! 2.0 program. See attached Exhibit A for the list of 60 not-for-profit social services agencies included in this ordinance. The total amount awarded to these agencies is $4,570,000.00. The term of each Grant Agreement shall be a 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025. This legislation authorizes the transfer and expenditure in an amount up to $3,492,000.00 within the Emergency Human Services Fund and the appropriation and expenditure in an amount up to $1,078,000.00 within the Income Tax Set Aside Fund for these agreements.\n \nColumbus, renowned as America's Opportunity City, remains a beacon of potential and hope for its residents. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the population faces challenges stemming from personal, societal, structural, and economic factors, which impede their full participation in the city's myriad opportunities. Acknowledging the complexity of these challenges, the City is committed to implementing a comprehensive solution and is responsible for driving transformative changes to establish equitable opportunities for all residents.\n \nThe Elevate! Initiative plays a pivotal role in effecting this transformative change. This initiative has allocated funding to support 112 distinct non-profit organizations categorized into two programs, denoted as 1.0 and 2.0, collectively addressing 16 of the 21 aspirations outlined in The Mayor’s Opportunity Rising. Through various means, the Elevate! Initiative promotes and provides opportunities for collaboration, learning, and resource-sharing among member agencies, ensuring that every community member they serve can access the services needed based upon their unique circumstance.\n \nThe Elevate! 2.0 NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability) was made available to local not-for-profit organizations from September 12, 2022, to October 3, 2022. The Department received 142 applications, requesting a total funding of $14,050,000.00, which were reviewed by a 24-member team. Sixty-four programs were selected for funding in 2023, marking the inaugural year of the three-year Elevate! 2.0 program. For the third and final year Sixty programs have been selected for funding.  \n \nFunding will be advanced to each agency on a predetermined schedule. Advancement of funds is needed because many of the organizations do not have funding available to be reimbursed for program expenses. The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order. Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the grant agreement. Additionally, these programs/grant agreements may include reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of the programs (e.g., Mid-Ohio Foodbank) which the expenditure is hereby deemed to be a valid public purpose in that such purchase will address the immediate needs of program participants.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these agreements have been allocated  within the Emergency Human Services Fund 2025 budget (Fund 2231), up to $3,492,000.00, and the Income Tax Set Aside (ITSA) Subfund 100099, in an amount up to $1,078,000.00. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: See attached Exhibit A for a list of social services agencies and the vendor registration and contract compliance data.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute grant agreements with numerous not-for-profit, social service agencies in an amount up to $4,570,000.00 for the Elevate! 2.0 Program; to authorize the provision of services for 12-month periods beginning January 1, 2025; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; and to authorize the transfer between object classes and the expenditure in an amount up to $3,492,000.00 within the Emergency Human Services Fund, and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of funds an amount up to $1,078,000.00 within the Income Tax Set Aside Fund.
