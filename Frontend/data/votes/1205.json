    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Cargill, Inc. for the purchase of one AccuBrine NXT-Gen brine maker for the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management.  The Division of Infrastructure Management will use it to make brine to improve various roadways in Columbus during the winter seasons.\nThe Department of Public Service started utilizing AccuBrine automated equipment at our newly constructed sites.  This equipment was selected for a number of reasons, and contains proprietary and protected processes not available on other brine making equipment.  As existing equipment at other sites reaches end of life, it is in the department’s best interest to replace it with the same equipment being installed at the new sites.  This is important for a number of reasons.  The first being availability of parts. It is not economical to stock parts for multiple manufacturers, and the majority of the parts are not interchangeable. Having parts on hand for rapid repair of equipment during snow events is a necessity.  The ability to manage software and service through one service contract as opposed to multiple streamlines our operations as well.  Driver and operator training is also a reason for maintaining one type of equipment.  Drivers may be using equipment at several different sites during snow events.  The equipment needs to have uniform function and programming to avoid confusion and misuse of equipment.  \nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure is requesting to waive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329, enter directly into contract with Cargill, Inc., and to establish a purchase order with Cargill, Inc. to purchase the AccuBrine NXT-Gen brine maker.  \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Cargill, Inc. \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nThe contract compliance number for Cargill, Inc. is CC007812 and expires on 8/20/2022.\n \n3. FISCAL IMPACT\nThis is a budgeted expense within the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure the Division of Infrastructure Management receives the AccuBrine brine maker as soon as possible so the division has it in place before the 2021-2022 winter season to improve roadways for the public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management, to enter into contract with Cargill, Inc. for an AccuBrine NXT-Gen brine maker to improve the roadways of Columbus during the winter months; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329; to authorize the expenditure of $194,865.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, and to declare an emergency.  ($194,865.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management needs to purchase an AccuBrine NXT-Gen brine maker to improve the roadways of Columbus during the winter seasons; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the department started utilizing AccuBrine automated equipment at our newly constructed sites; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the City's best interests to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 for purchases from Cargill, Inc. as existing equipment at other sites reaches end of life, it is in the department’s best interest to replace it with the same equipment being installed at the new sites; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds are available in the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair for this expense; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with Cargill, Inc. so that this brine maker can be put into service as quickly as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
