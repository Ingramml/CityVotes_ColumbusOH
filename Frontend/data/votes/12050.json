    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of the Franklin County Municipal Court, Clerk of Court (“Municipal Court Clerk”) to modify the existing contract with Dell Marketing LP for the support, hosting of the monthly Azure usage; to authorize the expenditure of up to $3,000.00, from the Municipal Court Clerk’s Computer Fund.\n \nThe Municipal Court Clerk is in the process of migrating the existing phone system to Microsoft Teams Voice. This legislation allows the Municipal Court Clerk to utilize the existing Azure licensing for monthly cloud storage of recorded phone data. To store recorded phone calls from Microsoft Teams Voice, cloud storage is required. This cloud storage is billed at a rate set by Microsoft. This legislation authorized blanket funds for these rates to be paid monthly. \n \n\n\n\nCloud Services\n\n$0.1170\n\nper hour\n\n\n\nApp Service\n\n$0.1000\n\nper hour\n\n\n\nAzure SQL Database\n\n$0.0202\n\nper hour\n\n\n\nStorage Accounts\n\n$21.0000\n\nper month\n\n\n\nWrite Operations\n\n$0.0720\n\nper 10K Operations\n\n\n\nRead Operations\n\n$0.0060\n\nper 10K Operations\n\n\n\nIR Read Operations\n\n$0.0060\n\nper 10K Operations\n\n\n\nIR Write Operations\n\n$0.0720\n\nper 100 Operations\n\n\n\nKey Vault Operations\n\n$0.0300\n\nper 10K Operations\n\n\n\nKV Advanced Operations\n\n$0.1500\n\nper 10K Operations\n\n\n\nKV Cert Renewal\n\n$3.0000\n\nper renewal\n\n\n\nKV Hardware Security\n\n$1.0000\n\nper key\n\n\n \n \n \nThis Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications.\n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds: The total amount needed for the modification is $3,000.00.
