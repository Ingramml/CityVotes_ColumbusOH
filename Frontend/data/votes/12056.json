These improvements will keep this tank in optimal condition and prolong its service life.  Regular maintenance inspections have determined that the Lazelle South tank exterior needs to be blasted and recoated at this time. The interior dry area and spots of the interior wet area coating systems also need to be blasted and recoated.  The project will include various safety improvements such as fall protection tie-off lugs on the roof and a rooftop handrail opening safety gate. Special consideration towards environmentally friendly operations will be implemented, one of which is the recycling of the Garnet abrasive blast media, which results in significantly reducing the volume of waste sent to the landfill.\n \nCommunity planning areas: 32 - Far North\n \nTIMELINE:                       Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 180 days from the date that a Notice To Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice To Proceed on or about May 2025.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $2,744,995.00, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost Summary:\n \nOriginal Contract                     $2,744,995.00                                          \nFuture Anticipated Needs                     $            0.00\n       CONTRACT TOTAL                     $2,744,995.00\nPrevailing Wage Charges                     $      2,000.00                                           \n                     $2,746,995.00                     \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThese improvements will keep this tank in optimal condition and prolong its service life.  Special consideration towards environmentally friendly operations will be implemented, one of which is the recycling of the Garnet abrasive blast media, which results in significantly reducing the volume of waste sent to the landfill.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 1/21/26 through 2/26/25.  Four bids were received for the project and were opened on 2/26/25.  The following companies submitted bids:\n \n\n\n\nName\n\nBid Amount\n\nCity/State\n\nStatus\n\n\n\nViking Industrial Painting\n\n$2,744,995.00\n\nOmaha, NE\n\nMAJ\n\n\n\nClearcreek Coatings \n\n$2,970,109.78\n\nNew Carlisle, OH\n\nMAJ\n\n\n  D&M Painting                                                    $3,513,994.50        Washington, PA        MAJ\n  MW Cole Construction LLC*                              $1,678,850.00        The Villages, FL        MAJ\n \n*MW Cole Construction LLC submitted a bid withdrawal request that was approved due to a misunderstanding the scope of the job.\n \nThe Viking Painting, LLC bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $2,744,995.00.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nViking Painting, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC-051999 and expires 03/14/27.   \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.\nAs part of their proposal, Viking Painting, LLC, Inc. has proposed the following two subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                  ODI Certification Status \nColumbus Door Sales                                Columbus, Ohio                                      MAJ\nCorrpro                                                   Columbus, Ohio                                       MAJ\n \n6.
