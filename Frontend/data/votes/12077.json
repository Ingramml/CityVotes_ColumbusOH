    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the amendment to Ordinance No. 0377-2025, passed by City Council on March 24, 2025, to correctly reflect that the modification authorized applies to the contract with Ground Floor Growth LLC, a disregarded entity of Columbus Downtown Development Corp.  \n \nDowntown Ground Floor Growth Initiative (Program) (formally called the Downtown Commercial Marketplace Program) is a small business program that seeks to achieve multiple goals through one comprehensive program. The Program includes:\n•                     Providing downtown storefront space for small, local businesses who are oriented towards walk in customers (such as retail or restaurant businesses).\n•                     Providing a master lease holder to: 1) sublease to small, local businesses in a way that promotes their growth and gives them a safe place to land, and 2) rent vacant properties downtown and guarantee stability for the property owners of those spaces.\n•                     Providing technical assistance to the Program participants so that the businesses renting the downtown storefronts can grow and succeed.\n \nThis Program is designed to decrease vacancy downtown; promote small, local businesses; and promote the amenities of downtown as a neighborhood for Columbus residents living and working inside and outside of downtown.  Ground Floor Growth, LLC, whose sole member is the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC), will administer the master lease component of the program.  The City does not have the human resources to administer the program through existing staffing. \n \nFurther, this amendment seeks to declare an emergency to ensure that there are no delays in the continuation of the program, which includes the second round of the program which cannot be completed without additional funding.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Columbus Downtown Development Corporation’s vendor number is 004795 and expires on 12/10/2026.  This contract will be entered into with Ground Floor Growth LLC with payment issued to Columbus Downtown Development Corporation.  The disregarded entity is listed within the vendor account.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 0377-2025, passed by Columbus City Council on March 24, 2025 to correctly reflect that the modification authorized applies to the contract with Ground Floor Growth LLC, a disregarded entity of Columbus Downtown Development Corp; and to declare an emergency.
