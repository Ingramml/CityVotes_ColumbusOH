    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Commission on Black Girls (Commission) has undertaken significant efforts to study and improve the quality of life for Black girls in central Ohio. Through listening sessions, focus groups, literature reviews, and expert analysis, the Commission developed a series of recommendations aimed at addressing disparities and promoting equity.\nThe Ohio State University (OSU) has partnered with the Commission to create a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention. This initiative targets justice-involved Black girls aged 14-17 and their caregivers, addressing trauma, PTSD, and associated behavioral challenges. By focusing on evidence-based interventions, this project seeks to reduce recidivism and improve participants’ mental and physical well-being. The interventions’ findings will also provide information about the impact of mindfulness-based practices on behavior when youth and caregivers practice together.  \nLegislation was previously passed for the purpose of entering a grant agreement with The Ohio State University for the MBSR intervention, because of the delay in fully executing the agreement with OSU this ordinance is needed to authorize the grant agreement which will allow OSU to be reimbursed for the work they have already performed, as well as continue with the intervention.   \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $26,929.00 with The Ohio State University, with authorization for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order, starting March 1, 2024. Funding for this grant is budgeted and available within the 2025 Department of Neighborhoods general operating budget.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is necessary to avoid causing further delays in the execution of the intervention.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a retroactive grant agreement with The Ohio State University for the amount of $26,929.00 to implement a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention for justice-involved Black girls and their caregivers; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $26,929.00 from the General Fund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order, starting March 1, 2024; and to declare an emergency. ($26,929.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Commission on Black Girls studied and assessed the quality of life for Black girls ages 11-22 residing in central Ohio, culminating in actionable recommendations to ensure their successful futures and high quality of life; and\nWHEREAS, The Ohio State University has developed an intervention creating opportunities for healing through a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention specifically designed for justice-involved Black girls ages 14-17 and their caregivers; and\nWHEREAS, this intervention addresses critical issues of PTSD and related behavioral challenges faced by the participants, offering therapeutic interventions that may reduce the likelihood of recidivism and improve physical and mental well-being; and\nWHEREAS, a new ordinance is necessary to ensure the timely execution of the grant agreement, as the planning process has taken longer than anticipated; and\nWHEREAS, emergency action is necessary to avoid further interruptions in the execution of the intervention, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University in the amount of $26,929.00 to support the mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention as detailed above, with authorization for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order, starting March 1, 2024.\nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $26,929.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from the General Fund, to support the purpose set forth in SECTION 1.\nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make accounting changes to revise the funding source for the grant agreement authorized by this ordinance.\nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which are hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
