    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $3,396,978.00 in grant monies to fund the CDC Health Disparities grant program, for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2023.  The total amount funded for this period is $3,396,978.00.\nThe purpose of Columbus Public Health’s Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities will be to increase capacity and services to prevent and control COVID-19 infection and transmission among populations at higher risk.  Our outcomes will be 1) Reduce COVID-19-related health disparities; 2) Improve and increase testing and contact tracing among populations at higher risk; and 3) Improve Columbus Public Health’s capacity and services to prevent and control COVID-19 infection or transmission.  Columbus Public Health will use an evidence-based, holistic, and collaborative approach to address COVID-19-related health disparities.  This funding will support the implementation of the following strategies: 1) Expand existing and develop new mitigation and prevention resources and services to reduce COVID-19 related disparities among populations at higher risk by testing, contact tracing, vaccine coordination, and preventive care through collaborations with traditional and non-traditional partners; 2) Build, leverage and expand infrastructure to support COVID-19 prevention and control through advice, guidance and recommendations from multi-sector coalitions; updated COVID-19 and Health Equity Plans; and hiring people from the communities at highest risk; 3) Mobilize partners to advance health equity and address social determinants of health as they relate to COVID-19 health disparities by building community capacity to reach high risk populations with effective culturally and linguistically tailored programs and practices.\nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.    Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  CDC Health Disparities Grant Program is entirely funded by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and does not generate revenue or require a City match.
