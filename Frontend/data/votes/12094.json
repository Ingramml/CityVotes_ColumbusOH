    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a grant agreement with Franklin County Historical Society (COSI) to support the continued operation and programmatic delivery of their educational initiatives that engage and support Columbus residents, particularly youth and families, in high-quality STEAM education across multiple platforms-onsite, offsite, and online. \n \nCOSI engages in numerous programs that serve Columbus youth and families. These programs include the COSI Science Festival and Big Science Celebration, Learning Lunchboxes, the Museums for All program, the Color of Science, The Platform, COSI Connects2You and ConnectsEDU, and Science Meets Society.\n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests the authority to enter into a grant agreement with COSI so that they are able to provide these important educational services to Columbus children and families.  This agreement will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Section 329.30. No city employee has either the capacity or experience to engage in this work.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $150,000.00 from the 2025 Mayor’s Office of Education General Fund budget.
