The winning teams from each region will be recognized at the Ohio Statehouse during 2025 Computer Science Education Week (December). Success is measured by the number of students registered along with evaluation and survey feedback from students, instructors, and volunteers.\n \nTech Corps will collaborate with local school districts, businesses, community, and youth-serving organizations to implement the 2025 TECHCORPShack.
