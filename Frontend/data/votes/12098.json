    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with the not-for-profit agency, Alvis, Inc. for operational support to integrate economic mobility accelerators with their economic mobility activities in an amount up to $54,000.00.  To authorize the agreements to be effective January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2026. To authorize the advancement of funds on a predetermined schedule as well as authorizing the appropriation and expenditure of funds within the Income Tax Set Aside fund.\n \nIn today’s post-COVID economy, many Columbus residents are challenged with making ends meet, yet they continue to work hard to increase their income and attain economic stability. Challenges to achieving economic stability include stagnant wages and rising costs (e.g. housing, child care, and food).  These conditional cash transfers to residents participating in economic mobility initiatives will accelerate their economic mobility.\n \nBy increasing financial security, individuals can experience improved health and well-being as stress, anxiety and depression are decreased. Stability in housing and employment enables better outcomes for children in health, education and social connection. Moving toward greater economic stability can shape one’s opportunities and aspirations with promises of a better future.\n \nThe public purpose of this agreement is to establish a partnership with Alvis, Inc., to integrate economic mobility accelerators with their economic mobility activities, to accelerate the economic mobility of individuals experiencing poverty in Columbus.\n \nAccelerators are time-limited payments of unrestricted funds to individuals engaged in an economic mobility initiative that is supported by a non-profit organization. These three agencies will work with The Toney R. Wells Foundation which will make the payments directly to participants in the economic mobility activity. \n \nThese funds are organization-level funding that will be used to strengthen the capacity of each organization to fully support the success of Economic Mobility Accelerators. Funding will be advanced to each agency on a predetermined schedule. Advancement of funds is needed because many of the organizations do not have the funding available to be reimbursed for providing operational support. The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order. Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services within the grant agreement.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding of $54,000.00 is available within the Income Tax Set Aside (ITSA) Subfund 100099.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  CC-006073 Expires 06/09/2025\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with the not-for-profit agency, Alvis, Inc., in an amount up to $54,000.00 to provide funding to integrate economic mobility accelerators (Accelerators) with their economic mobility activities; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure in an amount up to $54,000.00 within the Income Tax Set Aside (ITSA) Subfund; to authorize the agreements to be effective January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2026; and to authorize the advancement of funds on a predetermined schedule.
