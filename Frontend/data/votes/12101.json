    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Jewish Family Services, a non-profit corporation, in an amount up to $500,000.00 for the Columbus Financial Empowerment Center and to authorize the payment of expenses starting January 1, 2025.  \n \nIn 2021, the City of Columbus and Columbus Women’s Commission launched the Financial Empowerment Center, a program that has effectively served over 900 Columbus residents, most of whom are women, on their journey to financial stability. Financial instability is indiscriminate in the individuals it affects; however, women are more likely to experience financial instability and feel it’s effects more deeply. \nFinancial stability is crucial to the ability to afford safe, quality housing, daily necessities, and prepare for unforeseen expenses. All of this is required for women and families to not just survive, but thrive.\n \nThe Financial Empowerment Center offers free on-on-one financial counseling as a public service for all Central Ohio residents. Financial counselors are trained and certified by the Cities for Financial Empower Fund to support clients as they navigate complex financial challenges and reach financial goals. The services provided by the FEC ensure women in Columbus, and all Columbus residents, have the ability to achieve financial stability.\n \nJewish Family Services serves as the Financial Counseling Provider to provide free, professional, one-on-one financial counseling services to Columbus residents as a municipal service. The funding provided will be used to retain three (3) financial counselors and one (1) program manager employed by Jewish Family Services for the provision of financial counseling services. The funding will also support marketing services and supplies to raise public awareness of the availability of these free financial counseling services. \n \nThese services cannot be provided by current City employees at this time.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds are available within the Department of Development’s 2025 General Fund budget. \n \nContract Compliance: the vendor number is 006079 and expires on September 7, 2025.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Jewish Family Services for the Columbus Financial Empowerment Center in an amount up to $500,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00; and to authorize payment of expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order, starting January 1, 2025.
