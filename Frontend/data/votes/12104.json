    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into a contract with Intergraph Corporation (now doing business as Hexagon), to enter into contract for the 9.4 upgrade to the City's Computer Aided Dispatching System (CAD). The system was implemented in June 2011, and it has since been determined that an upgrade will be required in order to maintain system compatibility and optimum performance.  Due to the timing of the upgrade implementation, it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the City to move forward and implement the 9.4 upgrade in order to assure long-term compatibility with Hexagon and protect the City's investment in the CAD system.\n \nCAD is used to assist in processing calls from the public to the Department of Public Safety's dispatch center (both Police and Fire).  The system aids the call-takers and dispatchers by electronically moving pertinent data to the proper field personnel over voice or data communications.  CAD also stores data for record-keeping purposes.  The Director of Public Safety contracted with Intergraph Corporation in March 2010 to replace the City's CAD system.  Intergraph completed the project and went live with the new CAD system in June 2011. \n \nContract Compliance:  Contract Compliance Number # 63-0573222 Vendor#009804 - Expiration 4/4/2026\n \nBid Information:  Intergraph Corporation is the only known company that can provide maintenance, support, & licensing for Fire's Emergency Alerting System; therefore, this contract is being executed in accordance with the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of the CAD System, which is critical to the operations of the Department of Public Safety.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $385,732.37 from the general fund for 9.4 upgrade to the City's Computer Aided Dispatching System (CAD) with Intergraph Corporation in accordance with the sole source procurement provisions of the Columbus City Code.  Funds are available in Support Services' general fund budget for this contract.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into contract with Intergraph Corporation for the 9.4 upgrade to the City's CAD System in accordance with the sole source procurement provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $385,732.37 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($385,732.37)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Support Services, has a need to enter into contract with Intergraph Corporation for the 9.4 upgrade to the City's CAD system in order to continue maintenance and support of the system; and,\n \nWHEREAS, due to the timing of implementation of the intended upgrade, it has been determined that it is in the City's best interest to move forward with the 9.4 upgrade in order to assure long-term system compatibility and performance; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Public Safety has a need to modify a contract with Intergraph Corporation for an upgrade to the CAD system; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Intergraph Corporation is the only known company that can provide this upgrade for the CAD system; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this contract is being entered into under the Sole Source Procurement Provision of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and,\n   \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Support Services, in that it is immediately necessary to enter into contract with Intergraph Corporation to upgrade the CAD system, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:                                                      \n          \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Safety be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with Intergraph Corporation for CAD system 9.4 upgrade.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this agreement is hereby entered into pursuant to the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the purpose stated in Section 1 hereof, the expenditure of $385,732.37, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from Fund 1000 general fund, subfund 100010 in object class 03 Contractual Services and 06 Capital, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
