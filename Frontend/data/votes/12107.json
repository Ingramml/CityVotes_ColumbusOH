    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Department of Public Safety to contribute $329,500.00 to The Columbus Urban League, a non-profit corporation, for the purpose of administering the Strive Toward Empowerment & Potential (STEP) Program. STEP is a resource for youths and their parents. It supports educational enrichment, health and wellness, public speaking, job skill development, conflict resolution, and personal and family development education to promote healthy adolescent, familial, and communal relationships and reduce justice involvement. The Columbus Urban League seeks to create familial and community environments where children can build lives that are full of possibility and that they are happy in and proud of. \n \nIn partnership with the City of Columbus & Franklin County Municipal Courts, The Columbus Urban League (CUL) provides STEP classes and resources to families with children on the cusp of entering the justice system. The families joining the STEP program receive a Family Coach from CUL, who helps identify holistic resources for the parents. This provides equitable skills to foster healthy relationships between the parent and the child to deter all parties from further involvement with the court system.\n \nThe STEP program, spanning eight weeks, serves as a dynamic platform for youth engagement and empowerment. During this period, various activities and initiatives are implemented to foster personal growth, community involvement, and a sense of responsibility among participants.  Key components of the program include: Guest speakers; experiential learning opportunities; community vision boards; community engagement; addressing real world challenges; and safety and positive environment.  Referrals come from the community (most common), Columbus City Schools, local charter schools, and the juvenile court system.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the transfer of funds between object classes within the Department of Public Safety's 2025 General Fund Budget to align budget authority for this expenditure.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the necessary funds can be provided to The Columbus Urban League to allow them to begin the next cohort of this program as soon as possible. \n \nFiscal Impact: $329,500.00 is available within the Department of Public Safety's 2025 General Fund Budget for this purpose. Funds will be transferred between object classes within the General Fund. There is sufficient budget authority available in the Department of Public Safety's 2025 General Fund Budget to fund the transfer. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a grant agreement with The Columbus Urban League in support of the Strive Toward Empowerment & Potential (STEP) Program; to authorize the expenditure of $329,500.00 from the General Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer $329,500.00 between object classes within the General Fund to align budget authority for this expenditure; and to declare an emergency.
