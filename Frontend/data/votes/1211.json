    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with IMPACT Community Action, in an amount up to $75,000.00, for its “Drive to Thrive” program. \n \nIn the 2017 IMPACT Community Needs Assessment, transportation was identified as a key barrier to employment by individuals completing the survey.  Eighty-two percent of survey respondents identified insufficient access to transportation as a barrier, 91 percent identified lack of transportation as a condition of poverty, and 79 percent identified transportation vouchers as a much needed resource. Further, in a study conducted by the University of Harvard, and published April, 2015, commuting time has emerged as the single strongest factor in the odds of escaping poverty. Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist researcher summed up the issue stating that “the longer an average commute in a given county, the worse the chances of low income families there moving up the ladder.” According to a 2012 study Travel and Poverty, a reliable means of transportation offers access to greater opportunities such as access to lower-cost, healthier foods, increased employment opportunities, wider education options, healthcare and friends, which affect the quality of life. Considering these factors and the importance of transportation to securing or maintaining employment; IMPACT Community Action has developed programming to enable program participants to increase their mobility options by saving funds to purchase a vehicle.  \nThe “Drive to Thrive” Individual Development Account (IDA) will assist workforce training participants with saving money for a vehicle purchase and/or down payment. The participant’s dollars are matched at a 4:1 ratio. Participants are asked to save at least $500 and are matched with $2,500 for a total of $3,000 toward the purchase of a vehicle. Participants must save for at least 30 days prior to applying for match funds.  Eligible participants will consist of Franklin County residents age 18 and older who are at below 125% of Federal Poverty guidelines with full-time employment.\nThese services provided by IMPACT Community Action cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure program services can begin without delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the Recovery Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 001447 and expires on 12/16/2021.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with IMPACT Community Action, in an amount up to $75,000.00. for its “Drive to Thrive” program; to authorize an expenditure of $75,000.00 from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency.
