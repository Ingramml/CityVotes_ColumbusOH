($550,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to execute contract modification No. 20 to the Organic Waste Processing Agreement between the City of Columbus (City) and Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC (Kurtz). \n \nFixed Rate Sewerage Sludge Processing Term:\n \nThe contract continues a fixed rate fee of $33.50 per wet ton of sewerage sludge processing for the duration of this contract (10 years + 5 year extension). This contract authorizes the transfer to the organic waste recovery and reuse system of up to 25,000 wet tons of sewerage sludge per year at this rate. This contract provides DOSD with an additional beneficial alternative use option for sewerage sludge.\n \nLog Grinding:\n \nThe contract adds a provision to fund log grinding services utilizing funds originally intended for hauling incinerator ash as part of a beneficial reuse program at the City’s two wastewater treatment plants. Incinerator ash had been historically stored at the treatment plants in lagoons and land filled at considerable expense to DOSD. This program allowed for up to 5,000 tons of wastewater treatment incinerator ash a year to be removed and adapted for beneficial reuse at a rate of $30.97 per ton, which was less than the land filing cost to the City. However, in 2015, the City ceased incineration of sewerage sludge, and thus incinerator ash generation, prior to the end of the contract.\n \nAsh Hauling:\n \nThis modification increases the contracted amount for ash hauling per terms of the City and Kurtz’s negotiation over the remaining one-year of that provision of the contract. The City ceased incorporation of incinerator ash into its compost product ahead of that provision of the contract’s end date, and these funds, in addition to the aforementioned log grinding, are the negotiated alternative.  \n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds:  The amount of additional funds needed for this contract is $550,000.00. The total City cost of the original contract and all modifications is $17,864,453.00. \n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  The need for additional funds was foreseen in the original contract. \n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used:  This contract is for 10 years with a 5-year extension provided in the original contract. \n \n4.                     How cost was determined:  The cost, terms and conditions are in accordance with the original agreement as modified.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nKurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC | D365 Vendor #001253 | Expires 10/25/2026 | Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$550,000.00 was budgeted for this modification. The Compost section budgeted for two other bio-solids contracts that will not be encumbered this year, so there is enough funding available to cover the contract's additional log grinding provision.\n \n$262,326.69 has been spent so far in 2025 as of March 25, 2025\n$1,795,178.73 was spent in 2024 \n$519,317.29 was spent in 2023                     \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an agreement with Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC for the design, construction and operation of the Organic Waste Recovery and Reuse System Project; to authorize the expenditure of $550,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund.
