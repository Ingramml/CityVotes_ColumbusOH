    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with various non-profit entities for the Village programs. The entities are: (1) At Home by High; (2) Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center dba Village in the Ville; (3) Central Community House of Columbus dba Village Central; and (4) Village Connections. The grant agreement for each not-for-profit entity will be for $12,500.00. This funding will be provided up-front to defray the cost of operations for each recipient. Spending may include the purchase of groceries and meal preparation/delivery services to combat food insecurity, for which Council deems this expenditure to be serving a public purpose; funding may also be spent on other types of programming and operating costs.\n \nEach of these programs utilizes a member-driven, self-governing, grassroots model focused on developing a mutually supportive network for successful and healthy aging-in-community. The programs serve neighbors age 50 and over. As the older adult population grows, there is a need for innovative approaches to service delivery. The Village Movement approach to aging is successful not only to ensure that older adults are able to age in their homes, but also in community. This movement fosters interdependence between neighbors that supports aging members, in addition to honoring the contributions of younger members. Older adults participating in these programs experience a more connected way of life, whether they are a recipient of services, a provider, or both. In order to generate a strong sense of community, the programs engage members in creating and coordinating the activities of the Village. Members have the opportunity to coordinate and attend social outings, volunteer for the Village organization or for other Village members, and act as advocates for other older adults.\n \nVillages are well positioned to improve the population health of the communities they serve. In Britain and the United States, roughly one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the United States, half of those older than 85 live alone. Studies in both countries show the prevalence of loneliness among people older than 60 ranging from 10% to 46%. Village members consistently report a positive impact on their well-being and quality of life as a direct result of their participation in their Village.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding for this ordinance ($50,000.00) is available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018.\n \nReason for Emergency: The purpose of this ordinance is to provide up-front funding to these organizations in support of their shared mission. Due to current economic conditions and the growing needs of Columbus' aging seniors, it is necessary to ensure that each entity receives this financial support from Council as soon as practicable.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with the not-for-profit entities At Home by High, Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center dba Village in the Ville, Central Community House of Columbus dba Village Central, and Village Connections in support of their shared mission to enable older adults and people with disabilities to live with dignity and independence; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, as the older adult population grows there is a need for innovative approaches to service delivery; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Villages program utilizes a member-driven, strengths-based model focused on developing a mutually supportive network for successful and healthy aging-in-community; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Villages program fosters interdependence between neighbors that supports aging members, in addition to honoring the contributions of younger members; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in that it is immediately necessary to authorize these agreements to ensure the timely support of aging-in-place communities for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $50,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, to the City Clerk per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the expenditure of $50,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1 of this ordinance, is authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Clerk is hereby directed to expend the funds appropriated in SECTION 2 of this ordinance in advance of programming, which is set to commence on May 1, 2025, to accommodate the budgetary needs of the aging-in-place villages.\n \nSECTION 5. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and that the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
