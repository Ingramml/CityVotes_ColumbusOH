    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Besa Community, Inc., a non-profit corporation, in support in support of its volunteer efforts in the areas of neighborhood revitalization, emergency response and relief, and nonprofit infrastructure and capacity building.  This ordinance authorizes an upfront payment to Besa to support these efforts. Besa does not currently have sufficient funds on-hand to await reimbursement for expenses incurred.\n \nIn 2012, Columbus nonprofit Besa launched a mission to reinvent the volunteer experience, inspire service, and transform civic engagement by bringing the community together in meaningful, impactful ways. Besa is an Albanian term that means “to keep a promise.”  Nonprofits are frequently understaffed and overwhelmed, while community members are eager for tangible ways to support neighbors in need. Besa bridges this gap by facilitating volunteer experiences on behalf of nonprofits and then providing an innovative, easy-to-use platform where people can find these opportunities and engage in a cause meaningful to them. From food pantries to homeless shelters and beyond, Besa’s platform offers as many as 100 volunteer opportunities a month.  Since launching in 2012, Besa has rallied over 81,000 volunteers giving 210,000 hours through 13,600 service projects, which have facilitated over $97 million in community impact.\n \nCouncil is proposing support of $100,000.00 for Besa’s volunteer efforts to address the new and emerging challenges facing Columbus nonprofit organizations and impacting entire communities.  The requested city funding would be leveraged with additional funds to support Besa’s 2025 goal of completing 2,000 nonprofit service projects. All city-funded service projects will take place within city limits and in partnership with nonprofits serving high-poverty neighborhoods. Projects will range from ensuring foodbanks have the capacity they need to fight food insecurity, to helping Franklinton families access baby supplies like diapers and wipes. Every service opportunity will be posted in real-time on Besa’s platform depending on the needs of each nonprofit.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $100,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is requested in order for Besa to sustain needed volunteer capacity to serve the needs of nonprofits and residents continuing into 2025.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Besa Community, Inc., in support of its volunteer efforts in the areas of neighborhood revitalization, emergency response and relief, and nonprofit infrastructure and capacity building; to authorize an appropriation of $90,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency ($100,000.00)  \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there are new and emerging challenges facing Columbus nonprofit organizations and impacting entire communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, nonprofits are frequently understaffed and overwhelmed, while community members are eager for tangible ways to support neighbors in need; and\n \nWHEREAS, in 2012, Columbus nonprofit Besa launched on a mission to reinvent the volunteer experience, inspire service, and transform civic engagement by bringing the community together in meaningful, impactful ways; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing support of $100,000.00 for Besa’s volunteer efforts to address these needs; and \n \nWHEREAS, $100,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is necessary for the Clerk to enter into a contract immediately with Besa to sustain the current operations in effect; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
