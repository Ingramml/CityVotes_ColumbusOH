Due to reasons referenced below, the Fire Division requests procurement via STS which requires a bid waiver. \n \nThe apparatus from Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Inc. have been the Fire Division's standardized equipment for several years, as both the Divisions of Fire and Fleet Management believe these products are the best for their operations given the quality, durability and customizability this manufacturer offers, as well as the cost-effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with each manufacturer during the build process.  The subsequent contract established by Fleet Management with this manufacturer has also simplified the managing of parts/service after purchase.\n \nAtlantic Emergency Solutions, Inc. ~ FID #273187193 / Vendor 034448 / SOS Entity 4595230 ~ The Division of Fire is in need to purchase two (2) Pierce Enforcer Pumpers in the total amount of $2,504,426.00.
