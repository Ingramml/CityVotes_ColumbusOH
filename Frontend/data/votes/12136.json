    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services contract with Hill International, Inc. (hereafter Hill International) for the Professional Construction Management Services (PCM) - 2020 contract, CIP Number 690587-100001, in an amount up to $8,090,400.00.\n \nThis Professional Construction Management (PCM) contract assists the City with managing the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water, capital improvement program consisting of multiple capital improvement projects to ensure completion in accordance with design requirements and City’s needs, while serving as a liaison between the construction contractor, design professional (DP), and City personnel.  These projects maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the Central Ohio area.  Work performed to date includes program support services, design phase construction management services (e.g., construction cost estimating, constructability reviews, and construction scheduling), and construction administration / construction inspection (CA/CI) services.  Future phases of the contact will continue these same services.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1 Contract Timeline and Future Modifications:  The Notice to Proceed (NTP) for the original contract occurred in December 2020.  Construction projects are assigned to this contract based on their advertisement date using a three year assignment period that started in December 2020 and runs to December 2023.  Hill International will continue to provide construction services for the construction projects assigned to the PCM-2020 contract during that assignment window until the completion of those construction projects or until the work on those projects are completed to the satisfaction of the City.  It will be necessary to periodically modify the contract to add funds to pay for this continued work until the last construction project originally assigned to the PCM-2020 contract is completed.\n \n1.2 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $8,090,400.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                              $  2,442,500.00 (Ordinance No. 2380-2020)\nRenewal No. 1:                      $  6,826,100.00 (Ordinance No. 1569-2021)\nRenewal No. 2:                      $  7,371,100.00 (Ordinance No. 1404-2022)\nRenewal No. 3:                      $  9,421,900.00 (Ordinance No. 1000-2023)\nModification No. 1:                      $  9,960,500.00 (Ordinance No. 0845-2024)\nModification No. 2 (Current):                                      $  8,090,400.00                     \nModification No. 3 (future estimate):                           $  3,000,000.00\nContract Total:                     $47,112,500.00\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  This work was awarded through the City’s RFP process.  Another procurement process is not required to continue the work.\n \n1.4. How the cost of the modification was determined:  The City identified the services anticipated to be needed over the next year for each project currently assigned to this contract.  Hill International developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services based upon the current contract rates and allowable expenses.  The City and Hill International negotiated to determine the final price.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis PCM contract supports various projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the Central Ohio area.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nMost projects are located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public and for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for projects that impact the public.  \n \nThe consultant team identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying Department of Public Utilities Environmental Management System (EMS) practices to the construction projects.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHill International’s contract compliance number is CC000990 and expires 11/30/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Hill International is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Hill International plans to utilize City-certified MBE/WBE firms to perform 28.51% of the dollar amount of the work of this contract modification. \nAs part of their proposal, Hill International has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                       City/State                                            ODI Certification Status \nH.R.
