    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the City Attorney to modify and increase the amount of a contract with the law firm Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP, an Ohio limited liability partnership, for legal services relative to issues related to the Department of Public Utilities’ Divisions of Sewerage and Drainage PFAS Action Plan development as set forth in the Scope of Services.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes a third modification of the contract entered into with Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP on January 20, 2023. The term of the Contract is from date of last execution until such time as the need for outside legal counsel concludes or the parties mutually agree to terminate this Contract, contingent on budgeted funds and approval of City Council. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. It is in the City's best interest to waive competitive bidding because Erica Spitzig is a legal expert in the field of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their relation to water.  She speaks at national water conferences on legal considerations of the forthcoming federal regulations of PFAS.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract is $191,000.00.
