    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modifya contract with Trebel LLC, extending the contract for an additional five-year termfor the Sustainable Columbus Community Choice Aggregation project. Trebel LLC assists the City with developing, implementing, and managing the Community Choice Aggregation program.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management conducted a competitive Request for Proposals process in 2020 and Trebel was the selected offeror.\n \nNo additional funds need expended under this modification. The initial contract engaged in 2020 had a three year term, with two subsequent one-year renewal options. At this time, Sustainable Columbus finds it most appropriate to engage this brokerage agreement for a five year contract given the complexities of the Sustainable Columbus Community Choice Aggregation project, the 13-year lifespan of the existing Master Service Agreement, and Trebel’s presence throughout the Master Service Agreement’s terms and conditions. \n \nGiven these considerations and the lack of monetary necessity with this contract, the Department is also requesting to waive the competitive bidding process. \n \nTrebel LLC Contract Compliance No. 27-3437017\n \nFiscal Impact:  No funding is required for this legislation. Trebel LLC will be paid for services through an administrative fee per megawatt, kilowatt hour, or similar usage metric by the energy supplier for the City of Columbus’ aggregation program(s) initial energy supply term.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify a contract with Trebel LLC for the Sustainable Columbus Community Choice Aggregation project; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.
