    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $10,399,650.00 to administer six initiatives to address homelessness in the City of Columbus and to authorize the payment of expenses starting January 1, 2025.  The prior expenses include those customarily funded by this annual operating support given to CSB that fund the programs identified in the Background Section of this legislation.  Funding will be advanced to the agency on a predetermined schedule.\n \nPrior to FY2020, the Director of Development had submitted five different ordinances to enter into five separate contracts, one for each initiative. In 2020, in order to increase efficiencies in payments and reporting, all programs were managed under one single contract. This has proven to be more effective and efficient and will be the model moving forward.\n \nCSB has, and will continue, to administer the following six initiatives to address homelessness in our community: Continuum of Care Application, Crisis Response, Outreach Services, Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) Services, Safety Net Program, and Hotel Cost-Office of Violence Prevention. These programs provide support for men, women and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness in Columbus. The CSB leads a coordinated, community effort to make sure everyone has a place to call home. \n \nThe CSB is the collective impact organization driving strategy, accountability, collaboration, and resources to achieve the best outcomes for people facing homelessness in Columbus and Franklin County. The CSB will provide administration, oversight and monitoring of the City’s investment for each of these six initiatives. The City and the CSB are working together to effectively and efficiently help individuals and families resolve their housing crisis and maintain stability in permanent housing.  Below is more detail for each program.\n \nContinuum of Care (CoC) Consolidated Application \nCSB is the designated Collaborative Applicant on behalf of the City of Columbus and Franklin County and will prepare the 2020 Consolidated Application for the Continuum of Care. The Consolidated Application will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for all Columbus and Franklin County renewal and new permanent supportive housing projects. CSB will work with the Columbus and Franklin County Continuum of Care governing committee to develop local Continuum of Care priorities and review projects to be included in the Columbus and Franklin County submission.\n \nCrisis Response\nCSB and its partners are providing services through the following crisis response initiatives for persons experiencing homelessness: single adult crisis response program; assistance to families experiencing homelessness; assistance to pregnant women experiencing homelessness; and, assistance for non-VA eligible veterans. \n \nCollaborative (Street) Outreach Services \nCSB will provide street and land outreach services through its funded partners to reduce unsheltered homelessness in Columbus. Outreach teams will work collaboratively to provide pro-active engagement, referral to medical and behavioral healthcare, and linkage to emergency shelter and permanent housing. \n \nPermanent Supportive Housing (PSH) Services \nCSB will provide its permanent supportive housing (PSH) partners with funding for various supportive services to PSH residents. These services will consist of necessary on-site social services and/or referrals to physical and mental health agencies for formerly homeless individuals currently living in PSH units. \n \nSafety Net \nCSB will provide funding to its partners to continue the City’s support for the operation of emergency shelters, related emergency shelter services, homelessness prevention and transition services for persons experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.\n \nHotel Cost- Office of Violence Prevention \nCSB will provide temporary housing assistance on behalf of the Office of Violence Prevention.\n \nThese programs provide support for men, women and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness in Columbus. The CSB leads a coordinated, community effort to make sure everyone has a place to call home.\n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any disruption of essential services to our vulnerable unhoused residents.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this contract are allocated as follows: $9,143,084.00 from the Department of Development’s Administrative Division’s 2025 General Fund budget, a $10,000.00 transfer from the Office of Violence Prevention’s 2025 budget, and $1,246,566.00 from the General Fund, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund (100099).  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s vendor number is 004795 and is valid thru 12/10/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Community Shelter Board for the purpose of continuing the City’s support for men, women and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness in Columbus; to authorize the payment of expenses prior to purchase order execution starting January 1, 2025; to authorize the transfer of $10,000.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $1,246,566 in the Income Tax Set-Aside Fund to the Department of Development, Administration Division; to authorize an expenditure in an amount up to $10,399,650.00 from the General Fund and the Income Tax Set-Aside Subfund; to authorize the payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages; to allow funding to be advanced to the agency on a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
