    "title": "To amend existing Section 2505.07.6 of Chapter 2505 of the Columbus City Codes to establish and clarify the authority and responsibility for the maintenance of fire hydrants attached to city water lines but located outside the corporate limits of the City of Columbus.",
    "description": "Explanation:\n \nThis ordinance establishes and clarifies the authority and responsibility for the maintenance of fire hydrants attached to city water lines but lying outside the corporate limits of the City of Columbus. In 2022, Title 25, the Fire Prevention Code, was enacted and amended to ensure alignment with the Ohio Fire Code, establish an appeal process for the review of violations, and establish a fee structure for certain permits, inspections, modifications, and rates. During that process, a portion of Title 25 that set forth the responsibilities for the maintenance of fire hydrants connected to city water lines but located outside of the City of Columbus was inadvertently removed. This ordinance amends Section 2505.07.6 to reinsert a previously existing portion of that Section regarding fire hydrant maintenance.  \n \nFiscal Impact:\n \nThere is no immediate fiscal impact to the City.\n \nTitle:\n \nTo amend existing Section 2505.07.6 of Chapter 2505 of the Columbus City Codes to establish and clarify the authority and responsibility for the maintenance of fire hydrants attached to city water lines but located outside the corporate limits of the City of Columbus. \n \nBody:\n \nWHEREAS, an objective of the Division of Fire is to ensure that fire hydrants are operable, not deficient, and comply with the Ohio Fire Code and Title 25 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, an amendment of Section 2505.07.6 is necessary to clarify the responsibility to maintain fire hydrants attached to city water lines located outside of the corporate limits of the City of Columbus; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend Section 2505.07.6 of the Columbus City Codes; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Section 2505.07.6 of Chapter 2505 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended as follows:  \n \nSEE ATTACHMENT\n \nSECTION 2. That existing section 2505.07.6 of Chapter 2505 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed. \n \nSECTION 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
