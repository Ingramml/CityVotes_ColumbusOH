    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with PMM for their work with the Commission on Black Girls in order to build upon the development and design of the 2021 programs to address the systemic inequities impacting young Black girls during COVID-19.  The PMM Agency shall provide event planning services and marketing to assist with the coordination and execution of the following:  Back-to-School Rally, Virtual Summit which will include live segments, Business Pitch Contest, Black Girls SOAR awards program, and activities related to the CROWN act (CROWN - Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair).  PMM will also provide support for youth employment efforts for the Commission on Black Girls.  \n \nIn today’s unprecedented times, African-Americans continue to be disproportionately impacted across social, economic and educational lines. Black girls have disproportionately been impacted during the crisis of COVID-19 to further increase the systemic inequities of race, gender, mental health and wellness, civic and social injustices along with the areas that affect them such as trauma, chronic depression, anxiety, raising siblings and victims of bullying, detentions/suspension and expulsion as documented in “A Report on the Quality of Life of Black Girls in Columbus, Ohio” published in July 2020.The intent of the events executed by PMM Agency is to uplift, empower, and educate Black girls that have experienced increased mental health challenges during COVID-19. Organizations that have partnered with the Commission on Black girls reported that due to COVID-19 and the remote learning that took place in 2020 and 2021, Black girls are feeling isolated, are having difficulty connecting with their peers, and are experiencing increased “Adultification” as they are expected to take on more household chores and care for younger siblings. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and remote education many students of color have falling behind academically.  The expenditure for PMM will help in engaging a demographic that has been adversely impacted by COVID-19.  The events and activities coordinated by PMM will place an emphasis on education, career pathways, and self-care.  The events will also focus on areas addressed in “A Report on the Quality of Life of Black Girls in Columbus, Ohio” including: academic, mental health and well-being, and economic impact.  These quality of life indicators are important elements to developing resources for Black girls and young women to build stronger neighborhoods and successful futures. Moreover, the messaging created by PMM will be responsive to the experience of Black girls which include systemic inequities of race, gender, mental health and wellness, civic and social injustices, and natural hair discrimination.  \n \nBack-to-School Rally and Summit for Black Girls \nFor the Back-to-school rally, PMM will target a year-over-year increase from 2020 (350 attendees) at a minimum of 20% to reach at least 425 young girls. \n \nThis year’s summit will include a LIVE feed- to enhance the recorded content format used in 2020 -  maximizing its momentum, also with year-over-year increase from 2020 (nearly 500 attendees) at a minimum of 20% to reach at least 600 young girls. \n \nFurther, the summit is a “safe space” convening African-American girls, ages 11 - 22 years, to learn, reflect and empower themselves and others among a community of young Black queens. Designed to provide important life-skills and tangible best practices in the areas of leadership, critical thinking, professional development, financial literacy, self-care, self-love, health and wellness and more, the Summit will feature national, regional and local thought leaders/speakers across a variety of general sessions and specialized workshops.    \n \nThe summit will include: \n•                     Black Girls Marketplace - The summit will include an expo floor featuring businesses and organizations with products and/or services that enhance the lives of Black girls in the areas of college readiness, grooming, mental health, wellness, self-love and professional development. \n•                     Business Pitch Competition - With women of color being the fastest growing segment of entrepreneurs this is an effort to proactively equip Black girls to succeed in business. As part of the Black Girls Soar summit there will be a business pitch competition, offering mentorship and financial resources to winners. \n•                     Black Girls SOAR Award - Black Girls SOAR is a crowning salute to the exemplary young women in Central Ohio who've got NOW and NEXT and are using their talents and voices to positively affect change. Black Girls SOAR will highlight the achievement and excellence of Black girls in the areas to be considered across academics, athletics, creativity, performing/visual arts, entrepreneurship, perseverance, social justice, service and volunteerism, along with STEM & innovation.  \n \nCreate a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair - CROWN Act \nThis year, PMM also will add an in-market campaign toolkit for the Crown Act. This will include content, consultancy to Columbus City Council call-to-action host site/resource platform. Important to activities with the Crown Act will be working with Black girls to promote the messaging around the acceptance and beauty of natural hair.  \n \nSupport for Youth Employment \nFinally, PMM will work with The Center for Healthy Families to guide the work of girls ages 16-24 years old.  The girls will gain job skills in various areas while helping with the planning and implementation of the Back-to-school rally, Summit, and Crown Act activities. \n \nA bid waiver is requested in order to provide for the most efficient deployment of services recommended by the Commission on Black Girls. PMM Agency is a woman and minority owned marketing firm.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available to support this contract within the general fund.\n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delay in providing the resources necessary to respond to the increased demand as a function of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with PMM in support of their work with the Commission on Black Girls to provide COVID-19 outreach efforts to Black girls; to authorize a transfer of appropriations within the general fund; to authorize an expenditure within the general fund; to authorize a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
