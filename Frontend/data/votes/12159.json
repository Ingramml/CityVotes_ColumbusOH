    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize Period Poverty Awareness Week in Columbus\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, period supplies are a necessary product, each month, for millions of people across the country; and\n \nWHEREAS, national surveys and research studies report that two in five women and girls struggle to secure enough period supplies to meet their needs each month due to a lack of income; and\n \nWHEREAS, this lack of period supplies, known as period poverty, can adversely affect the health and well-being of menstruators - exacerbating the vicious cycle of poverty by forcing menstruators to withdraw from daily life, losing pay or missing educational opportunities; and\n \nWHEREAS, menstruators struggling with period poverty risk infections by using proxy products - such as socks or toilet paper - or not changing products as often as needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, the people of Columbus recognize that period poverty is a public health issue, and addressing period poverty can lead to economic opportunity for the state’s people and communities and improved health for women and girls/menstruators, thus ensuring all people have access to the basic necessities required to thrive and reach their full potential; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus is proud to be home to trusted community-based organizations, including The Period Pantry Project, that recognize the importance of period products in ensuring health and providing economic stability and thus distribute period products through various channels; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize the numerous contributions made by the volunteers, advocates, donors, and staff working to secure a safe and healthy community for individuals across the Columbus; and does hereby declare the week of May 12th through May 18th, 2025, as Period Poverty Awareness Week in Columbus.",
