    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Aluminum Sheeting and Sign Blanks with MD Solutions, LLC. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to purchase Aluminum Sheeting and Sign Blanks with MD Solutions.  The Division of Traffic Management is the sole user for Aluminum Sheeting and Sign Blanks. Aluminum sheeting and Sign Blanks are used to fabricate various sizes of street signs used throughout the City. There can’t be a lapse in contract which would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Division of Traffic Management.  An RFP process is needed to establish a new contract.  There is not enough time to use a procurement process to award a new contract.  Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n \nThe contract, PO277505 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ018529 and authorized for extension under Ordinance Number 1460-2021 and will expire June 30, 2025.  The City and MD Solutions have agreed to modify and extend the contract for one additional year term subject to approval of proper City Authorities. The new contract expiration date will be June 30, 2026.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contract.  The Division of Traffic Management must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Aluminum Sheeting and Sign Blanks with MD Solutions, LLC. ($0.00) \n \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Aluminum Sheeting and Sign Blanks for use by Division of Traffic Management; and  \n \nWHEREAS, this contract was entered into in accordance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code, pursuant to solicitation RFQ018529 with MD Solutions deemed the lowest, most responsive, responsible, and best bidder; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Traffic Management to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract with MD Solutions for the option to purchase Aluminum Sheeting and Sign Blanks; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contract with MD Solutions, PO277505 for a period of one (1) year, from July 1, 2025 to and including June 30, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
