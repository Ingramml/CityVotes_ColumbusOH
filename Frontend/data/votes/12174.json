    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nOn December 12, 2022, the Columbus City Treasurer's Office, in collaboration with the Department of Finance and Management and the City Auditor’s Office, issued a request for proposal, RFQ023687, for various banking services.  An Evaluation Committee comprised of five representatives from the City Treasurer’s Office, Department of Public Utilities, Department of Finance and Management, Division of Income Tax, and the City Auditor’s Office received and reviewed proposals from six (6) banks.  On May 12, 2023, a joint meeting of the Columbus Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board was held at which the Treasurer presented the Evaluation Committee’s rankings of offerors.  The Treasurer recommended, and the Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board approved, subject to successful negotiation and the approval of City Council, the award of banking services to specific banks.\n \nAll such banks are currently eligible depositories of the City of Columbus, pursuant to Section 321.04 of the Columbus City Codes.  The contracts are for a period of ten (10) years, beginning September 1, 2023, through August 31, 2033, subject to annual appropriations and approval of contracts by the Columbus City Council.\n \nThe initial contract term of 17 months aligned the annual term to roughly coincide with the City’s budget cycle.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended:         $680,000.00\nCost summary: \nOriginal Contract, Ordinance #1689-2023                                           $     10,000.00\nModification #1, Ordinance #0518-2024                                                       $1,156,000.00\nModification #2, Ordinance #2880-2024                                                       $   466,000.00\nModification/Renewal #3, Ordinance #0218-2025                      $1,496,000.00\nModification #4, Ordinance #0531-2025                                                               $1,105,000.00\nModification #5, (This Ordinance)                                                                      $   680,000.00 \nEstimated Contract Total:                                                                             $4,913,000.00\n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nWhile the original contract with JP Morgan Chase anticipated that City agencies would transition to the vendor’s banking services over time, the specific timing and volume of agency onboarding could not be fully determined at the time the contract was awarded. The contract was structured with the expectation that usage would grow as more agencies began utilizing services such as merchant processing and lockbox operations. As these services became more integrated into agency operations, the volume of transactions increased, thereby necessitating additional funding. The need for this modification is a result of increased volume of services, which was anticipated generally but could not be forecasted precisely.\n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe original bid process for RFQ023687 resulted in the award of a ten-year contract to JP Morgan Chase, subject to annual appropriations and Council approval. JP Morgan Chase was selected to provide the full suite of banking services required by the City, including merchant processing and lockbox operations. It would not be in the City’s best interest to pursue alternative procurement methods for these services, as the pricing and service framework was competitively established during the initial bid process. Modifying the existing contract ensures continuity, efficiency, and consistency in service delivery.\n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe pricing for services under this contract was established during the original bid process and has remained consistent. Increases in funding are based on actual and projected usage by individual City agencies. Each agency determined its funding request according to its service volumes, which continue to grow as the banking services become more integrated with their daily operations. The total amount of this modification, $680,000.00, reflects these agency assessments and corresponds to the pricing structure agreed upon in the initial contract. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:\nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure that the City agencies have sufficient funds to pay for the banking services they are receiving.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds for these expenditures are budgeted and available within the various funds’ 2025 budget appropriations.\n \nContract Compliance:  JP Morgan Chase Bank, 134994650, expiration 5/11/2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to modify its contract for banking services with JP Morgan Chase Bank; to authorize the expenditure of $680,000.00 from various funds within the City; and to declare an emergency.
