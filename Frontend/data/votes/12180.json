    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service, or a designee, to enter into a construction contract or similar instrument, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, with CSX Transportation Inc. (“CSX”) and Norfolk Southern Railway Company (“Norfolk Southern”), respectively, and to encumber and expend funds to compensate the same for services rendered during the construction phase of the Bridge Rehab - UIRF - Milo Grogan Second Avenue Improvements project.\nThe aforementioned effort will encompass various improvements to the stretch of 2nd Avenue from St. Clair Avenue to 6th Street, including the installation of new sidewalks, curb ramps, curb, curb extensions, street trees, permeable paver parking, and new street lighting with underground conduits. \nBoth CSX and Norfolk Southern operate within the project limits, necessitating the execution of construction agreements between the Department of Public Service and those entities to facilitate the performance of certain services to identify and mitigate potential conflicts between rail operations and public infrastructure in proximity to railway corridors. These services include plan review, flagging, and inspection, which are necessary to the successful completion of the project, and must be performed by the railroad owner/operator in order to comply with current regulations. To that end, this legislation seeks to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with CSX and Norfolk Southern and to compensate the same for said services.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $225,000 is available for this project in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within the Department of Public Service.
