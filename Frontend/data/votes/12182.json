    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio (NAICCO), a non-profit organization, to defray the cost of a van that will allow the organization to provide transportation services to program participants. The mission of the organization is to preserve and restore balance in the lives of Native Americans through traditional, cultural, educational, family, community, and wellness driven values and initiatives. Their focus areas are (1) Cultural Preservation/Restoration, (2) Social Development, and (3) Economic Development/Sustainability.\n \nThe NAICCO Outdoors initiative is an ongoing extension of NAICCO’s two previously implemented projects - both the Investing in Indianness to Ensure Our Future project and the Honoring Our Heritage to Ensure Our Future project were consecutively funded by Columbus City Council (December 2022 - January 2025). Notably, through participation in these projects, Native Americans from the NAICCO community have been able to develop a deeper connection to their Native American identity (individual, family, and community levels), attain invaluable cultural knowledge, develop important life skills, and grow more in their everyday lives (mind, body, and spirit). To date, NAICCO has been able to implement numerous programs in the focus area of what is better known as NAICCO Outdoors. Sustaining the success of this initiative is imperative to the lives of many Native Americans. As such, NAICCO must be able to continue engaging the local Native American community by meeting them where they are in their lives. To further strengthen the good work and the foundation that’s been created thus far - in and through NAICCO Outdoors programming - NAICCO needs to address the transportation issue it is currently facing.\n \nNAICCO’s 2017 Chevy Express community van - which was used regularly during the two aforementioned projects funded by Columbus City Council - has begun to reveal its eight years and 140,000+ miles of use. Over the past two years, the van has been in need of mechanical attention multiple times. As the van continues to take on more wear and tear, it can only be expected that additional mechanical issues will arise. This is of concern because the van is meant to serve as a reliable means of transportation for a number of NAICCO community members - those who would not be able to attend NAICCO Outdoors programs due to transportation challenges in their lives. As such, NAICCO is seeking $25,000 in funding from Columbus City Council to secure a new or lightly used sprinter passenger van to reliably transport NAICCO community members to and from NAICCO Outdoors programs (along with other NAICCO community events and activities) for many more years to come. The targeted constituency for NAICCO Outdoors programming will continue to be the individuals and families from the intertribal community at NAICCO. Upon purchasing the new or lightly used sprinter passenger van, NAICCO will document all program activities that utilize the vehicle over a one-year period. All program attendance will be tracked as well during that time period.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio; and to authorize an expenditure from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($25,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio is a nonprofit organization that serves to preserve and restore balance in the lives of Native Americans through traditional, cultural, educational, family, community, and wellness driven values and initiatives; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio focuses on (1) Cultural Preservation/Restoration, (2) Social Development, and (3) Economic Development/Sustainability; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio requires a new van in order to provide transportation for individuals experiencing difficulty in finding their own way to attend the organization's programming; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio to defray the cost of a van.\n \nSECTION 2.
