    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with S.G. Loewendick & Sons, Inc. for the Facility Demolition Program 2024. The modification amount is $40,000.00, with a contingency of $7,500.00, for a total of $47,500.00. An additional $2,500.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $50,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n   \nEach year, the Columbus Recreation and Park Department enters into contract to demolish dilapidated, unsafe, and unused structures. This year's project initially included the demolition of abandoned buildings, parking lots, and miscellaneous debris from recently acquired properties at 1247 West Broad Street, 2661 Sunbury Road, and the Sawmill Road Nature Preserve. This modification will include the demolition of the old batting cages located in Berliner Sports Park. The original project completion date of the project was April 30, 2025. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will be June 30, 2025.  \n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $50,000.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: The batting cages have not been operational for several years but funding for demolition was not available. Funding is now available for this demolition.  It is necessary to remove this structure as soon as possible to alleviate safety concerns and to allow for storm water credits that will be used to facilitate the construction of a planned parking lot.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: S.G. Loewendick & Sons, Inc. is mobilized, has capacity to remove the batting cages prior to the busy summer tournament season, and has the ability to remove the safety concerns most expeditiously.  \n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has significant data of demolition costs from S.G. Loewendick & Sons, Inc. as they have been a successful bidder on demolition projects for the past several years. The quote provided to perform this work falls in line with past contract work and unit price work already part of this existing contract.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nS.G. Loewendick & Sons, Inc.\n2877 Jackson Pike\nGrove City, Ohio 43123  \nJoey Loewendick, (614) 539-2582\nContract Compliance Number: 006131\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 27, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested because the Berliner batting cages have fallen into disrepair and need to be removed for the safety of the public visiting the park.\nBenefits to the Public: This project seeks to remove unsafe and underutilized structures to improve safety for the public. It also creates space for the construction of new facilities, bringing opportunities for new programming.\nCommunity Input/Issues: Columbus Recreation and Parks Department staff determined which structures to demolish in this project.\nArea(s) Affected: Southwest (59)\nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by ensuring parks and facilities remain accessible, safe and user friendly.  \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $209,700.00 was legislated for the Facility Demolition 2024 Project contract by Ordinance 3444-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $50,000.00. $50,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $259,700.00.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with S.G.
