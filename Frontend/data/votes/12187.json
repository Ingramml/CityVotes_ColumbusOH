    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Greater Community Foundation in support of the Soulful Steps program. Soulful Steps is a line dancing program offered twice monthly and are led by experienced instructors who specialize in creating a welcoming and energetic atmosphere. The sessions will:\n                     1. Increase physical activity levels, which helps reduce the risk of obesity and chronic diseases.\n                     2. Create an enjoyable and accessible way for participants to stay active.\n                     3. Build a sense of community and social support, enhancing mental well-being.\n                     4. Provide education on the importance of physical activity in maintaining overall health.\n \nThe goals of the program include:\n                     1. Promote Physical Activity: Encourage at least 50 participants to engage in regular, heart-healthy exercise through line dancing by the end of the first year.\n                     2. Foster Health Education: Provide participants with resources and information on the benefits of exercise and healthy living from a local nutritionist who will teach how to shop healthy and prepare healthy meals.\n                     3. Expand Program Accessibility: Evaluate the program’s success and explore the feasibility of expanding to a weekly schedule after the first year.\n                     4. Provide Access to Healthy Food: Provide monthly transportation to full-service grocery stores.\n \nSoulful Steps began planning, marketing, and recruitment efforts in January and February of this year. The program officially launched in March and the first session took place. And from April through December, dance classes occur every two weeks. Finally, in December, the program will be evaluated for potential expansion.\n \nThe funding provided by this ordinance is intended to be issued to the organizers on a reimbursement basis because programming has already begun for 2025, as indicated by the aforementioned timeline.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018.\n \nREASON FOR EMERGENCY: Programming for Soulful Steps has already commenced for this year and the organizers require support in order to ensure the timely execution of dance lessons, as well as other services provided through the program like transportation to the grocery store.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Greater Community Foundation; to authorize an expenditure in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($10,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Soulful Steps Program offers line dancing classes on a bimonthly basis to facilitate physical exercise and build a sense of community; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Program provides participants resources and information on the benefits of exercise and healthy living from a local nutritionist who will teach how to shop healthy and prepare healthy meals; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Program will provide monthly transportation to full-service grocery stores; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Greater Community Foundation as the Soulful Steps program has already begun scheduled programming, and funds are needed to support the essential operations of the program including access to grocery stores and health and wellness resources, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Greater Community Foundation in support of the Soulful Steps Program.\n \nSECTION 2.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
