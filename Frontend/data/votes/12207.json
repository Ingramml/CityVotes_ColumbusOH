    "title": "To amend Ordinance Number 2989-2024 for the sole purpose of adding the fees for the Foreclosure, Vacant and Wholesaler registries to the Combined Development Related Fee Schedule as shown on the attachment; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nOrdinance No. 2989-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on December 9, 2024, adopted a new Combined Development Related Fee Schedule (“Fee Schedule”) as required by City Code Section 4103.14.  This legislation authorizes an amendment to that ordinance for the sole purpose of adding the fees for the Foreclosure, Vacant and Wholesaler registries to the Fee Schedule as shown on the attachment to this ordinance.  \nLast year, City Council passed several housing initiatives including Foreclosed Property Registry and Vacant Property Registry.  The purpose of these registries is to ensure that foreclosed properties and vacant properties are protected and maintained and that city officials are alerted to the location of these vulnerable properties. In addition, anyone acting as a Residential Property Wholesaler is now required to register with the City. The Department of Building and Zoning Services is required to maintain these registries and must, therefore, include the fees for registration in its Fee Schedule.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested so that the fees will be established as soon as possible so registrants will be aware of the amount they have to pay when the Department’s registration software becomes active on or about June 1, 2025.\nFISCAL IMPACT: None.\n \n \nTitle\n \n \nTo amend Ordinance Number 2989-2024 for the sole purpose of adding the fees for the Foreclosure, Vacant and Wholesaler registries to the Combined Development Related Fee Schedule as shown on the attachment; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)                                          \n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council passed several housing initiatives including Foreclosed Property Registry and Vacant Property Registry to ensure that foreclosed properties and vacant properties are protected and maintained and that city officials are alerted to the location of these vulnerable properties; and\nWHEREAS, anyone acting as a Residential Property Wholesaler is now required to register with the City; and\nWHEREAS, the Department of Building and Zoning Services is required to maintain these registries and must, therefore, include the fees for registration in its Fee Schedule, per City Code Section 4103.14; and\nWHEREAS,  it is necessary to amend Ordinance No. 2989-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on December 9, 2024, for the sole purpose of adding the fees for the Foreclosure, Vacant and Wholesaler registries to the Combined Development Related Fee Schedule as shown on the attachment; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to amend the Fee Schedule so that the registry fees can be added and become effective as of June 1, 2025; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That Ordinance Number 2989-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on December 9, 2024, is hereby amended for the sole purpose of adding the fees for the Foreclosure, Vacant and Wholesaler registries to the Combined Development Related Fee Schedule, as shown on the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
