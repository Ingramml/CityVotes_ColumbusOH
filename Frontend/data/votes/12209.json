    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to enter into a planned modification to extend a contract with Fast LP for Gentax software and professional services related to the Income Tax Revenue System. This modification authorizes and funds the second renewal of the seven (7) year pricing schedule included in the initial RFP and resulting contract, and includes funding to continue enhanced Simple Message Service (SMS) messaging and identify verification services offered by FAST LP. \n \nThe current contract for these services, authorized by Ordinance 1156-2024 and passed by Council on June 10, 2024, added additional funding, extended the term of the contract for an additional year, and modified the contract to include Simple Message Service (SMS) option in order to provide enhanced services and communication to the city’s constituents.  \n \nOrdinance No. 0867-2021, passed by the Columbus City Council on April 19, 2021, authorized the City Auditor to enter into contract with Fast LP for the purchase and implementation of GENTAX software and professional services for the collection and recording of tax revenue. The initial contract term covered three (3) years and contained the option to renew annually after the initial term of three (3) years expired, subject to annual appropriation and approval by City Council.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the second modification of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provision of Chapter 329 of the City Code.\n1.  Amount of additional funds: $2,762,753.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $32,024,753.00.\n2.  Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  The need for additional funds was known at the time of the initial contract and this legislation authorizes funding to cover a continuation of maintenance and support services, including enhanced messaging and identity verification services.\n3.  Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter:  The original contract was awarded after an extensive Request for Proposal process was conducted, and FAST LP was selected as the highest rated offeror. Included in the evaluation was a total cost of ownership for a period of three (3) years of implementation and four (4) years afterward. The implementation of the product and transition to another would take a minimum of two (2) years and it is highly unlikely that the city would be able to procure and implement a lower rated solution for less than seven (7) times the cost of this renewal based on the previous RFP responses and total cost of ownership calculations. The SMS option and enhanced identity verification services are additional features designed to augment the implemented functionality and improve service and security for taxpayers.\n4.  How cost was determined:  The cost is based on the Milestone Payment Schedule for year four (4) established in the existing contract.  \nContract Compliance:  The vendor contract compliance number is 031630 and is valid through May 29, 2026.  \nFiscal Impact:\nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $2,762,753.00 from the General Operating Budget.  Funds were specifically budgeted for this contract. \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to modify and extend the agreement with Fast LP for one (1) year to maintain and support the GenTax revenue management system for the Division of Income Tax, including additional messaging and identity verification services; and to authorize the expenditure of $2,762,753.00 from the General Fund. ($2,762,753.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 0867-2021, passed by the Columbus City Council on April 19, 2021, authorized the Department of the City Auditor, Division of Income Tax, to enter into a contract with Fast LP for the implementation and support of GenTax; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract was for three (3) years from May 4, 2021, through June 17, 2024, with pricing and terms for four (4) additional one-year terms based upon mutual agreement of the parties, budgeted funds, and approval by City Council; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance seeks authority to modify the contract to add additional funding and for the second of four (4) annual renewal provisions provided for within the original contract; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Auditor be and hereby is authorized to modify a contract with Fast LP for Gentax software and professional services for the Division of Income Tax to increase funding in an amount up to $2,762,753.00 to continue services without interruption, including additional messaging and identity verification services, and to extend the contract end date to May 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $2,762,753.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 2202 (Division of Income Tax), object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
