    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND\n \nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is hosting a Pedestrian & Bicycle Special Solicitation (until May 1, 2025) for projects that make walking and biking a safe, convenient, and accessible transportation option for all Ohioans. A variety of pedestrian and bicycle related projects are eligible for this special solicitation, including:\n•                     Plans and Studies - the development of pedestrian and/or bicycle related plans or studies at the state, regional, local, or corridor level.\n•                     Data Collection - the collection of data related to walking and biking.\n•                     Education and Promotion - activities that educate on bicycle and walking matters and those which promote walking, biking, and transit as a transportation option.\n•                     Short Term Infrastructure Projects - engineering, design, and/or construction of pedestrian and bicycle projects that can begin construction by June 30, 2026.\n•                     Traditional Infrastructure Projects - engineering, design, and/or construction of standalone pedestrian and bicycle projects of statewide significance.\n \nMay 1, 2025 is the final deadline for the current Pedestrian & Bicycle Special Solicitation application cycle.  Non-infrastructure projects do not require a local match.\n \nThe Department of Public Service plans to submit an application for ODOT’s consideration, with a focus on data collection and demonstration projects.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECT\nThe Department of Public Service plans to submit an application to develop a Quick Build Toolkit designed to accelerate the planning and implementation of pedestrian and bicycle safety improvements. Quick Build projects use temporary materials that are reversible and adjustable which can be installed quickly.  This Toolkit will support the implementation of two bike lane projects and two Vision Zero projects each year. The type of Quick Build is a Pilot project which will be implemented for a minimum of one month and a maximum of one year.  The Toolkit includes materials such as temporary paint and pavement markings, traffic control materials like water barriers, cones, and temporary curbs, as well as MUTCD signs. Additionally, the Toolkit includes bike and pedestrian counters to measure the project’s effectiveness through pre- and post-project data collection.\n \n(This listing is meant to be illustrative and is believed to be accurate and complete; however, last minute project additions and substitutions are at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.)\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  A local match is not anticipated based on the funding opportunity for this type of project. If required, City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts, right of way acquisition, and/or construction contracts that will be submitted for Council's approval.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to prepare and submit a Pedestrian and Bicycle Special Solicitation Application to the Ohio Department of Transportation; to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements relative to application award; to accept and expend grant funds; and issue refunds if necessary, after final accounting is performed.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation is accepting applications for Pedestrian & Bicycle Special Solicitation program funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service plans to submit an application for ODOT’s consideration, with a focus on data collection and demonstration projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to submit an application, execute grant agreements, accept and expend grant funds, and issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting for approved projects; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, is hereby authorized to prepare, execute, and submit an application for Pedestrian & Bicycle Special Solicitation funds to the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation.\n \nSECTION 2.  That Council understands and agrees the Quick Build Toolkit project is intended to be submitted on the special solicitation application, but authorizes the Director of Public Service to change the project submitted and/or to include additional projects on the application at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to execute agreements and documents necessary to accept Pedestrian & Bicycle Special Solicitation funds and/or other ODOT funds if awarded.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to accept and expend the funds for the approved projects.\n \nSECTION 5.  That, at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 6.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
