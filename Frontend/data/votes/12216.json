    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND AND BID INFORMATION:\nThis legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to issue purchase orders to The Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of Fire and EMS emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment.\nCompetitive bidding is being waived for this purchase.  City agencies are required to obtain at least three actual quotes from State Term Schedules (STS). Due to reasons referenced below, the Fire Division requests procurement via STS which requires a bid waiver. \n \nThe apparatus from The Sutphen Corporation have been the Fire Division's standardized equipment for several years, as both the Divisions of Fire and Fleet Management believe these products are the best for their operations given the quality, durability and customizability each manufacturer offers, as well as the cost-effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with each manufacturer during the build process.  The subsequent contracts established by Fleet Management with each manufacturer have also simplified the managing of parts/service after purchase.\n \nThe Sutphen Corporation ~ FID #310671786 / Vendor 004200 / SOS Entity 309414 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase one (1) Sutphen Heavy Duty 100’ Mid-Mount Aerial Ladder in the amount of $2,515,613.00 along with all the pertinent equipment necessary to operate the vehicle. This purchase is made in accordance with State of Ohio Index #STS618, Schedule #STS023111, which expires 8/31/2027.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Current build times (14 months for the ladder) for the fire apparatus purchased in this ordinance require emergency action to ensure funds are encumbered immediately to allow for the production of these custom apparatus to commence upon passage of this ordinance and confirmation of the subsequent purchase orders.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  Cash is available upon transfer from various projects within the Safety Voted Bond Fund for this purchase. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is also required \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $2,515,613.00 within various projects of the Safety Voted Bond Fund; to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into contracts with and issue purchase orders to The Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of one (1) Sutphen Heavy Duty 100’ Mid-Mount Aerial Ladder and related equipment; to authorize the expenditure of $2,515,613.00 from the Safety Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
