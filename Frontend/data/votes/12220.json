    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation in an amount up to $1,173,587.48 the transfer between object classes within fund 2201 and various HOME Grants in an amount up to $126,639.13 and expenditure in an amount up to $1,500,000.00 of grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), through the HOME Investment Partnerships Program grant (HOME) and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program American Rescue Plan (HOME-ARP) and authorizes the Director of Development to execute separate commitment letters, loan agreements, promissory notes, mortgages, and restrictive covenants with Nelson Park Preservation Association LLC for the Nelson Park Apartments project based on their funding sources.\n \nTotal City funding for the project utilizing grant funding is $1,875,000.00.  Of this amount $1,500,000.00 is found within this ordinance and establishes HOME and HOME -ARP funding for the Nelson Park Apartments project. A subsequent ordinance will be put forth to City Council in an amount up to $375,000.00 for the remaining HOME-ARP funding of this project to provide supportive services for residents at this location over the course of four years. There will be an additional ordinance for the bond eligible portion of this project in an amount up to $4,800,000.00.\n \nNelson Park Apartments involves the acquisition and rehabilitation of an existing 177-unit affordable housing development in the Eastgate neighborhood on the near east side of the City of Columbus.  The property was originally constructed in 1958 and has been identified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office and the National Park Service (NPS) as a historically significant asset as it was one of the first housing developments in the United States that was developed using financial assistance from the Section 221 program and has been listed on the National Historic Register.  The property has not received a substantial rehabilitation since 1980 when it was brought into HUD’s Section 8 sub-rehab program.  The project currently includes 47 residential buildings with one, two, and three-bedroom townhomes serving both families and seniors which are covered 100% by a HUD Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment contract.  Preservation of this community is critically important as rents and home values continue to increase all the while affordability continues to decline.  \n \nThe current owner of Nelson Park Apartments, The Orlean Company, along with its development partners Renewal Housing Associates, and the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority have prepared a comprehensive, multifaceted redevelopment plan not only to ensure the long-term viability and affordability of Nelson Park Apartments, but also to ensure that the housing provided on this site better serves the residents and the surrounding community.  \n \nDue to existing restrictions on the property Nelson Park has limited financial resources to address the current issues in a meaningful and lasting way making the redevelopment plan necessary and urgent.  This location has faced challenges due to its size, building obsolescence, and residential mix that it has been a challenge to manage, operate, and maintain effectively.  This does not also speak to the numerous instances of violence and crime at this location.  Therefore, as part of the redevelopment plan the overall footprint and population of the property will be reduced from 47 residential buildings to 42 residential buildings and the units will decrease from 177 to 140 units.  Post-rehab there will be 14 elderly buildings with four (4) 1-BR units in each and 28 family buildings with two (2) 2-BR units and one (1) 3-BR units in each.  \n \nThe condensing of the property will allow the property to be more easily managed, maintained, and allow the residents to access a new community building, management office, and other amenities that will be provided.  New lighting and enhanced security systems, along with a reduction in the number of curb cuts and ingress/egress points on the property will further improve the safety and security of the residents and surrounding area.  This property currently serves many extremely low-income households that include families and seniors but as part of the redevelopment plan the property will also serve homeless and formerly homeless individuals referred by the Community Shelter Board (CSB).  This property will provide services to residents that seek to improve their health and wellness, education, and workforce outcomes.  The property will continue to benefit from a Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) bus stop as well as Nelson Park which is a City of Columbus Recreation and Parks Department facility.  All existing residents at the property will remain at the property and during the rehab, temporary relocation services will occur and be provided for to minimize the disruption of the lives of the residents.  \n \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME-ARP Allocation Plan portion of the City’s 2021 HUD Annual Action Plan which was amended, per Ordinance 0459-2023 as well as the 2019 Annual Action Plan per ordinance 2776-2018, the 2020 Annual Action Plan per ordinance 2162-2019, the 2021 Annual Action Plan per ordinance 2345-2020, and the 2022 Annual Action plan per ordinance 2800-2021.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 051189 and expires on 12/09/2026\n \nEmergency Designation:  An emergency exists as there are time restrictions and deadlines for this project that are set forth by HUD and therefore require this ordinance to be that of an emergency nature.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,500,000.00 is available from and within the HOME and the HOME-ARP grants.  \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation in an amount up to $1,173,587.48, the transfer between object classes in an amount up to $126,639.13, and the expenditure of funds in an amount up to $1,500,000.00 of the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 HOME Investment Partnerships Program, and the HOME Investment Partnerships ARP Program (HOME-ARP) funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into separate commitment letters, loan agreements, promissory notes, mortgages, and restrictive covenants with Nelson Park Preservation Association LLC, in an amount up to $1,500,000.00 for the Nelson Park Apartments project based on their funding sources;
