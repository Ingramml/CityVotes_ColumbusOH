    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThe Sutphen Corporation is engaged in a bitter labor dispute with Teamsters Local 284.  This dispute has raised a question with Columbus City Council as to whether the Sutphen Corporation can deliver a vitally needed Heavy Duty 100’ Mid-Mount Aerial Ladder for the Columbus Division of Fire without delay. This delay issue was highlighted at the May 12, 2025 meeting of Columbus City Council by the conflicting testimony of Josh Plichta of the Sutphen Corporation and Mark Vandak, President of Teamsters Local 284. President Vandak stated that the Sutphen Corporation “cannot promise the City of Columbus uninterrupted production or the on-time delivery of the fire apparatus.” \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to require Sutphen Corporation to contractually bind itself to its commitment to deliver without delay.  Moreover, should delay in delivery occur, then the City will avail itself of all available legal remedies. \nTherefore, City Council will require that any contract with Sutphen Corporation include both a liquidated damages clause and the option for cancellation based on a failure to meet the delivery date, which is a material, fundamental and crucial term of the contract due to the significant apparatus needs of the City. For example, the contract could specify that the delivery date for this vehicle shall be xx months from date of contract; that any delivery delays occasioned by strikes, labor disputes, and/or quality changes due to the use of replacement workers will constitute a material breach; and that if a delivery delay occurs, the city will have the option of either cancelling the contract or receiving a credit in purchase price as liquidated damages for each and every day of late delivery.\nThis legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to issue purchase orders to The Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of Fire and EMS emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment.\nEmergency Designation: \nCurrent build times (14 months for the ladder) for the fire apparatus purchased in this ordinance require emergency action to ensure funds are encumbered immediately to allow for the production of these custom apparatus to commence upon passage of this ordinance and confirmation of the subsequent purchase orders.\nBid Waiver:\nDue to reasons referenced below and on the attached form, the Division of Fire requests a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes. \nThe apparatus from The Sutphen Corporation have been the Fire Division's standardized equipment for several years, as both the Divisions of Fire and Fleet Management believe these products are the best for their operations given the quality, durability and customizability each manufacturer offers, as well as the cost-effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with each manufacturer during the build process.  The subsequent contracts established by Fleet Management with each manufacturer have also simplified the managing of parts/service after purchase. \nThe Division of Fire requested quotes from three vendors for this apparatus purchase.  The Sutphen Corporation was the only responsive bidder.\nContractor:\nThe Sutphen Corporation ~ FID #310671786 / Vendor 004200 / SOS Entity 309414 \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Cash is available upon transfer from various projects within the Safety Voted Bond Fund for this purchase. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is also required \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $2,515,613.00 within various projects of the Safety Voted Bond Fund; to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into contracts with and issue purchase orders to The Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of one (1) Sutphen Heavy Duty 100’ Mid-Mount Aerial Ladder and related equipment, which would allow for cancellation and/or liquidated damages in the event of delayed delivery, such as those delays resulting from labor disputes; and to authorize the expenditure of $2,515,613.00 from the Safety Voted Bond Fund. ($2,515,613.00); and to declare an emergency\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a need exists within the Fire Division to purchase front line response rescue and fire apparatus and related equipment; and\nWHEREAS, a transfer of funds within the Safety Voted Bond Fund is necessary to fund this purchase; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds from the Safety Voted Bond Fund; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to issue purchase orders to The Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of a platform ladder and related equipment needed by the Division of Fire; and\nWHEREAS, a waiver to the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes is necessary as per the attachment to this ordinance; Now, Therefore:\nWHEREAS,  an emergency exists in the usual daily operation in the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to pass this ordinance due to the need to make funds available for the fire apparatus to be purchased, as it takes 14 months to complete the building of the ladder and for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. To authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to enter into contracts with and issue purchase orders to The Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of a platform ladder and related equipment and to include both a stipulated damages clause and a cancellation opt-out clause for late delivery in the contract, including delivery delays occasioned by strikes and/or labor disputes.\nSECTION 2.
