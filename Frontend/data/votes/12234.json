    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a professional services contract with Community Solutions Collaborative. LLC for the Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) project. The project will conduct an analysis to identify impediments to fair housing choice within the city of Columbus and identify actions to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through the analysis. \n \nThe Department of Finance and Management, Grants Management Section anticipates an annual entitlement funding award for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The CDBG entitlement program provides annual grants on a formula basis to cities and counties to develop viable urban communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and expand economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons. All City CDBG expenditures must be consistent with the community needs, priorities, and strategies stated in the City’s Draft HUD 2025-2029 Consolidated Plan, adopted by City Council as Ordinance #2968-2024, to be submitted to HUD for approval. \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, known as the Fair Housing Act, requires recipients of funds from HUD to affirmatively further the policies and purposes of the Fair Housing Act, also know as “affirmatively further fair housing.” The obligation to affirmatively further fair housing requires recipients of HUD funds to take meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected classes. \n \nThis ordinance is needed to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of a portion of the CDBG award and authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with Community Solutions Collaborative. LLC. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $160,000.00 from funding awarded to the City by HUD from Fund 2248.
