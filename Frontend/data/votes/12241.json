This grant extension will extend to October 31, 2025. The modification will allow See Brilliance to continue serving students impacted by the digital divide towards the beginning of the 2025-2026 school year.\n \nFor this grant agreement, funds were issued upfront. While the funds on the purchase order have been fully relieved, the dollars are not fully spent down as of May 15, 2025. To allow See Brilliance to spend these funds in compliance with the grant agreement and during the grant agreement term, the term of the grant agreement must be extended.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the grant modification to be executed prior to the agreement’s expiration.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to modify a grant agreement with See Brilliance by extending the grant agreement; and to declare an emergency.
