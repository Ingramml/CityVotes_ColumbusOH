    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: The Short North Alliance, Inc. (the “Developer”) is an Ohio non-profit corporation serving both the property owners and business owners of the Short North Arts District and surrounding area to nurture commercial corridors as vibrant, creative, and inclusive communities and leading arts destinations. Warren & High LLC and the Developer entered into a 75-year ground lease dated as of April 25, 2025 for a pocket park covering a 0.021-acre portion of Franklin County Tax Parcel ID No. 010-057234 (the “Initial Property”). The Developer desires for the City to establish a new community authority and new community district pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”) Chapter 349 at first over the Initial Property, and then to add through subsequent legislation additional territory owned or controlled by the Developer or other eligible persons (the “Additional Properties”) to the new community district. The purposes of the new community development program will be to collect community development charges from the Initial Property and Additional Properties to support the provision of community services already provided by the Developer but to also allow for activities related to land acquisition, land development, and community facilities within and without the community development district around the Short North neighborhood. On or about May 13, 2025, the Petition for the Establishment of the Short North New Community Authority under Ohio Revised Code Chapter 349 (the “Petition”) was filed by the Developer with the Clerk of City Council.
