    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize June 2021 as Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month and to Promote the Columbus Walk to End Alzheimer’s on September 26, 2021.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, every sixty-five seconds an individual develops Alzheimer's disease and it is the most expensive disease in America, costing the nation $355 billion this year; and \n \nWHEREAS, June 2021 is Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month, recognizing a disease that affects more than 6 million Americans and 220,000 Ohioans; and\n \nWHEREAS, as a degenerative disease, Alzheimer's is thought to begin 20 years before symptoms arise; and\n \nWHEREAS, recognizing these events provide an opportunity to promote and join the global conversation about the brain and Alzheimer’s disease as a public health crisis; and \n \nWHEREAS, caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease often takes an enormous toll on family members; caregivers themselves often suffer more stress, depression, and health problems than caregivers of people with other illnesses; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Alzheimer's Association is the largest non-profit funder of Alzheimer’s research and provides care and support to those living with the disease today with the help and support of its dedicated volunteers; and \n \nWHEREAS, we recognize the important role the Alzheimer’s Association, Central Ohio Chapter plays in meeting the needs of people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia through family and clinical support, early detection and diagnosis of disease education, advocacy and research; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Columbus City Council recognizes June 2021 as Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness Month and September 26, 2021 as the Columbus Walk to End Alzheimer’s Day.",
