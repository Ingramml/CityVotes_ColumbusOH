    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department modify an existing contract with Tyevco, Inc. to provide construction services associated with the Adventure Center Renovation 2024 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $200,000.00.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks’ Center for Therapeutic Recreation at Franklin Park has the unique mission of sponsoring recreational activities that are adapted to meet the needs of people with disabilities. In furtherance of that mission and to mitigate stigma, everyone is welcome to participate at the facility regardless of ability. For these reasons and the support of the Recreation and Parks Commission, City Council, and the Espy Family, this legislation requests to rename the Franklin Park Adventure Center to the Ben Espy and Kathy Duffy Espy Recreation Center. This legislation also requests additional funding to install signage that reflects this change, install new basketball gym goals, and additional flooring on the second floor. The original project completion date of the project was April 25, 2025. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will be December 31, 2025.  \n \nSenator Espy led a full life of dedicated and committed service as a remarkable statesman, loving father, and spouse. He was also a prolific football player for The Ohio State University under the legendary coach Woody Hayes. Senator Espy was an exceptional lawyer, who served our nation in the United States Air Force as an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate stationed at Hancock Field Air Force Base in Syracuse, New York. He also demonstrated his resilience in 1984 when he survived a life-threatening accident while on the way to a Columbus City Council meeting. A falling concrete cornice severed his right leg below the knee. After this injury, he said, “As long as you don’t have your spirit amputated, you will be okay,” once again proving his strength and persistence.\n \nSenator Espy was elected by his constituents as the first Black President Pro-tempore of the Columbus City Council. He served in this capacity for a decade. He later was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1992 and was voted assistant minority leader from 1994 to 1996. He was then elected minority leader from 1996 to 2000. He was the founder of the Columbus Youth Corps, which taught ethics and professionalism to young people. He and his wife Kathy opened a gymnastics school in the early 1980s on the East side of Columbus. This facility provided the opportunity for many inner-city youth to train and achieve outstanding collegiate careers.\n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $200,000.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: The scope of this project was limited originally to interior renovations. With Senator Espy's recent passing, there has been emergent requests to dedicate this space in his honor.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: The current contractor will be completing the previously approved work prior to the center’s summer 2025 programming. A new procurement process would result in the work for the dedication of this facility to impact already scheduled paid programming.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: Pricing was requested from the current contractor to perform the additional scope of work including signage replacements, memorial plaque, new basketball goals, and additional flooring on the second floor. These prices have been reviewed by the design consultant for accuracy and conformity. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTyevco, Inc.\n1678 West Audubon Boulevard\nLancaster, Ohio 43130\nJames Boggess, (614) 284-0251\nContract Compliance Number: 005691\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 1, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to complete the work prior to the summer 2025 scheduled programming.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The additional work being completed under this modification will add amenities and provide inspiration through the renaming of the center to honor Ben Espy and Kathy Duffy Espy.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: This additional work was requested by the community and participants in the Therapeutic Recreation Program.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Near East (56)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by updating one community park per year, strategically prioritizing center improvements, and maximizing the use of existing recreational facilities to enhance programming.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,024,905.00 was legislated for the Adventure Center Renovations 2024 Project contract by Ordinance 2484-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $200,000.00. $200,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,224,905.00.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Tyevco, Inc. for the Adventure Center Renovations 2024 Project; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to rename the Franklin Park Adventure Center to the Ben Espy and Kathy Duffy Espy Recreation Center; to authorize the transfer of $200,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $200,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
