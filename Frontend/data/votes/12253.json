    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a grant agreement with Star House to assist them in meeting the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth.  Star House is a non-profit corporation.\n \nFounded in 2006, Star House operates the nation’s only 24/7 drop-in center for youth experiencing homelessness that hosts continuous best-practice research and is the only housing village of its kind in central Ohio for college-age youth who are exiting homelessness. At central Ohio's only drop-in center, young people experiencing homelessness, ages 14-24, are provided with immediate access to safety, basic needs, and access to crucial, stabilizing resources.\n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests the authority to enter into a grant agreement with Star House so that they will support the wages of the Youth Advocates at the Star House Drop-In Center, a significant expense for a 24-hour per-day operation. This funding will make a meaningful impact in helping a large number of Columbus teens and young adults complete their education, escape homelessness, and become stable enough to thrive.\n \nThe needed services cannot be provided by existing city employees as the city has neither the knowledge or expertise in this area.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this grant agreement is available within the 2025 Mayor’s Office of Education General Fund budget. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a grant agreement with Star House, to assist them in meeting the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth; to authorize the transfer of $75,000.00 within the Department of Education General Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $75,000.00 from the general fund. ($75,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Star House operates the nation’s only 24/7 drop-in center for youth experiencing homelessness that hosts continuous best-practice research and the only housing village of its kind in central Ohio for college-age youth who are exiting homelessness; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds from the grant agreement will support Youth Advocates at the Star House Drop-In Center, helping them meet the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth; and \n \nWHEREAS, this grant agreement is being awarded to the Star House pursuant to Section 329.30 of Columbus City Codes, for which the city does not supply such services; and\n \nWHEREAS, this funding will help a large number of Columbus teens and young adults complete their education, escape homelessness, and become stable enough to thrive; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Star House to assist them in meeting the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the transfer of $75,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed in regard to the action authorized in Section 1, is hereby authorized within the General Fund 1000 from Dept-Div 40-06, Object Class 03 to Dept-Div 40-06, Object Class 05 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3. That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $75,000.00, is hereby authorized within the general fund per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That this agreement is awarded pursuant to the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes relating to the process for awarding not-for-profit service agreements.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 6. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 7. That this ordinance shall take effect from and after the earliest date allowable by law.",
