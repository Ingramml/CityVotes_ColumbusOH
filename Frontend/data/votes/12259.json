    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kalkreuth Roofing and Sheet Metal, Inc. for the SWWTP Raw Sewage Pump Building Roof Replacement project, CIP #650234-100201, in an amount up to $987,045.00 and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $989,045.00. \n \nThe Raw Sewage Pumping Building houses critical equipment for the successful operation of Southerly Water Reclamation Plant. The existing roofing system is exhibiting signs of failure and requires replacement. The project will replace the roof, edge metal, and lightning protection on the Southerly Water Reclamation Plant Raw Sewage Pump Building to ensure the plant remains operational.\n \nPlanning Area - 59- Southwest\n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 210 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.  \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $987,045.00, including a 15% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                               $987,045.00\n \nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $987,045.00\nPrevailing Wage Charge                          $    2,000.00\n                                                                                          $989,045.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThere is no expected economic impact related to this project outside the direct work associated with the roof replacement. No community outreach was completed during development of this replacement project. The entire Southerly Water Reclamation Plant would fail to function if the raw sewage pumps were damaged by water intrusion, so the environmental impacts of failing to execute this work are substantial for the citizenry of Columbus.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 12/20/2024 through 1/29/2025.   Four bids were received:\n \n     Name                                                                                                            Bid Amount                                          City/State                                           Status \nIBI 1 LLC                                                                                                          $  215,000.00                                          Columbus, OH                                           MBE\nKalkreuth Roofing and Sheet Metal, Inc.                                          $  987,045.00                                           Columbus, OH                                           MAJ\nGeneral Maintenance & Engineering Co.                     $1,122,975.00                                          Columbus, OH                                          MAJ\nHarold J.
