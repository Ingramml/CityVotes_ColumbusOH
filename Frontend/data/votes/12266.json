    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes a grant in the amount of $129,830.00 between the City of Columbus’ Department of Building and Zoning Services (BZS) and Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio, a 501(c)(3) Not for Profit to support the construction of the first of two new homes in east Columbus beginning August 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026.\n \nHabitat for Humanity - MidOhio’s mission is seeking to put God’s love into action to bring people together to inspire hope, build homes, empower families, and develop communities.\n \nAccording to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition's (NLIHC) 2023 annual report, the available and affordable housing stock continues to shrink. There's a 6% increase in the shortage of affordable and available housing since 2022. The report reveals a ratio of only 26 affordable units available for every 100 extremely low-income households. To close this gap, more than 52,000 affordable units need to be built in Columbus.\n \nStarting in the 2025-26 school year, construction trades students from Fort Hayes Education Center will work alongside Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio construction staff leads to build the first of two new homes in east Columbus in partnership with local Habitat partner families. The Fort Hayes Education Center offers half-day career-technical education courses in health, construction, media arts, performing arts, visual arts, and transportation-related programs. All classes are available on campus to prepare students for jobs in their community and beyond.  \n \nThe homes will be built on City-owned lots located on Old Leonard Avenue. The properties are a walkable distance from the school, allowing for easy access for the students and eliminating a historically challenging barrier to workforce development programming - transportation. The construction schedule will overlay the students' school year and is expected to take around seven months. Students in specialties like masonry, carpentry, or welding will have the opportunity to practice those skills on the build site.  \n \nThe past partnership between Habitat-MidOhio and Fort Hayes will be reengaged through this home build with a strategic focus on providing hands-on construction experience in coordination with the students' curriculum. By partnering with Habitat, the students will also learn about the affordable housing crisis facing our community and have the opportunity to be part of the solution. By building this, and other homes, Habitat-MidOhio strives to be a leader in connecting people to opportunity and hope by obtaining and maintaining homeownership.  \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding in the amount of $46,428.56 is available within the 2025 Development Services Fund 2240 budget for transfer to supplement the $83,401.44 available in the Special Purpose Fund, Fund 2223, Construction Trades Education Subfund 222351.\n \nGrant Recipient:  Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio, Not for Profit Vendor #004859\nCertification #: CC-004859  Exp. 1/27/2027.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of $46,428.56 from the Development Services Fund to the Special Purpose Fund; to authorize appropriation in the Special Purpose Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a not-for-profit grant agreement with Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio to support the construction of the first of two new homes; and to authorize an expenditure of $129,830.00 from the Special Purpose Fund, Construction Trades Education Subfund.
