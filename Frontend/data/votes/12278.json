    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing contract with Azteca Systems, LLC to provide additional software licenses for the Cityworks Asset Management System (AMS). The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $61,406.30.\n \nCityworks AMS is used as a department wide Asset Management solution and is replacing Oracle WAM. The software contract is an annual Enterprise licensing agreement that includes cloud-hosting services. The Cityworks solution modernizes our Work and Asset Management program by enabling best practices and GIS to empower DPU to better track, maintain, and manage assets across our entire organization. Cityworks provides three hosting environments, which include one each for testing, production, and development. The Department of Public Utilities (DPU) has 718 licenses and is requesting to increase its licenses by 150 additional logins. Additionally, the Division of Fire currently has 282 licenses funded by DPU and uses these licenses in collaboration with the Division of Water to support the maintenance and inspection process for Fire Hydrants across the City.\n \nThe initial contract term was established in accordance with the pertinent provisions to waive for competitive bidding of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code and authorized with Ord. 2517-2022. Services under the original contract cover a one (1) year period from date of execution with the option to renew annually for an additional five (5) years on a year-to-year basis, or a portion thereof, based on mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds and approval of Columbus City Council. Ord. 2833-2024 authorized the second renewal extending the contract expiration date through November 13, 2025 and adding funds for the initial 1,000 licenses through this period.  For the new 150 licenses, they will be prorated from May 2025 through November 2025, each new Cityworks license prorated cost is approximately $409.38. This contract shall not automatically renew. All other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. \n \nDue to a Request for Proposal (RFQ018791) that was published for the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to obtain an Asset Management System, Woolpert, Inc. was the awarded firm and the software solution they chose in the proposal was Cityworks. It has been determined that establishing one contract for services with Woolpert, Inc. and one contract for software directly with Azteca Systems, LLC (Cityworks) is the best path forward, and it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a contract with Azteca Systems, LLC. \n \n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification is $61,406.30.  Total contract amount including this renewal is $1,420,266.30.\n \n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  Additional users are now required to have a software license for the CityWorks Asset Management System.\n \n3. Reason other procurement processes were not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time. \n \n4. How was cost determined:  The cost, terms, and conditions are negotiated based on the quantity of users. The cost for this modification was provided by written quotation and is $61,406.30. The additional yearly licensing cost for these 150 new software licenses will be included in future pre-authorized renewals.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nAzteca Systems, LLC\n11075 South State Street, Suite 24\nSandy, UT 84070\nMichael Romano, (262) 751-6767                                         \nContract Compliance Number: 041096\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: 04/11/2026\n \nFiscal Impact: $61,406.30 is available from within the Public Utilities Operating Funds to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n$556.860.00 was spent in 2024\n$421,000.00 was spent in 2023\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a contract, in accordance with the pertinent provisions to waive competitive bidding of Columbus City Code, with Azteca Systems, LLC. for additional software licenses for the Cityworks AMS System for the Department of Public Utilities; and to authorize the expenditure of $61,406.30 split between the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds.
