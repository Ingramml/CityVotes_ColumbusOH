    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for development of a 177-unit affordable housing development in an amount up to $4,800,000.00.  Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity to Nelson Park Preservation Associates LLC.  Assignment is subject to approval of ownership and control documentation by the City Attorney’s Office.\nMHP Nelson Park, Inc. is the administrative member of the managing member (Nelson Park Manager LLC) of Nelson Park Preservation Associates LLC.  MHP Nelson Park, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Metropolitan Housing Partners, Inc. and Metropolitan Housing Partners, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) and CMHA will hold title.  In addition to being co-owners of the project as members of Nelson Park Preservation Associates LLC - Renewal Housing Associates LLC, The Orlean Company and CMHA - are all co-developers of the project.\n \nNelson Park Apartments involves the acquisition and rehabilitation of an existing 177-unit affordable housing development in the Eastgate neighborhood on the near east side of the City of Columbus. The property was originally constructed in 1958 and has been identified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office and the National Park Service (NPS) as a historically significant asset as one of the first housing developments in the United States developed using financial assistance from the Section 221 program and has been listed on the National Historic Register. The property has not received a substantial rehabilitation since 1980 when it was brought into HUD’s Section 8 sub-rehab program. The project currently includes 47 residential buildings with one, two and three-bedroom townhomes serving both families and seniors, 100% of which are covered by a HUD Section 8 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contract. Preservation of this asset for the near east side community is critically important as rents and home values continue to escalate while affordability continues to decline. The current owner of Nelson Park Apartments, The Orlean Company, and its development partners, Renewal Housing Associates, and the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority, have prepared a comprehensive, multifaceted redevelopment plan not only to ensure the long-term viability and affordability of Nelson Park Apartments, but also to ensure that the housing provided on the site better serves both its residents and the surrounding community.  \nHistorically, due to existing restrictions on the property, Nelson Park has had limited financial resources to address the current issues in a meaningful and lasting way making this redevelopment plan both necessary and urgent. Importantly, the development team has received HUD approval of this redevelopment plan, which requires a complex financial restructuring involving the movement of a Mark-to-Market Use Agreement, an 8bb HAP transfer and a Mark-Up-to-Market application. \nDue to its size, building obsolescence and resident mix, Nelson Park has been challenging to manage, operate and maintain effectively. It has been the scene of numerous episodes of violence and crime. Therefore, as part of the redevelopment plan, the overall footprint and population of the property will be reduced from 47 residential buildings to 42 residential buildings and from 177 units to 140 units. Post-rehab, there will be 14 elderly buildings with four (4) 1-BR units in each and 28 family buildings with two (2) 2-BR units and one (1) 3-BR unit in each. Primarily through the adaptive reuse of three buildings on the far west end of the site, the residential site plan will be condensed so that the property will be easier to manage and so that residents will have easy access to the new community building, management office building and maintenance garage, and amenities that will be provided. New lighting and an enhanced security system, along with a reduction in the number of curb cuts and ingress/egress points on the property, will further improve safety and security for both the residents and the surrounding neighborhood. \nThe property is in a neighborhood poised for redevelopment and that has seen increasing property values because of targeted and strategic redevelopment efforts, including the opening of a new Amazon Distribution Center immediately abutting the property, as well as the Creekside Apartments around the corner on Nelson Road. The property currently serves many extremely low-income households, including families with children and seniors, but as part of the redevelopment plan, the property will also serve homeless and formerly homeless individuals referred by the Community Shelter Board (CSB). Residents will benefit from a service package that seeks to improve health and wellness, educational and workforce outcomes for individuals and families. Residents will also continue to benefit from a Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) Bus Stop on the property at the corner of Nelson Road and Maryland Avenue, as well as the 30-acre park (Nelson Park) managed and maintained by the City’s Recreation and Parks Department that provides immediate access to athletic fields, basketball courts, playgrounds, a shelter house, lighted walking trails and the Alum Creek Greenway bike trails. Importantly, all existing residents at the property will remain at the property and during the rehab, temporary relocation will occur on site minimizing disruption of the lives of residents. No permanent relocation or displacement will occur as a result of the redevelopment. \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule and to meet deadlines for this project that are set forth by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding in the amount of $4,800,000.00 is available in 2024 Capital Improvement\nBudget, Affordable Housing Bond fund. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 006216 and expires 09/8/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority(CMHA) in an amount up to $4,800,000.00; to authorize CMHA to assign the agreement to Nelson Park Preservation Associates LLC as the administrative member;  to authorize the expenditure of up to $4,800,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund in support of the acquisition and redevelopment of  Nelson Park Apartments;  and to declare an emergency.
