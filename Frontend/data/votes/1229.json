    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Department of Finance and Management requests establishing a Special Revenue Fund entitled “Sustainable Columbus Fund”, which is authorized to accept funds from AEP Energy, Inc. in connection with the Community Choice Aggregation program known as Clean Energy Columbus enacted by the City of Columbus. \nThe Clean Energy Columbus program allows the City of Columbus to pool together the retail electrical loads of their residents and small businesses to contract for energy on their behalf. This process, known as Governmental Aggregation or sometimes Community Choice Aggregation, provides an opportunity for residential and small business consumers to participate collectively in the potential benefits of electricity deregulation, which include, but are not limited to, competitive electricity rates, increased consumer choice, an increased demand for renewable energy to help grow the industry, and a 100% renewable energy supply - which means a healthier and more equitable living environment for Columbus residents. \nTo achieve these benefits, Ordinance 1642-2020 authorized the City of Columbus to perform all necessary actions to effect a Governmental Electricity Aggregation program for the City with opt-out provisions pursuant to Section 4928.20 of the Ohio Revised Code. The City added this program to the ballot on November 3, 2020 and it was approved by the majority of the electors, as required by law.\nPursuant to the authority granted by Ordinance 1642-2020, the City entered into a Governmental Aggregation Master Retail Electric Supply Agreement with AEP Energy, Inc. This Master Supply Agreement provides for the supply of electricity for City of Columbus program participants, both residential and commercial. In addition, this agreement includes in its overall generation supply rate a Community Grant fund rate for all retail electric supply that is consumed and paid for by customers participating in the Community Choice Aggregation program. These funds will be paid to the City on a monthly basis by AEP Energy, Inc.\nProceeds from these receipts shall be used to provide a range of energy management and alternative energy initiatives to benefit the greater Columbus community. Some of these initiatives may include but are not limited to the following: community education and outreach, grants, infrastructure investment, energy efficiency projects, training, workforce development, administrative costs incurred by the City, and other activities related to clean energy, energy efficiency, and sustainability initiatives. \nFISCAL IMPACT: Community Grant proceeds will be deposited into this Special Revenue Fund to be used for clean energy, energy efficiency, and climate-action sustainability initiatives. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to create a Special Revenue Fund titled Sustainable Columbus Fund for the purpose of depositing proceeds received from AEP Energy, Inc. in connection with the Community Choice Aggregation program; such funds shall be used for the purpose of promoting energy management and alternative energy initiatives; to appropriate an amount up to, but not to exceed, the cash in the fund not encumbered for any other purpose; and to authorize the expenditure of said funds received for such purposes.  \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Finance and Management seeks to establish a Special Revenue Fund titled “Sustainable Columbus Fund” which is authorized to accept funds from AEP Energy, Inc. in connection with the Community Choice Aggregation program known as Clean Energy Columbus; and \nWHEREAS, the purpose of this Special Revenue Fund is to provide support to a range of clean energy, energy efficiency, and sustainability initiatives to benefit the greater Columbus community.
