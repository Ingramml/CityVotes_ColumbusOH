    "description": "Title\n \nTo Honor and Celebrate Elyot L. “LaMont” Ransom on the Occasion of His 80th Birthday\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Ransom Company, a cornerstone of the Columbus community, was founded in the late 1890s by Benjamin Ransom as a coal and ice delivery service by horse and buggy. In the 1940s, the business passed to his son Lewis, who, alongside his wife Martha and their children, expanded its services and strengthened its foundation; and\n \nWHEREAS, Elyot L. Ransom, affectionately known as LaMont, joined his father Lewis in the family business during the 1960s as a third-generation associate, eventually becoming its owner and further expanding operations into residential and commercial demolition; and\n \nWHEREAS, over the course of more than 60 years, LaMont worked alongside numerous family members-partnering with major inner-city initiatives, supporting City of Columbus projects, and completing over 4,000 demolitions, leaving a lasting impact on the community; and\n \nWHEREAS, he not only helped reshape the physical landscape of Columbus but also contributed to Black business leadership, local economic development, and mentorship in the trades. LaMont Ransom has become known not only as a devoted businessman, but also as a man of unwavering faith, integrity, kindness, and friendship, respected by all who know him; and\n \nWHEREAS, now at the remarkable milestone of 80 years of life, LaMont Ransom continues to be an inspiration to family, friends, and the entire Columbus community, exemplifying a life of purpose, service, and dedication; and\n \nWHEREAS, we recognize and honor LaMont’s outstanding contributions, his enduring legacy, and his steadfast commitment to faith, family, and community.\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That we extend our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to Elyot L. “LaMont” Ransom on the joyous occasion of his 80th birthday. May he be blessed with continued good health, love, and fulfillment in the years to come.",
