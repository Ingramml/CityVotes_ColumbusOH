    "description": "Title\n \nTo Commemorate the 15th Anniversary of the I Know I Can Founders’ Scholarship\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, I Know I Can (IKIC) was founded in 1988 through the vision and leadership of Art Kobacker, Teckie Shackelford, Clifford Tyree, Sr., and Bob Weiler, who believed that no child in Columbus should be denied the opportunity for higher education due to financial limitations; and\n \nWHEREAS, Over the past 15 years, the I Know I Can Founders’ Scholarship has stood as a beacon of equity, opportunity, and hope-empowering students from Columbus City Schools to pursue their postsecondary goals and fulfill their potential; and\n \nWHEREAS, since its inception, the Founders’ Scholarship has supported 253 scholars (not including the 2025 class), providing nearly $8.5 million in scholarship aid-offering recipients up to $10,000 per year-and establishing a network of high-achieving students who are now contributing to communities locally and across the country; and\n \nWHEREAS, this initiative has been made possible through the generosity and commitment of 32 corporate and organizational donors, 64 individual donors, and 12 higher education partners, forming a community of support around Columbus students; and\n \nWHEREAS, this merit-based scholarship is awarded to students who demonstrate exceptional academic achievement and promise, with recipients holding an average GPA of 3.8, achieving a graduation rate of 89%, and 70% qualifying for Pell Grants**-a testament to the scholarship’s transformative impact; and\n \nWHEREAS, Founders’ Scholars have pursued higher education at institutions such as The Ohio State University, Otterbein University, Ohio Wesleyan University, a range of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and Ivy League schools, representing Columbus with excellence across the nation; and\n \nWHEREAS, On the occasion of its 15th Anniversary, we recognize the Founders’ Scholarship not only as a source of financial aid, but as a symbol of belief in the potential of students, and a driver of educational equity and future leadership;\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That we celebrate the enduring impact of the I Know I Can Founders’ Scholarship, commend the scholars past and present, and express deep gratitude to all who have contributed to its success.
