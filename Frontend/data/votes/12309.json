    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND\n \nDistrict 6 of the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is currently accepting applications for funding from ODOT’s Urban Paving program.  This program provides funds for eligible surface treatment and resurfacing projects on state and U.S. Routes within municipal corporations.  An annual allocation is set statewide and distributed to each of ODOT’s 12 districts based on each district’s \"City State and U.S.  Route System\" mileage.  Funding is provided on an 80-20 basis with the local governments providing the 20% match for project construction costs, however, locals are encouraged to provide more than 20% to stretch the amount of available funds.  ODOT District 6 recently implemented an application process to request Urban Paving funds.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to request Urban Paving program funds; accept and expend grant funds from the Ohio Department of Transportation; to execute those documents necessary to accept the grant; to administer the grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of that award; and to refund any unused funds after the grant period ends if final accounting determines a refund is owed.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure will be submitted to Council for the awarded grant funds and to encumber and expend necessary matching City funds.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service plans to submit applications for the following projects:\n \n530282-100168 - Resurfacing - Urban Paving FRA-33-18.85 (Livingston Ave & College Ave).  This project will perform mill/resurface, partial/full-depth pavement repairs, ADA ramp upgrades, curb repair, and pavement marking and loop detector replacement.  Project Location: US-33 (Livingston Ave and College Ave) from Nelson Rd (SLM 20.14) to I-70 (SLM 21.93).  Approximate construction cost is $2,609,616.\n \n530282-100167 - Resurfacing - Urban Paving FRA-40-12.50 (Broad St).  This project will perform mill/resurface, partial/full-depth pavement repairs, ADA ramp upgrades, curb repair, and pavement marking and loop detector replacement.  Project Location: US-40 (Broad St) from Front St (SLM 12.50) to Nelson Rd (SLM 15.27).  Approximate construction cost is $4,238,771.\n \n530282-100177 - Resurfacing - Urban Paving FRA-62-17.66 (Nelson Rd).  To perform mill/resurface, partial/full-depth pavement repairs, ADA ramp upgrades, curb repair, and pavement marking and loop detector replacement.  Project Location: US-62 (Nelson Rd) from Broad St (SLM 17.66) to E.  5th Ave (SLM 18.99).  Approximate construction cost is $675,000.\n \n(This listing is meant to be illustrative and is believed to be accurate and complete; however, last minute project additions and substitutions are at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.)\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  A local match is not anticipated based on funding opportunity for this type of project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to prepare and submit Urban Paving Program applications to the Ohio Department of Transportation; to execute agreements, accept and expend grant funds related to the Urban Paving Program; and issue refunds if necessary after final accounting is performed.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation is accepting applications for Urban Paving program funds;
