    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance 0352-2025, passed by Columbus City Council on April 21, 2025, to authorize further appropriations and expenditures in support of Latino Heritage Month programming. These funds were not yet identified at the time of the original ordinance's passage.\n \nThe Office of Councilmember Barroso de Padilla has identified $30,000.00 in additional funding to support Latino Heritage Month programming, and the Office of the Mayor has identified another $10,000.00. Because the original not-for-profit contract authorized by Ordinance 0352-2025 has not yet been executed, an amendment is preferred rather than a contract modification.\n \nThis amendment also specifies that the fiscal management fee for Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio is up to 15 percent.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $30,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018, as well as $10,000.00 within the Department of Finance's citywide account, subfund 100010. Ordinance 0352-2025 originally authorized an expenditure of $50,000.00.\n \nREASON FOR EMERGENCY: Asociacion de Escritores de Ohio needs to be able to disburse funds to community partners in a timely fashion and well in advance of the September-October event timeline in order to ensure seamless programming.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance 0352-2025, passed by Columbus City Council on April 21, 2025; to authorize a transfer within the general fund; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
