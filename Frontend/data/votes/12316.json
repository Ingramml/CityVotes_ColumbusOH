    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with REALM Collaborative, LLC to provide professional services associated with the Busch Park Ball Diamond Improvements 2025 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $58,974.50, with a contingency of $7,500.00, for a total of $66,474.50\n \nThis project was originally for improving fields 3 and 4 at Anheuser-Busch Sports Park and the design is underway. This modification is to expand the project to include fields 1 and 2.\n \nThe opportunity presented itself for the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department to put in a bid to be the host city for the 2026 North American Gay Amateur Athletic Association's Gay Softball World Series. This tournament is the largest annual LGBTQ+ single-sport, week-long athletic competition in the world. This tournament would bring participants from 54 cities across North America to Columbus. In order to secure this high profile event for the city, this additional investment in the park is required prior to the start of the 2026 softball season.\n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $66,474.50\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: In July 2024, during an on-site visit between the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department and iPRIDE leadership, a discussion regarding additional playing locations for other national tournaments iPRIDE may wish to host was brought up. From this conversation, the decision was made to utilize funding to fully upgrade fields one through four at Busch Park and convert them to turf fields.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: Any changes to the early spring 2026 deadline would greatly impact programming and other organizations that have utilized the Busch Park fields for many years. 2026 adult sports programming at Busch Park will begin mid-April and will entail softball and kickball leagues utilizing fields five days and nights per week. Based on previous years, there are more than 100 projected league games to be played at Busch Park during April in 2026. These games cannot be moved as Berliner Park will also be full with leagues during the week and tournaments on weekends. Additionally, there are multiple longstanding leagues that have been utilizing Busch Park exclusively for many years. These include Columbus Lesbian and Gay Softball Association, iPRIDE's local chapter, SkiClub, Restaurant League, and Northwest League. These groups often secure Busch Park as a site for their pre-season practice needs as well, which is not included in the league games total previously mentioned.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The hourly rates previously established in the original contract were used the cost for the additional services.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nREALM Collaborative, LLC \n100 East Broad Street, Suite 1710 \nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nCarmine Russo, (330) 324-3739 \nContract Compliance Number: 021146\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: April 3, 2027\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order for design work to be completed by late summer 2025 and the construction phase completed by spring 2026.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by providing enhanced ball diamonds that will allow for additional programming and tournaments. The turf fields will allow for more games to be played on a high level surface without the impact weather brings to dirt fields.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Input for this improvement project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports and Leisure International and managed by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Northwest (34)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to update sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $98,409.37 was authorized for the Busch Ball Diamond Improvements 2025 Project contract by Ordinance 2486-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $66,474.50. $66,474.50 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 and Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $164,883.87.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with REALM Collaborative, LLC for the Busch Ball Diamond Improvements 2025 Project; to authorize the appropriation of $30,312.56 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the transfer of $66,474.50 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund and Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $66,474.50 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund and Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
