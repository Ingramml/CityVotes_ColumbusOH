    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Burgess and Niple, Inc. for the Mound Street Floodwall and WCLLP Repairs, CIP #611708-100000, in an amount up to $494,964.53.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD), initiated CIP 611708-100000 to address the existing concrete floodwall located along the east side of the Scioto Trail, between Main Street and the Norfolk Southern/CSX railroad bridge, in the vicinity of the Miranova condominium tower.  The wall has deteriorated significantly.  Exposed reinforcing steel has created a safety risk, the crumbling concrete is an eyesore, and continued deterioration may lead to the failure of the floodwall.  This Project will also address the spalling and cracked panels of the existing concrete wall sections along the West Columbus Local Protection Project (WCLPP), also known as the Franklinton Floodwall. \n \nThe initial phase of work for this Project involved reviewing historic data and completing field investigations associated with the existing concrete floodwall located along the east side of the Scioto River, between Main Street and the Norfolk Southern/CSX railroad bridge.  Following the initial data review and field investigations, recommendations were prepared for the rehabilitation and/or repair of the Mound Street Floodwall and the damaged WCLPP panels.\n \nThis planned contract renewal will fund the design and development of plans for the rehabilitation and/or replacement of the existing Mound Street wall.  It will also design and develop plans for effective and sustainable repairs to those panels of the WCLPP which exhibit significant spalling and cracking to prevent their failure.\n \nThe Community Area for this project is 37 - West Scioto, 54 - Franklinton, 55 - Downtown, 59 - Southwest, and 69 - Harmon Road Corridor.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $494,964.53\nCost summary: \nOriginal Engineering Agreement   (ORD 1255 - 2020; PO235328)                      $249,934.26\nModification No.1 (current)                                                                                                                                $494,964.53\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                          $744,898.79\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process to do the initial study and then develop design plans.  This contract modification is done to add funding to develop the design plans.  Since this modification was planned and explained in the original ordinance and contract, another procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nAn estimate was developed based on existing contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  This estimate was reviewed by the City’s project team, and the project team then negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project is required to maintain flood protection to over four square miles of protected area.  The project will also repair and improve the aesthetics of the deteriorated concrete floodwall on the east side of the Scioto Trail south of Main St. \n \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nBurgess and Niple, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004425 and expires 1/10/26.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Burgess and Niple, Inc. is classified as a majority owned company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  As part of their proposal, Burgess and Niple, Inc. has proposed two subcontractors to perform contract work.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 5.5%.\n \nCompany Name                                                                                                           City/State                                ODI Certification Status \n2LMN, Incorporated                                                                                                          Columbus, Ohio                                           MBE\nBarr Engineer Incorporated                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                           MBE\n \nThe certification of Burgess and Niple, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA June Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the OWDA Board approving the loan application.\n \nThe 2024 Capital Improvements Budget will need to be modified to align budget authority with the proper project; and funds will need to be appropriated and expended in the Storm - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6224.\n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Burgess and Niple, Inc., for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Burgess and Niple, Inc., and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Burgess and Niple, Inc., for the Mound Street Floodwall and WCLLP Repairs project;
