    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to accept the award for the 2024 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant, G602100, in the amount of $109,891.22 from American Municipal Power, Inc. (AMP), and it authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of the 2024 grant award to accelerate the City’s conversion from high-pressure sodium lights to light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures. The ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the following current and pending Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements listed below for the Division of Power, and lastly, it authorizes the City Auditor to transfer funds in the amount of the 2018 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant from the Electricity Grants Fund to the Electricity Operating Fund. The transfer is necessary because the approved expenditure for the 2019 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant used operating funds and the Electricity Grant Fund maintains the cash from that award. \n \nUNIVERSAL TERM CONTRACT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS:\nLamps (Line #10)\nStreet Lights (Line #10)\n \nVENDORS:\nCrescent Electric Supply Company, vendor #012052, cc exp 3/14/27 majority\nConsolidated Electrical Distributors, Inc., vendor #010270, cc exp 5/4/25, majority\nThe Loeb Electric Company, vendor #006028, cc exp 8/1/26, majority\nPEPCO, vendor #006514, cc exp 2/15/26, majority\nW.

Funds are unused if market renewable energy certificate (REC) prices are lower than anticipated. \n \nThe Division of Power (DOP) street light system has around 59,000 streetlights. DOP has been converting these from high-pressure sodium lights to light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures, and thus far, around 10,000 lights (18%) have been converted. The EcoSmart award will allow approximately 90 additional decorative post and top conversions and 220 standard cobrahead models, or some combination thereof.\n \nExpenditures of prior year EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant awards contributed to DOP’s SMART Street Lighting Project, an offer of smart thermostats to customers in connection with the ongoing Enhanced Meter Project, and installation of solar photovoltaics (PV) as part of a low- to moderate-income co-op program.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT  \n \nDOP is eligible for $109,891.22 for the 2024 EcoSmart Choice program year. This ordinance authorizes an appropriation of this same amount from the Electricity Grants Fund to accelerate the City’s conversion from high-pressure sodium lights to light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures.\n \n \n$2,808,934.30 was spent on lamps in street lights in 2024\n$917,031.04 was spent in 2023\n \nSeparately, $50,366.00 will be transferred from the Electricity Grants Fund to the Electricity Operating Fund because the approved expenditure for the 2019 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant used operating funds and the Electricity Grant Fund maintains the cash from that award. ACPO004638 is the encumbrance of grant funds, while the approved expenditure used operating funds through PO205197.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to accept the 2024 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant Award in the amount of $109,891.22 for the Division of Power; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $109,891.22 from the Electricity Grants Fund to support the City’s streetlight conversions; to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate current and pending Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements, and to authorize the City Auditor to transfer $50,366.00 within the Electricity Grants Fund and $50,366.00 from the Electricity Grants Fund to the Electricity Operating Fund.
