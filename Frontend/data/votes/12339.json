Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year contract for fiscal years 2023 - 2025 for which modifications were anticipated pursuant to the original authorizing legislation under Ordinance 0956-2023 to account for future construction projects being assigned to Stantec Consulting Services Inc. for inspection services.  Those future construction projects were not known when the contract was put into place.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for future construction projects that bid during the three-year (2023-2025) time frame.  Those future construction projects were not known when the contract was put into place. \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Stantec Consulting Services Inc. and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will construct a 30” sanitary sewer from the intersection of Coffey Rd & Woody Hayes Dr to the intersection of Kenny Rd & Woody Hayes Dr within a lane of the Woody Hayes roadway to serve the Innovation District and vicinity.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nStantec Consulting Services contract compliance number is CC-000462 and expires 7/26/2025.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  Stantec Consulting Services is classified as a majority owned company by ODI.  The subcontractor Stantec Consulting Services proposes to use for this contract is DHDC.  DHDC is classified by ODI as a City-certified MBE company and is projected to perform 5.75% of the work on this contract modification.\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status  \nDHDC, Inc.                                              Columbus, Ohio                                              MBE\n \nStantec Consulting Services and all subcontractors were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n  \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2720-2024, passed by Council on 10/28/24.  The loan is expected to be approved in June, 2025.  Funds will need to be certified against the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to proceed with this project until the loan has been approved.  \n \nFunds will need to be appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, transferred to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, and then appropriated in the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the WPCLF and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to reflect the loan funding for this project.  \n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested in order to begin construction as soon as possible this summer to ensure the active work zone is situated farther from the stadium during this fall’s football season. This will help minimize safety risks associated with pedestrian traffic near the stadium during football games.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Stantec Consulting Services Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract;
