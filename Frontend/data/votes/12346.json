Grant Ave. Columbus, Ohio 43215 to The Commons at Grant (TC2) Senior Housing Limited Partnership.  It was recently discovered that the name listed in the ordinance was incorrect as a clerical error occurred in adding “Senior” to their name.  The legal name, as registered with the Ohio Secretary of State, is “The Commons at Grant (TC2) Housing Limited Partnership”.  Upon further review and discussions with The Commons at Grant Limited Partnership it was deemed that actually the conveyance of the title of the property will need to be with The Commons at Grant Limited Partnership and not The Commons at Grant (TC2) Housing Limited Partnership.”  The Commons at Grant Limited Partnership will upon closing of all financing will transfer the property to “The Commons at Grant (TC2) Housing Limited Partnership.   All other aspects of the ordinance remain the same.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to correct this error to assure that progress with conveyance of the title is not hindered in any way and the proper documentation can be reflected within their recorded files.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 3349-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on December 16, 2024, to allow for a correction of the name listed within the ordinance from “The Commons at Grant (TC2) Senior Housing Limited Partnership” to “The Commons at Grant Limited Partnership”; and to declare an emergency.
