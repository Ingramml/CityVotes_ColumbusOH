    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract for Bonfire Strategic Sourcing Platform Site License for Unlimited Users, with Euna Solutions, Inc.  This subscription-based software allows City employees to solicit, receive, and evaluate RFPs and BVPs in an online procurement system.  The system allows users to organize and distribute documents with digital scorecards for online evaluation and makes vendor submissions easier and more compliant with a simple uploading experience.  This platform is administered by the Purchasing Office and is made available to City staff, allowing them to become a user and publish and review RFPs and BVPs for purchases using this process.  The City has used this software since 2018, but separate agreements for licensees were entered into by each agency who had users. As of 2024, there were a total of thirty-four (34) user licenses contracted by all City agencies.  By entering into the new, unlimited-user license agreement, the City will be able to increase availability of the software to more users at a reduced cost per license.  \n \nThe Finance and Management Department, Purchasing Office, respectfully requests a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes to continue the City’s use of this particular software and its relationship with Euna Solutions, Inc The waiver is requested to maintain continuity of this procurement system and there is not enough time available for a formal bid process, as the current contract for department-by-department licenses expires June 12, 2025. The term of the proposed contract will be one year with an expiration date of June 12, 2026.  \n \nEuna Solutions, Inc. - CC052723 - Pending Review\n \n \nEmergency Designation:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency measure to insure there is no interruption of Bonfire software services.\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Parties listing of the Federal Government and are not listed in the Auditor of States database for Findings for Recovery.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $168,813.16 to Euna Solutions, Inc. for the cost of the one-year unlimited license subscription of the Bonfire Strategic Sourcing Platform.  These funds are budgeted various funds for various departments.  In 2024, $143,813.16 was expended for this service by all agencies who used the previous contract for Bonfire.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into a one-year contract with Euna Solutions, Inc., for unlimited licenses to use the software solutions and professional services related to the Bonfire Strategic Sourcing Platform; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $168,813.16; and to declare an emergency.
