    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various contracts to provide PASSPORT home care and assisted living services for older adults in Central Ohio for the first year of a two-year period beginning July 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025.\n \nThere are currently 664 PASSPORT and assisted living agencies that provide services to older adults in accordance to the Ohio Department of Aging contracting requirements (See attachment). PASSPORT (Pre-Admission Screening System Providing Options and Resources Today) is a Medicaid-funded program that provides home care services as an alternative to nursing home admission and currently serves 8,700 individuals.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:\nEmergency action is requested in order to meet the conditions of the grant so that providers can be paid within 30 days of providing service, and so that services can continue beyond June 30, 2025.\n \nThis ordinance is contingent on the passage of Ordinance 1344-2025. \n \nPRINCIPAL PARTIES:\nSee attached list of 664 providers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n$86,516,252.00 is required from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund to enter into contracts.\n \nWAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING:\nA bid waiver is requested for these contracts in order to comply with the PASSPORT Administrative Agency (PAA) rules and regulations set forth in the grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Aging (ODA) and Ohio Department of Medicaid (ODM) as defined by OAC 173-39. COAAA, as the PAA for Central Ohio, is required to enter into contract with all ODA-certified PASSPORT providers within the Central Ohio service area within 60 days of certification. This requires COAAA to enter into contract with new providers more regularly than the competitive bidding process will allow. While this Ordinance authorizes COAAA to enter into contract with PASSPORT provider for the period of July 1, 2025, to December 31, 2025, ODA will continue to certify providers on a rolling basis throughout this period. It is essential that COAAA maintain flexibility to enter into these contracts to remain compliant with the stipulations set forth in the grant agreement with the ODA, ODM, and Ohio Administrative Code. In order to comply with the PAA agreement in a timely manner, COAAA is asking for the authority to enter into additional contracts as they are certified by ODA prior to seeking City Council approval.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into contracts with the agencies listed on the attachment hereto for the provision of Pre-Admission Screening System Providing Options and Resources Today (PASSPORT) home care and assisted living services for older adults in Central Ohio for the period of July 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025; to authorize the expenditure of $86,516,252.00 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
