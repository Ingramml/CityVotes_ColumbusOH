    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into a one-year contract with Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital for the amount of $345,130.00 to provide domestic violence support services related to the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) program in partnership with the Columbus Division of Police.  The Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) officially launched as a co-response pilot partnership between The Center for Family Safety and Healing (TCFSH) and Columbus Division of Police (CPD) in May of 2023. ACT-DV advocates respond on domestic violence runs with CPD officers. Officers secure the scene and focus on interviewing, reporting writing and evidence collection while advocates listen to survivors and provide triage safety supports.\n \nBy February 2024, the ACT-DV program expanded to two of the six CPD zones.  It is the goal of the Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and the Columbus Division of Police to expand the ACT-DV co-response as the standard protocol for all domestic violence / intimate partner violence cases involving firearms and/or strangulation.\n \n \nBid Waiver Justification: A bid waiver is being requested in order to keep the consistency with the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) program.  Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital created the  Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) alongside the Columbus Division of Police. It is important to keep the continuity of these relationships and trust between the Columbus Division of Police, Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and the program participants.  A new vendor would have to come in and start from the very beginning to obtain this knowledge, understanding, and trust.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is being requested so that the contract can be entered into as soon as possible to prevent a lapse in domestic violence support services being provided to residents in need.\n \nFiscal Impact: \nThe amount of $345,130.00 is budgeted for this purpose in the 2025 General Fund operating budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into contract with Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital for domestic violence support services related to the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) program in partnership with the Columbus Division of Police; to authorize the expenditure of $345,130.00 from General Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.  ($345,130.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into a contract with Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital for services related to the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) partnership with the Columbus Division of Police; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $345,130.00 from the General Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the Office of Violence Prevention to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, pursuant to Section 329.15 of the Columbus City Codes, because this vendor has intrinsic knowledge and understanding of the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) program and its evolution providing continuity of service; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Violence Prevention in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into a contract with Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital for services related to the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) program, to ensure these needed services continue, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention is authorized to enter into a one-year contract with Center for Child and Family Advocacy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital for services related to the Advocacy Crisis Team (ACT-DV) program in an amount not to exceed $345,130.00.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $345,130.00, or so much thereof as may be needed in regard to the action authorized in Sections 1, is hereby authorized from the General Fund 1000, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this Council finds it in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15, to enter into this contract and does hereby waive said competitive bidding provisions.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.  \n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
