This contract will provide services through May 31, 2026. The contract anticipates a duration of fourteen (14) years beyond this contract modification with an optional five (5) year extension. The contract is anticipated to end in the 4th quarter 2040, or 4th quarter 2045 if the optional five (5) year extension is used. Each year a contract modification is anticipated to be legislated in the 2nd quarter to fund the contract.\n \nPROCUREMENT:  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids through the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from September 3, 2021 for this project in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code (RFQ018958). One (1) bid was received. \n \nThe proposed contract amount is $5,300,000.00 for the modification #1. Subsequent annual contract modifications are anticipated to provide funding.  Cost will be based on a service fee that includes a unit cost per dry ton of water treatment residuals beneficially used per year. The contract incorporates pricing adjustments associated with corresponding economic indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the duration of the term. The pricing adjustments and increase in quantity over the contract duration is the basis of the annually increasing costs. \n \nThe project will extend the life of the MAQ for residuals disposal and improve the sustainability of DOW’s WTR management methods by diverting a significant portion of the WTR to beneficial uses.  Almost all work will be conducted in areas not accessible to the public, so DOW does not anticipate conducting community outreach for this project, but can do so if the need arises.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the first modification of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #1 is $5,300,000.00.
