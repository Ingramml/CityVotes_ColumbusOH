($3,986,097.62).\n \nThis project will construct a 30” sanitary sewer from the intersection of Coffey Rd & Woody Hayes Dr. to the intersection of Kenny Rd & Woody Hayes Dr. within a lane of the Woody Hayes roadway to serve the Innovation District and vicinity.\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 44-University District.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 365 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $3,984,097.62, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                       $ 3,984,097.62\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                       $0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                           $      2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                               $ 3,986,097.62\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe OSU West Campus development is a mixed-use redevelopment project that incorporates approximately 210 acres of land generally bounded by Lane Avenue to the north, Kinnear Road to the south, Kenny Road to the east, and Northstar Avenue to the west.  The West Campus Infrastructure Study performed for OSU looked at alternatives and recommended that sanitary sewage for the project area be directed to the Clinton No. 3 sewer.  In addition to providing additional sewage collection capacity to OSU the project would also allow for future connection of privately owned properties at the NE corner of Lane Avenue and Kenny Road currently served by septic treatment systems.  \n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Clinton Sewer District Number 3, OSU Carmenton District Sewer Extension project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 03/19/25 through 04/16/25.  One bid was received for the project and was opened on 04/16/25.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                                          Bid Amount          Compliance Number       \n1.

A transfer of cash and appropriations is needed in the Sanitary Bond Fund as is an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.\n7.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested in order to begin construction as soon as possible this summer to ensure the active work zone is situated farther from the stadium during this fall’s football season. This will help minimize safety risks associated with pedestrian traffic near the stadium during football games.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Complete General Construction Company, for the Clinton Sewer District Number 3, OSU Carmenton District Sewer Extension project; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund; to authorize the appropriation of funds within the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $3,986,097.62 from the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund and the Sanitary Bond Fund to pay for the project; and to declare an emergency.
