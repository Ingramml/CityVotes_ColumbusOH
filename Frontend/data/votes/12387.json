    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key 4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc., and to declare an emergency. (0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend two (2) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTC) for the option to obtain Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key 4 Supply Inc., CC#049181 expires 5/21/2026 and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc., CC#005749 expires 12/28/2025.  These contracts provide sanitary paper products for various City of Columbus agencies.  This modification is necessary to ensure a contract is available so that sanitary paper products and dispensers are supplied to city agencies without interruption.  \n \nThese contracts, PO260894 (Key 4 Supply Inc.) and PO260908 (Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc.) were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ016972 and authorized under Ordinance Number 0121-2021 and will expire June 30, 2025.\n \nThere are no changes in the type of products being procured.  The original contract was formally bid.  The original terms and conditions of the previous contract remain in effect. The the contracts will expire on June 30, 2025 and there is not enough time to do a formal bid process to award a new contract. The City cannot go without sanitary paper products which are used in restrooms and other areas throughout City facilities.  These items are needed for safety hygiene and the prevention of spreading germs and diseases.  It is therefore imperative that the contracts be modified to allow for an extension through September 30, 2025 to ensure these products are readily available through these suppliers.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation  be considered an emergency because the current contract expires June 30, 2025 and sanitary paper products are needed throughout various city facilities.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contracts.  Citywide agencies must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key 4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc., and to declare an emergency. (0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into two (2) Universal Term Contracts for Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers for use by citywide agencies; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing Universal Term Contracts with Key 4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc., and, to ensure sanitary paper products and dispensers are available.\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City agencies, as the current contracts expire on July 1, 2025, in that it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts because the current contract expires June 30, 2025 and to maintain a continual supply of sanitary paper products and dispensers, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts to obtain Sanitary Paper Products and Dispensers with Key 4 Supply Inc., and Carmen’s Distribution System, Inc,. for a period of three (3) months, from July 1, 2025 to and including September 30, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
