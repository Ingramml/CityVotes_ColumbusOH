    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every Columbus child has access to a safe after-school environment to continue his/her education at the end of the school day.\n \nAccording to the Harvard Family Research Project and its national database of evaluations, research confirms that “children and youth who participate in after-school programs can reap a host of positive benefits in a number of interrelated outcome areas-academic, social-emotional, prevention, and health and wellness. These are the skills that many suggest are necessary for youth to succeed in the 21st Century global economy and world.”\n \nDuring the 2024-2025 school year, the After School Grant Program provided effective support and services for 2,200 children. The Mayor’s Office of Education plans to serve the same number of children for the upcoming 2025-2026 school year.\nTherefore, the Office of Education requests permission to enter into a grant agreement with the below after-school program providers to help us reach our goal - and the Mayor’s vision for Columbus. Contracts are being awarded to the below providers pursuant to Section 329.30, which allows for the City to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts. These providers were selected due to their prior experience and success in providing the same services in the 2024-2025 school year.\n \nAsian American Community Services, INC\nBoys and Girls Clubs of Columbus, Inc. dba Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Ohio\nFranklin County Historical Society dba Center of Science and Industry (\"COSI\")\nCentral Community House of Columbus\nClintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center\nAfter-School All-Stars Ohio \nThe Columbus Urban League \nCommunities In Schools Of Ohio \nCommunity For New Direction Incorporation \nDirections For Youth & Families, Inc. \nEducational Service Center of Central Ohio\nEthiopian Tewahedo Social Services \nKaleidoscope Youth Center, Inc.\nSt. Stephen's Community House\nTech Corps Ohio\nThe Young Mens Christian Association Of Central Ohio  \nThe Young Women's Christian Association\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:Funding for this grant agreement ($312,000.00) is budgeted and available within the 2025 Office of Education General Fund budget. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Office of Education to enter into a grant agreement with various non-profit organizations to provide after-school programs and services; to authorize the transfer of $312,000.00 within the Office of Education General Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $312,000.00 from the general fund.
