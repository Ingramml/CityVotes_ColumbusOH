    "description": "Explanation                     \n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify the existing contract for Effectiff LLC. The contract currently provides telephone interpretation services for Columbus Public Health. This ordinance authorizes a contract modification with Effectiff LLC to add American Sign Language (ASL) video remote interpreting (VRI) services to the contract Scope of Services as a secondary option in the event of technical issues with the primary provider, Sign Language USA LLC, for the period of April 1, 2025 to March 31, 2026. There are no changes to the contract dollar amount, which is $50,000.00. The current contract was authorized by Ordinance 0230-2025. The contract period is from April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026. \n \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires recipients of Federal financial assistance to take reasonable steps to make their programs, services, and activities accessible by eligible persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). As our LEP clients increase we must increase our resources to properly serve them. \n \nIt would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes as specified in Columbus City Code 329 because these are ongoing services, a break of which would be detrimental to the wellbeing of our clients, and the underlying contract was previously awarded via RFP. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT There are no changes to the contract amount. The current contract is already budgeted in the 2025 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract, by adding American Sign Language (ASL) video remote interpreting (VRI) services to the contract Scope of Services with Effectiff LLC who provides language services ($0.00). \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to modify the Scope of Services for an existing contract for language services with Effectiff LLC. The total amount for the contract does not change; and\n \nWHEREAS, Effectiff LLC has the expertise required to carry out those services; and \n \nWHEREAS, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires recipients of Federal financial assistance to take reasonable steps to make their programs, services, and activities accessible by eligible persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP); and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Board of Health to authorize Columbus Public Health to modify the contract with Effectiff LLC for language services; and NOW THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify the Scope of Services for existing contract for language services with Effectiff LLC. The total amount for the contract does not change. \n \nSECTION 2. That these contract modifications are in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
