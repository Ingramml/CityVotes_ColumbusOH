($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Auditor to create a new fund and subfund for the Water Division to account for donations received to support utility discount programs managed by the Department of Public Utilities. \n \nThe newly established “Columbus Cares Utility Assistance Subfund” within the newly established Water Special Revenue Fund is designed to accept donations in support of existing and future utility discount programs. Current initiatives include income-based and senior discounts, offering eligible customers reduced water and sewer usage charges, one-time bill credits and waivers of service fees. The establishment of the new fund and sub fund is necessary to ensure proper accounting and transparency in the receipt of donations and the disbursement of assistance to individuals experiencing financial hardship. All donations will be used exclusively to assist eligible residential customers.  \n \nOnce the fund and subfund are established, individuals and businesses will have the opportunity to support the fund through round-up donations, recurring contributions and/or one-time donations. The fund will be administered by the Department of Public Utilities and additional information, including how to donate will be available once the program is fully formed. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Donation proceeds will be deposited into this new special revenue fund subfund to support utility discount programs. Utilizing a special revenue fund provides the best means for properly tracking and accounting for these donations. \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: Emergency designation is requested so that the fund and subfund can be created as quickly as possible to allow the Department of Public Utilities to begin accepting donations without delay. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to create a special revenue fund titled Water Special Revenue Fund and sub fund titled Columbus Cares Utility Assistance Subfund for the purpose of accepting donations to support existing and future utility discount programs; and to declare an emergency.
