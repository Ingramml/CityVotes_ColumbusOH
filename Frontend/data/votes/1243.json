    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Human Resources, to enter into an agreement and establish a purchase order with 3SG Plus LLC for the final phase of development and implementation of a Claims and Document Management and Safety Incident Tracking system. This purchase is being done through the utilization of State of Ohio, State Term Schedule contract STS033, #534577, with an expiration date of 6/30/2023. The total contract agreement amount is $19,289.12 (which includes $1,500.00 in contingency funding)\n \nOn November 5, 2018,  Ordinance  2672-2018 authorized  the  Director  of  the  Department  of  Technology, on behalf of the Department of Human Resources (HR), to enter into   an   agreement   and   establish purchase orders, via  state  term  schedules,  with  3SG  Plus  LLC,  and  Hyland  OnBase,  for  which  3SG  Plus LLC is a dealer. The purpose of the agreement was to develop and implement a Claims and Document Management and  Safety  Incident  Tracking  system.    However,  after  the  initial  project  assessment,  HR decided it was in the city’s best  interest  to  refocus  elements  of  the  project  and  thus  have  spent  the  past several months considering what best  suits  the  department’s  needs.  Due  to  this  redirection,  the  funds authorized  by  Ordinance  2672-2018 and  established  on purchase order PO150758 remain largely   unspent. Ordinance 2763-2019 extended the purchase order for a period of one year  to  continue  the  existing agreements  with  3SG  Plus,  LLC  and  Hyland  OnBase.  The  term  was  for  a  period  of  one  year,  starting on December 18, 2019 and ending on December 17, 2020.\n \nDoT is requesting this authorization on behalf of the Department of Human Resources, Risk Management section, where the claims management system is being developed and implemented. The introduction of the citywide payroll system Dayforce presented an opportunity for an enhanced integration with the claims system further increasing efficiencies and ease of system maintenance.  \n \nThis ordinance will also authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Human Resources, to enter into agreement with 3SG Plus LLC given the extensive work already performed by 3SG Plus LLC on development of the Claims Management System, it is in the City’s best interests to utilize State of Ohio, State Term Contract STS033 #53477 with an expiration date of 6/30/2023. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: 3SG Plus, LLC\nFID/CC #: 31-1586115, Expiration Date: 3/22/2023\nDAX Vendor #: 011844\nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to expedite authorization of this agreement/purchase order modification and extension in order to facilitate and maintain uninterrupted services from the vendor and so that these funds can be made available at the earliest possible date to avoid project delays.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Human Resources, to enter into a contract and establish a purchase order with 3SG Plus LLC for the final phase of development and implementation of a Claims and Document Management and Safety Incident Tracking system.; to authorize an expenditure of $19,289.12, which includes $1,500.00 in contingency funding, from the Information Services Division, Direct Charge Budgeted Fund; and to declare an emergency.
