    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract, on behalf of the Facilities Management Division, with NALCO Water, (previously, Barclay Water Management) for water treatment and remediation services. During the Covid-19 pandemic, occupancy levels in various facilities were significantly reduced due to remote working by employees and reduced visitation from the general public. These reduced occupancy levels drastically lowered the throughput of water through various buildings' water systems. A lower volume of water flow throughout a facility’s water system can provide an environment conducive to the growth of various water contaminants. \n \nIn response, the Facilities Management Division partnered with the Human Resources Department, Division of Occupational Safety & Health to establish a program for the safe testing, treatment and remediation of City owned water systems. NALCO Water's expertise and partnership with local health care systems, as well as their skills, equipment, and experience determined that they were best positioned to meet the City’s needs. NALCO Water, (previously Barclay Water Management), is currently under contract with the Department of Finance and Management, Facilities Management Division in such capacity. While occupancy levels have increased as the pandemic has waned, the Facilities Management Division has determined that it is still best practice to continue with the water treatment services to safeguard the health and safety of employees and visitors.\n \nThis ordinance seeks to authorize a contract with NALCO Water and to provide for the option to renew this contract for two (2) successive annual terms.\n \nNALCO Water, FID: 82-4607045\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested so that these water testing, treatment, and remediation services can continue without delay to safeguard the health and wellness of City employees and visitors alike.
