    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the Three Creeks Wetland Restoration Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $80,300.00.\n \nThree Creeks Park is a 1,097 acre park in the Far South Community and is jointly managed by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department and Franklin County Metro Parks. Three Creeks Park was historically farmed, but wetlands have been developing over the past decade as the land has naturally converted from agricultural use. It is important that the Recreation and Parks Department restores the wetlands at Three Creeks Park, as approximately 90 percent of all wetlands in Ohio have been lost. Wetlands improve water quality, provide flood control, serve as critical habitat for a variety of wildlife, and capture carbon dioxide. \n \nDuring the initial design contract, the consultants determined that additional parkland could be converted to wetlands using low-cost construction methods. As a result, additional cultural resource phase 1 investigations were needed to comply with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources grant requirements. The consultant also determined that additional efforts are required to obtain final permits for construction. This included the need for an additional permitting report that includes hydraulic and hydrology modeling. The report shows that the proposed project will not impact the Federal Emergency Management Agency base flood elevation. This modification additionally includes professional services needed during construction, including site visits, requested reviews, and general staff support during construction. The consultant provided additional hours they would need to complete the additional work. The contract has established hourly rates that were used to determine the price for the modification. The original project completion date of the project was June 30, 2025. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will be March 31, 2026.  \n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $80,300.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: The additional services needed were not foreseen during the original project scoping because it was assumed those permits were not required. The project team learned of the additional permit requirements after the first draft of documents were submitted for review. The construction support services were foreseen, but were not negotiated until later in the project when the needed support during construction could be better estimated.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: The best interest of the City is served by awarding these additional services through the existing contract due to the existing consultant’s in-depth understanding of the project needs and involvement to date. As a result, modifying the consultant's contract is more cost efficient and will keep the project on schedule.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The consultant provided additional hours they would need to complete the additional work. The contract has established hourly rates that were used to determine the price for the modification.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCivil & Environmental Consultants, Inc.\n250 West Old Wilson Bridge Road, Suite 250\nWorthington, Ohio 43085\nBradley Petru, (614) 540-6633\nContract Compliance Number: 001963\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: June 11, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order complete the design plans and bid the construction project on schedule, meeting the grant funding deadline of spring 2026.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Wetlands improve water quality, flood control, and serve as critical habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Restoration of wetlands at Three Creeks supports the Urban Forestry Master Plan with tree plantings. Additionally, the project will provide recreational opportunities for the community in a currently inactive part of the park.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community, Far South Area Commission, and the Williams Creek Homeowners Association has expressed support for the wetland restoration and will continue to be involved during the design phase of the project.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far South (64)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the City’s natural resources and overall environmental health, benefiting current and future generations of residents.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $182,643.35 was legislated for the Three Creeks Restoration Project by Ordinances 0723-2024 and 1678-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $80,300.00. $80,300.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund 2223, Subfund 222355 and Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $262,943.35.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. for the Three Creeks Wetland Restoration Project; to authorize the appropriation of $80,300.00 within the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund, Subfund and Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the transfer of $4,079.11 within the Recreation and Parks and Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $80,300.00 from the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund and Permanent Improvement Fund; and to declare an emergency.
