    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten. Kindergarten readiness is a multidimensional construct reflecting young children’s preparedness for instruction in areas related to both academic and social-emotional skills. Children who arrive to kindergarten with limited readiness in one or more of these areas face challenges in the transition into the kindergarten setting, and are susceptible to academic achievement over time.\n \nParticipation in quality early childhood education can provide an important mechanism for developing children’s school readiness; likewise, certain intentional parenting practices, such as shared book-reading and numeracy discussions, also can support school readiness. However, not all children have access to quality early learning programs and/or intentional parenting practices.\n \nBecause of this, the Mayor’s Office of Education is requesting the authority to partner with Columbus Early Learning Centers (CELC), a non-profit corporation, on the Summer Success Program, an eight-week summer intensive learning readiness program focused on pre-kindergarten children without prior early childhood education experience and those who may not have sufficient support at home for developing key kindergarten readiness skills.  The Summer readiness camp is scheduled to begin June 10, 2025. \n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests permission to contract with CELC to provide this crucial work.\n \nThis contract is being awarded pursuant to City Code Chapter 329, which allows for the City to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts.  This organization was selected due to their existing contract with the City to serve as the master operator of the Hilltop Early Learning Center (HELC) and their experience in providing quality early learning programs.  Existing city employees lack the requisite skill to provide the services needed.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract ($175,000.00) is available within the 2025 Office of Education General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract, pursuant to Columbus City Codes, with Columbus Early Learning Centers to plan and implement the 2025 Summer Success Program, an eight-week summer intensive learning readiness program focused on pre-kindergarten children without prior early childhood education experience needed for developing key kindergarten readiness skills for the achievement of the Mayor’s goal that every child is ready for kindergarten; and to authorize the expenditure of $175,000.00 from the General Fund. ($175,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Mayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten; and \n \nWHEREAS, participation in quality early childhood education can provide an important mechanism for developing children’s school readiness; and \n \nWHEREAS, not all children have access to quality early childhood education and/or intentional parenting practices; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Summer Success program assists pre-kindergarten children that have not participated in early childhood education and may not have developed key kindergarten readiness skills; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Education and Columbus Early Learning Centers seek to plan and implement the Summer Success Program to assist pre-kindergarten children in developing key kindergarten readiness skills; and  \n \nWHEREAS, this contract is being awarded pursuant to City Code Codes Section 329.30, which allows for the city to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding was budgeted in the General Fund within the Office of Education’s operating budget for this purpose; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Mayor’s Office of Education to authorize the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Columbus Early Learning Centers; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Office of Education is authorized to enter into a contract with the Columbus Early Learning Centers for the planning and implementation of the Summer Success Program, an eight-week summer intensive learning readiness program focused on pre-kindergarten children without prior early childhood education experience needed for developing key kindergarten readiness skills. \n \nSECTION 2. That Council authorizes this contract to be entered into pursuant to Section 329.30 of the Columbus City Codes regarding awarding not-for-profit service contracts.\nSECTION 3. That the expenditure of $175,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized to be expended from the General Fund as follows:  (See attachment EXP)\n \nDiv.: 40-06 | Fund: 1000 | SubFund: 100010 | Obj. Class: 03 | Main Acct: 63920 | Program: ED001 | Amount: $175,000.00\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 5. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.
