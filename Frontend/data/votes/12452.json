    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\n                     \nThis Ordinance is submitted to settle the lawsuit captioned Sierra Simmons v. City of Columbus, et al., United States District Court Case No. 2:24-cv-1550, in the amount of Two Hundred and Ten Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($210,000). \nThe lawsuit was brought by Plaintiff Sierra Simmons against the City of Columbus and police officers Chase Rogers and Randall Beam. The lawsuit arises out of the April 3, 2023 detention and arrest of Simmons. On or about April 3, 2023, Simmons arrived at 390 Chittenden Avenue in Columbus, Ohio to look for her children. Columbus police, including Rogers and Beam, were already at the residence responding to a reported stabbing. Upon her arrival Simmons approached the house, an active crime scene, and walked onto the porch. Officers informed Simmons of the existence of the crime scene and gave her orders to leave the area. Simmons eventually walked down the porch steps and back onto the pathway connecting the sidewalk and the porch, with the assistance of Rogers. Because Simmons was still on the property and had not left the crime scene, Rogers made the decision to detain her for misconduct at an emergency. Rogers, with the assistance of Beam, used a level 1 grounding technique and successfully handcuffed Simmons while she was on the ground. Simmons suffered a facial injury as a result of the takedown.  In her lawsuit, Simmons alleges excessive force during her arrest and physical injuries as a result. This ordinance would allow settlement and resolution of all claims relating to the April 3, 2023 arrest. \n Fiscal Impact:                       \nThis ordinance authorizes the settlement of a lawsuit captioned Sierra Simmons v. City of Columbus, et al., United States District Court Case No. 2:24-cv-1550; Funds were not specifically budgeted for this settlement; however, sufficient monies are available within Finance’s Citywide Account for this purpose.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Attorney to settle the lawsuit captioned Sierra Simmons v.
