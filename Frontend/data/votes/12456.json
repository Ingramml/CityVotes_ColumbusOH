    "title": "To rezone specific properties within certain City of Columbus corridors to one of the following mixed use districts: UGN-1 and UGN-2, Urban General District, and CAC, Community Activity Center District.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe Columbus Zone In Initiative (“Zone In”), a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and Official Zoning Map, began in 2023 with the “Where Do We Begin” report, which identified that the initial phase of Zone In should focus on 140 miles of key corridors. These “Main Streets” were identified as having the greatest potential to deliver critically needed housing, support enhanced mobility options, and create employment opportunities in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable. The initial locations were based on a number of factors including existing land use and development policy; current base zoning and overlays; existing conditions; proximity to current and planned COTA routes and proposed LinkUS bus rapid transit alignments; and site-specific circumstances.  \n \nPhase One was implemented on July 29, 2024, with City Council rezoning approximately 12,300 parcels into one of the newly created mixed-use districts, and enacting Title 34, the 2024 Zoning Code, which defines the new districts. After having worked with Title 34 for nine months, it was determined that an update to Phase One consisting of map amendments and minor revisions to the code would be beneficial.  \n \nIn the initial stages of identifying priority corridors to rezone parcels into new mixed-use districts, 62 focus areas emerged as top candidates based on strong alignment with the factors listed above. Certain parcels along or adjacent to State Route 161 (SR-161) were identified as meeting the criteria for the Community Activity Center (CAC) and Regional Activity Center (RAC) districts as defined in Title 34, and therefore, were rezoned as part of Phase One. Other portions of the SR-161 corridor did not initially appear to fit the guidelines for the new districts due to the absence of sidewalks, existing conditions, and the lack of a recommendation for mixed-use development in the previously adopted Northland I Area Plan (2014). \n \nSince the passage of Phase One, portions of SR-161 which include parcels along or adjacent to SR-161 between the Worthington City limits to the west and Ponderosa Drive to the east (the “Northland Community portion”), had been further examined by the Zone In project team. This portion abuts two areas that have been recently rezoned into Title 34 mixed-use districts. In addition, the Northland Community Council, along with other business and civic groups, have expressed much support for rezoning these parcels into Title 34 districts.  \n \nOn March 10, 2025, City Council approved Resolution #0030X-2025, accepting the Phase One Update proposal and initiating a sixty-day public comment period. Notice to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public was provided through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, and social media. The proposed map was made available on the project website allowing for area specific input. \n \nOver 300 comments were received during the review period with the majority being supportive of the proposal. Columbus City Council held the first public hearing on April 14, 2025, and the second public hearing on May 28, 2025. Further comment on the proposal by the general public could be provided at these hearings, with input summarized at the second hearing. \n \nThis ordinance rezones 160 parcels into Title 34 district designations including: Urban General (UGN-2) and Community Activity Center (CAC). Specific parcel designations are illustrated by Exhibit A: Proposed Mixed Use Zoning Districts Map, and Exhibit B: SR 161 Mixed Use Zoning Districts Parcel Lists. Upon the effective date of this ordinance, existing base zoning will be replaced by these new districts.\n \nIncluded with this Phase One Update are the incorporation of two parcels that were to be rezoned to UGN-1, Urban General District and CAC, Community Activity Center District with the Phase One mapping Ordinance, #2113-2024. The parcels were reflected on the Exhibit A maps, but were not included on the Exhibit B parcel lists included with that ordinance. Exhibit C of this ordinance depicts these edits in order facilitate the map corrections.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo rezone specific properties within certain City of Columbus corridors to one of the following mixed use districts: UGN-1 and UGN-2, Urban General District, and CAC, Community Activity Center District.\n \nBody \n \nWHEREAS, Phase One of the Columbus Zone In Initiative, a multi-phase effort to update the City’s zoning code and Official Zoning Map, began in 2023 with a focus on 140 miles of key corridors, with the creation of a modern zoning code that promotes a sustainable, equitable city, through support for housing, small businesses, equity, and connected communities; and    \n \nWHEREAS, in the initial stages of identifying priority mixed-use corridors to be included in Phase One of Zone In, 62 focus areas emerged as top candidates based on strong alignment with certain factors including existing land use and development policy; current base zoning and overlays; existing conditions; proximity to current and planned COTA routes and proposed LinkUS bus rapid transit alignments; and site-specific circumstances; and  \n \nWHEREAS, portions of SR-161 were identified as meeting the criteria for the CAC and RAC districts, as defined by the new Title 34, and, therefore, were included in Phase One, while other portions of the SR-161 corridor did not initially appear to fit the guidelines for the new districts; and  \n \nWHEREAS, since the passage of Phase One, the Northland Community portions of SR-161, which include certain parcels along and adjacent to SR-161 between Worthington City limits to the west and Ponderosa Drive to the east that abut newly rezoned parcels, have been further examined by the Zone In project team, and have received significant support from the business and civic community for rezoning these parcels; and \n \nWHEREAS, the project team has determined that this portion does meet the criteria for the placement in CAC and UGN-2 districts, based on the following: development priorities that support the creation of new housing and mixed use development; current base zoning that restricts these priorities; availability of existing COTA routes; planned construction of new pedestrian friendly infrastructure; and under-utilized properties, use limitations, and lack of uniform design standards; and   \n \nWHEREAS, Resolution #0030X-2025 was adopted by Columbus City Council on March 10, 2025, accepting the proposal, declaring its intention to proceed with rezoning certain properties from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to new Title 34 district designations, and launching a sixty-day public review and comment period; and\n \nWHEREAS, notice of proposed map and code updates was provided to applicable reviewing bodies, property owners, and the general public through a variety of means, including a mailing to impacted and adjacent property owners, in-person presentations, email distribution lists, interactive website information, and social media posts; and\n \nWHEREAS, over 300 comments on the proposed map amendments for the Zone In Phase One Update 161 Corridor / Northland were received during the two-month public comment period; the majority of which indicated support for the proposed district placement; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council held  the first public hearing on April 14, 2025, with the second public hearing on May 28, 2025, wherein further comment on the proposal by the general public could be provided; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary and appropriate for the general welfare of the residents of the City of Columbus to proceed with the rezoning of 160 parcels from existing Title 33 zoning district designations to Title 34 2024 zoning district designations as a Zone In Phase One Update, and to incorporate two parcels inadvertently omitted from Zone In Phase One; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Official Zoning Map of the City of Columbus, as adopted by Ordinance #0179 -03, passed February 24, 2003, and as subsequently amended, is hereby revised by changing the zoning of the properties depicted on the attached Phase One Update maps (Exhibit A), and described by the parcel numbers in the attached Phase One Update lists (Exhibit B), and the properties depicted on the attached Phase One corrections maps and parcel list (Exhibit C) from their existing zoning classifications to one of the following mixed use districts, as indicated therein: UGN-1 and UGN-2, Urban General Districts, and CAC, Community Activity Center District, said districts detailed in Title 34, the 2024 Zoning Code.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services be, and is hereby, authorized and directed to make the said changes on the said official zoning map in the office of the Department of Building and Zoning Services.\n \nSECTION 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
