    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the City of Columbus, to enter into a professional service agreement with Columbus City Schools (CCS) for the continuation of its collaborative partnership for the provision of VoIP services.\n \nOrdinance 2557-2017 (and all exhibits) passed by City Council on October 30, 2017, established an on-going collaborative partnership between the city and CCS. As the city expands its VoIP solution, services and equipment are made available to the schools and the schools are, in turn, reimbursing the city for incurred costs.  These costs include maintenance and license renewals, phone and data charges, staff augmentation, etc. \n \nThe city will continue to maintain, support, and revise the shared VoIP solution hosting environment and provide 24-hour Tier 2-4 resolution support, and remotely support CCS Tier-1 with deployment, operations and provisioning of IP phones and the VoIP solution. The specific responsibilities of each party are spelled out in associated exhibits attached to this ordinance.  The coverage period begins on July 1, 2025, and ends on June 30, 2026.\n \nFinally, as part of this agreement, DoT may transfer surplus VoIP enabled phone units to CCS. As such, the ordinance also authorizes waiver of Columbus City Codes section 329.34 relating to the sale of city owned personal property. DoT is currently phasing out and upgrading its phone units and has the ability to direct surplus units, no longer needed by the city to CCS, should that be found to be a viable and cost-effective option.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency designation is required to due to the pending expiration of the current VoIP contract at the end of June.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe funds are to be deposited into a special subfund, created expressly to account for payments and expenditures. Periodic appropriations from the unappropriated balance of this subfund are sought as needed and as funds are received by the city. The City of Columbus will be reimbursed up to $192,271.00 for services provided.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the City of Columbus, to enter into a professional agreement with Columbus City Schools (CCS) for the continuation of its collaborative partnership for the provision of VoIP services; to authorize the waiver of Columbus City Codes, relating to the sale of city owned personal property; to authorize the reimbursement of up to $192,271.00 by CCS to the city for said services; and to declare an emergency.

That the payment received from Columbus City Schools as a result of the agreement will be deposited into fund 5100, subfund 510010, and that expenditures from this subfund will be limited to the subfund’s purpose.\n \nSECTION 4. That this agreement will become effective for one year beginning on July 1, 2025, and ending on June 30, 2026. (See attachment 1024-2025 Agreement)\n \nSECTION 5.
