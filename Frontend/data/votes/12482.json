    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, to enter into a sole source contract with NextGen Healthcare Inc. for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical records system.\n \nThe original agreement was authorized by Ordinance 1489-2014, passed July 21, 2014. It was most recently renewed and authorized under the authority of Ordinance 1776-2024, passed July 1, 2024. This ordinance authorizes continuing services for the term period of August 1, 2025, to July 31, 2026, at a cost of $401,605.00.\n \nThe Health Department initially used the NextGen system through Mount Carmel Health Systems. It was determined, however, that additional functionality was needed. As such, the Health Department contracted with NextGen directly in 2014. The hosted NextGen system enables the Columbus Public Health Department to operate five major clinical operations, which provide an extensive array of services. These services include patient registration, appointment scheduling, monitoring and tracking of patient test results, creation and processing of electronic medical records, and generation of reports to help manage clinic operations. This ordinance also requests approval to enter into the above-mentioned contract agreement in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, as it has been determined that NextGen is the sole provider of direct hosted NextGen systems and is the sole owner of NextGen software.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $401,605.00 for the above-described services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract are available and budgeted in the Information Services Operating fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: NextGen Healthcare Information Systems\nVendor Acct:# 045882 \nExpiration Date: 6-29-2025\n \nEMERGENCY\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation. The current contract expires on July 31, 2025. To ensure a contract for the provision of the above described services is in place by the time the current contract expires, emergency action is necessary. A lapse in service would negatively affect critical patient services that are provided by the Health Department.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, to enter into a sole source contract with NextGen Healthcare Inc. for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical record system, in accordance with sole source provisions in the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $401,605.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($401,605.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, to enter into a contract with NextGen Healthcare Inc. for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical records system for the amount of $401,605.00 for the term period of August 1, 2025, to July 31, 2026; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has been determined that NextGen Healthcare Inc. is the sole provider of direct hosted NextGen systems and is the sole owner of NextGen software; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted in accordance with sole source provisions in the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with NextGen HealthCare Inc. for a term of one year as the current contract expires July 31, 2025, on behalf of the Health Department, for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical record system, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with NextGen Healthcare Inc. for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical records system for the coverage term period from August 1, 2025, to July 31, 2026, at a cost of $401,605.00 in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nSECTION 2. That the total expenditure of $401,605.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized to be expended from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund, as follows in the attachment to this ordinance: (see attachment 1597-2025EXP).\n \nSECTION 3. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for any contract or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
