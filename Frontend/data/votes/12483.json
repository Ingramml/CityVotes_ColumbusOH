    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify and increase the construction contract with Elford, Inc., for the CDBG Neighborhood Facilities Renovation - All THAT Teen Center project, in the amount of $396,386.19. \n \nWork under the original construction contract (PO449206) included roof repairs, minor plumbing, mechanical and electrical work, and partial pavement/curbing/apron repairs.\n \nModification No. 1 (current) is needed to upgrade the facility with a new fire alarm system and fire rate doors as per the Department of Building and Zoning’s suggestion.\n \n2. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.  The amt of additional funds to be expended under the modification:  $396,386.19  \n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $1,268,300.00 (PO449206)\nModification No. 1 (current):                     $   396,386.19\nTotal (Original and Mod 1):                     $1,664,686.19\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nThe Department of Building and Zoning recommended a new fire alarm system and fire rate doors for additional safety.\n \nC. Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\nThe current contractor is familiar with the project and has completed all work to-date.  Bringing on a new contractor would further delay the project and result in higher costs bringing them up to speed.\n \nD.  How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nThe contractor submitted a cost proposal and was accepted by the Office of Construction Management.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: DAX No. 6059, expires 12/28/25, Majority-designated\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Elford, Inc.\n \n4.  FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  Future modifications are not expected at this time.  \n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is being requested in order to have the materials ordered and installed by November 2025 in order to meet the requirements of the CDBG grant.  \n \n6.
