    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with VS Engineering, Inc. for the Hard Surface Program 2025-2026 Project. The contract amount is $167,954.82, with a contingency of $7,045.18, for a total of $175,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nEach year, the Recreation and Parks Department allocates a portion of the Capital Improvement Budget (CIB) to improve existing hard surfaces and accessibility. The hard surfaces program focuses on the removal and replacement of existing asphalt and concrete surfaces that are highly used by the public. These include entry drives, parking lots, park drives, sport courts, walkways, and trails. These improvements ensure safe and easy access to the parks and facilities. Areas for improvement are determined by requests from internal staff and the public. All requests are assessed and given a Pavement Condition Rating (PCR), indicating a rank from 0, meaning the worst condition, to 100, meaning the best condition. Requests are then prioritized for action based on their respective PCR scores and feedback from relevant stakeholders.\n \nIn March 2025, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department issued a competitive request for proposals, using three prequalified architectural firms. In April 2025, VS Engineering, Inc. was selected to provide professional services for this round of the annual hard surface program. This contract will provide engineering services to assess existing hard surface conditions, design improvements, and create complete construction documents for bidding in winter 2025. The anticipated project schedule will have construction starting in spring 2026.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions: Proposals were advertised to firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on March 3, 2025 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 18, 2025. Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nVS Engineering, Inc. \nGPD Group \nEvans, Mechwart, Hambleton, & Tilton, Inc. DBA EMH&T \n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor were they part of this evaluation.\n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended VS Engineering, Inc. be selected to perform the work. The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nVS Engineering, Inc.\n4275 North High School Road \nIndianapolis, Indiana 46254                                                    \nAmeetrice T. Smalls, (317) 293-3542\nContract Compliance Number: 031373\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 7, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to help ensure hard surface improvements are completed prior to spring 2026 in order to address public safety concerns, minimize impacts to programming, and to fulfill community commitments. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will provide high quality asphalt, concrete, and sport court surfaces throughout Recreation and Parks’ properties, ensuring a more consistent level of service across the City. These improvements increase accessibility, enjoyment of the parks, and health for residents.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Hard surface improvements are gathered via 311 requests, area commission meetings, and field staff observations.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by removing access and circulation barriers in city parks. \n \nFiscal Impact: $55,902.25 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of a portion of this expenditure. The remaining funds, in the amount of $119,097.75, will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed. There is a total of $175,000.00 available for this project. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with VS Engineering, Inc. for the Hard Surface Improvements 2025-2026 Project; to authorize the transfer of $119,097.75 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $119,097.75 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $7,612.25 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the transfer of $55,902.25 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $175,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
