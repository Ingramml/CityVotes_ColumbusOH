    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance establishes funding for the Department of Public Safety to acquire and deploy an early warning system.\n \nAn early warning system (EWS) is a benchmarking tool that can be utilized to identify patterns in the behavior of police officers. For those officers demonstrating a pattern of problematic behavior, an EWS can provide for the ability to intervene and correct unprofessional behavior before it escalates to misconduct or any other undesirable outcome. At the same time, a benchmarking tool can also be used to reinforce positive conduct, to support officers, and to foster a stronger sense of community within the police ranks.\n \nIn consideration of recent events, the Division of Police has initiated an evaluation of potential early warning system products, and a recommendation on a selected product is shortly anticipated. In order to avoid any delay in the contracting, acquisition, and deployment process, this funding is being made available now, prior to passage of the 2021 operating budget. \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in the acquisition and deployment of a Police early warning system.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an appropriation within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund for the purpose of acquiring and deploying a Police early warning system; and to declare an emergency.
