($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to accept a one year no cost extension from the Ohio Department of Public Safety, Ohio Traffic Safety Office, for the Drive to Succeed Grant Program extending the project period from June 30, 2025 to June 30, 2026, and to modify two existing contracts for driver education services with Schwartz Driving Schools and Driving School of Ohio.\n \nThe contract with Schwartz Driving Schools, entered into on March 15, 2023, will have its term extended from an original end date of June 30, 2025 to a new end date of June 30, 2026. The contract compliance number is CC048304 and the underlying contract was solicited and awarded via Vendor Services RFQ according to City Code. All other contract terms will remain in effect. \n \nThe contract with Driving School of Ohio, entered into on March 20, 2023, will have its term extended from an original end date of June 30, 2025 to a new end date of June 30, 2026. The contract compliance number is CC048302 and the underlying contract was solicited and awarded via Vendor Services RFQ according to City Code. All other contract terms will remain in effect. \n \nIn addition, this no-cost extension and the modification of existing contracts are necessary to allow sufficient time to complete program implementation and fully utilize available grant resources. The extension will enable Columbus Public Health and its driving school partners to serve additional program participants, finalize data reporting, and continue providing critical driver education services to eligible youth. The additional time will help ensure program outcomes are met and that the intended public safety impacts of the Drive to Succeed Grant are fully realized, particularly for underserved populations.\n \nEmergency action is requested to implement the no cost extension prior to the end of the original grant period and contract terms. Columbus Public Health was not able to request authorization sooner as the no-cost extension was not awarded until March 30, 2025.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No new expenditures will be obligated by this ordinance. ($0.00)\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to accept a one-year no-cost extension from the Ohio Department of Public Safety, Ohio Traffic Safety Office, for the Drive to Succeed Grant Program; to modify existing contracts with Schwartz Driving Schools and Driving School of Ohio; and to declare an emergency.
