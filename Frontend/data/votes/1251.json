    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women’s Improving Criminal Justice Reponses (ICJR) program funds via a sub-award from Franklin County Board of Commissioners’ Office of Justice Policy and Programs. ICJR funds support a county-wide, intra-agency effort to improve justice responses to domestic violence crimes. \n \nAward funds support the implementation of the evidence-based Blueprint for Safety: An Inter-agency Response to Domestic Violence model in Columbus and Franklin County. Blueprint for Safety applies a collective impact approach to domestic violence. It build off local successes by linking best practice communication protocols, risk assessments and evidence collection tactics occurring at each justice phase. Through the Blueprint process, justice and victim advocacy practitioners work collaboratively to review and update current response protocols/practices and develop standard methods for proactive data sharing. The result is a single, written DV response policy with clear protocols outlining each practitioner’s role, responsibilities, specific actions, and documentation duties. Successful implementation of protocols is supported through ongoing training, reference resources and active communication between and across practitioners.  \n \nBlueprint for Safety is grounded in the experiences of victims of violence and an understanding of how the intervention of the criminal justice system affects their lives.  This victim-centered approach supports authorities’ ability to intervene quickly when there are new acts of violence, intimidation or coercion; and shifts the burden of holding the offender accountable for violence or abuse from the victim to the system. Outcomes of the Blueprint for Safety include:\n \n§                     Keeping more women and children in their own home\n§                     Increased victim safety and perpetrator accountability\n§                     Reduced domestic abuse-related homicides\n§                     Reduced level of domestic abuse incidents.  For example, St. Paul experienced a reduction of domestic abuse emergency calls from 11,000 to 5,000 between 2009 and 2016\n \nGrant funding awarded to the City of Columbus will support hiring a project director to serve as the ICJR Blueprint for Safety grant manger.\nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation of grant funds ($193,748) to the grant project fund.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure grant dollars are immediately available to initiate swift action on grant objectives and activities.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $193,748 in U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women’s Improving Criminal Justice Reponses (ICJR) program funds.
