    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to accept and appropriate $137,250.00 in grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health, with some of the funding originating from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the FY26 Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Grant, for the period of July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026.  \n \nThe Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Program will increase the readiness of our community to initiate and engage in tobacco control and cessation strategies with an anticipated outcome of creating social norm change to decrease initiation and use of tobacco in local communities (including the initiation of the use of e-cigarettes/vaping products), to increase quitting of tobacco, to decrease the community’s exposure to secondhand smoke, and to decrease disparities in tobacco burden usually associated with health inequities.\n \nColumbus Public Health has not received the official NOA for this grant, which is scheduled to start on July 1, 2025; therefore, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to not delay these critical services and to ensure funds are available by the grant start date.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is fully funded by the Ohio Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and does not generate revenue or require a City match ($137,250.00).   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, plus any additional funds for the FY26 Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Grant Program; to authorize the appropriation of funds, including any additional funds, from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the FY26 Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Grant Program, and to declare an emergency.
