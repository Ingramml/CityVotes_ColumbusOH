    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to amend an agreement with Flock Group Inc. to add the ForceMetrics Informed Responder Platform to the existing camera leasing services agreement for a free one-year, non-renewable, trial period; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  ForceMetrics is a powerful tool for law enforcement that delivers critical information to first responders and co-responders, empowering them to make better, more informed decisions in real-time. The high-speed search, insights, and analytics platform streamlines the process of navigating large amounts of data across disparate systems such as CAD and RMS. By providing faster access to critical information, ForceMetrics helps responders more efficiently and effectively serve their communities while addressing social issues such as homelessness, domestic violence, gun violence, and mental health challenges. Not only does this save lives, but also reduces cost and risk for government agencies, while avoiding undue injury to both community members and responders. Built with security top of mind, ForceMetrics is CJIS compliant and SOC 2 certified. Key functions of the platform include data integration, retrieval, management, sharing, and analysis and reporting. \n \nA camera leasing services contract between the City of Columbus and Flock Group Inc. was initially authorized by Ordinance No. 3181-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on December 9, 2024. The Department of Public Safety now seeks to amend this agreement to include the ForceMetrics Informed Responder platform as an additional software solution. This amendment provides for a one-year, non-renewable trial period at no cost to the City. The trial will begin upon approval of this amendment by Columbus City Council. At the conclusion of the trial period, the City may choose to continue use of the platform under the terms outlined in an approved Scope of Services by entering into a direct agreement with ForceMetrics.\n \nAs part of this amendment, the City will receive access to the ForceMetrics platform for up to 500 users at no cost. The platform will be integrated with the City’s existing systems, and all integration services, including any related third-party costs, will be covered by ForceMetrics. \n \nIn addition to the integrations, the ForceMetrics trial includes:\n•                     Full project implementation\n•                     On-site user onboarding and training\n•                     Technical support and service level agreements per ForceMetrics’ standard terms\n•                     Ongoing software updates and platform enhancements\n•                     A dedicated Customer Success Manager and regular training opportunities\n \nImportantly, the City retains complete ownership of all data from its sources. ForceMetrics is prohibited from sharing any City data with third parties without express permission.\n \nKey features of the ForceMetrics platform include:\n•                     Federated search across integrated data systems using plain language\n•                     Automated labels classifying calls and events by topic or risk\n•                     Map-based visualization of search results\n•                     Automated police report summarization\n•                     Internal sharing of Entity Pages\n•                     Analytical dashboards for trend and pattern analysis\n•                     Saved and customizable searches and dashboards\n•                     A CompStat dashboard with crime analysis tools\n•                     Optional regional data sharing with data control maintained by the City\n•                     Web-based mobile access from any device\n•                     A centralized alerts and notifications center\n•                     Single Sign-On (SAML 2.0) for streamlined authentication\n \nShould the City choose to continue the service beyond the free trial, pricing options include:\n•                     Year Two: $209,999\n•                     Year Three: $220,499\n•                     Additional user blocks (100 users): $54,000 per block\n        •                     Full agency deployment: $857,412\nFiscal Impact: There will be no fiscal impact for the 2025 budget cycle; there will be a need for funds in 2026 if the Department/Division continues with the Platform after the trial period.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested in order to ensure the timely amendment of the existing agreement with Flock Group Inc., allowing for immediate implementation of the ForceMetrics Informed Responder platform to enhance the Department of Public Safety’s operational capabilities without delay. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to amend an agreement with Flock Group Inc. to add the ForceMetrics Informed Responder Platform to the existing camera leasing services agreement for a free one-year, non-renewable, trial period; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety has a need to add an additional software solution to the existing camera leasing services agreement with Flock Group Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Public Safety seeks authorization from City Council to amend the existing agreement with Flock Group Inc. to incorporate the ForceMetrics Informed Responder platform as an additional software component, providing a one-year, non-renewable trial period at no cost to the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize this amendment in order to ensure timely implementation of the ForceMetrics Informed Responder platform, which will enhance situational awareness and public safety operations; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to amend an agreement with Flock Group Inc. to incorporate the ForceMetrics Informed Responder platform as an additional software component, providing a one-year, non-renewable trial period at no cost to the City of Columbus.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
