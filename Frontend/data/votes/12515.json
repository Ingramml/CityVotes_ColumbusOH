    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance to enter into contract with Fisher Scientific Company LLC for the purchase of a Handheld Gemini Raman/FTIR as part of the State Homeland Security Grant. This Gemini will replace the First Defender and True defender units which are unserviceable and not economically repairable. The Gemini allows for FTIR and Raman to both be used from the same device to identify unknown solid and liquid chemicals. This device is used to detect products used for the production of explosives, chemical agents and many others. Using this unit will give the team, operating at a potential terrorism incident, the ability to gain information regarding the identification of unknown products and build a plan to move forward with the mitigation and recovery stage of potential terrorist incidents. This asset would be assigned to Hazmat Support Unit 4. This is the primary response vehicle that takes all calls for service, placing this asset on any incident scene in the State of Ohio where the Columbus Fire Hazmat team's presence is requested. \n \nBID INFORMATION: Three proposals were received on RFQ029885 by the bid closing date of April 10, 2025, and the lowest overall bidder did not meet specifications, therefore the second low bidder was selected.  Approval was sought from the Ohio EMA to proceed with the procurement of the Gemini using the FY23 State Homeland Security Grant (G342402) and approval was given on May 13, 2025.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested so that the Division of Fire may purchase the Gemini Raman/FTIR prior to expiration of the bids and to meet grant deadlines. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $130,122.34 from the FY23 State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) Grant (G342402) for the purchase of a Gemini Raman/FTIR.  Funds were budgeted in the FY23 State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) Grant for this purpose and have been appropriated and authorized by Ordinance 2803-2024. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance, on behalf of the Public Safety, Division of Fire, to enter into contract with Fisher Scientific Company LLC for the purchase of a Handheld Gemini Raman/FTIR; to authorize an expenditure of $130,122.34 from the FY23 State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) Grant; and to declare an emergency.
