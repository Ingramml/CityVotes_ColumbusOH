    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify to increase a service contract with Sensus USA, Inc. for the Enhanced Meter Project. This is a joint project between the Division of Water (DOW) and the Division of Power (DOP). \n \nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities with the supply and installation of power meters, the installation of city issued water meters, the supply and installation of all communications infrastructure and all software required to operate an Enhanced Meter System to interface with the City of Columbus systems and applications. The DOW and the DOP will be funding this project through various funding sources. The solution will allow both DOW and DOP to collect meter readings and provide enhanced services for DOW’s approximately 300,000 customers/accounts and DOP’s approximately 16,000 customers/accounts.\n \nThe original ordinance (1024-2020) authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a long-term Spectrum Lease Agreement in order to operate Sensus's FlexNet equipment. The Spectrum that Sensus is leasing is authorized by Sensus’s FCC License(s) and is limited to the service area where the FlexNet equipment will be operated. The frequencies of the FCC License within the City’s geographic Service Area are called the “Leased Spectrum” and the City will pay fees to Sensus for the use of the Leased Spectrum.\n \nThe first modification ordinance (0223-2021) increased the funding by $2,303,586.03 as was planned in the original proposal. The funds were for the purchase and installation of electricity meters, related components and other required services. The second modification (2436-2022) increased the funding by $500,000.00 to account for customer growth causing an increase in demand for meters. The third modification (1802-2024) increased the funding by $500,000.00 for addtional customer growth.\n \nThis modification of $600,000.00 will allow for additional customer growth and to replenish project meter inventory to ensure every non-AMI meter is replaced with a AMI meter. \n \nPlanning area:  \"99 - Citywide\" (Entire service area including suburbs)\n \nThe Water Portion of this project has been approved for below market rate loan financing through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) which is administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA). Loan No. 8884 was awarded April 30, 2020. Federal Davis Bacon Wage Rates and Requirements apply.\n \nTHE PROJECT TIMELINE: The original term of this Contract was for 1,500 calendar days after the date of the Notice to Proceed in accordance with the approved schedule included in the Statement of Work. The contract is expected to be completed in less than 5 years, however, this may change in the future if a change order is presented and approved by the Division of Water.\n \nBID INFORMATION:  The selection of the firm providing the services was performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Columbus City Code, Section 329.28. The evaluation criteria included: 1. Understanding of Project, 2. Environmental Considerations, 3. Past Performance, 4. Local Workforce, in addition to 5. Warranty and 6.

The Department of Public Utilities awarded the contract to Sensus USA, Inc. Based on the nature of the services to be provided, the use of various funding sources and the timeline for the implementation of various phases of the project, two contracts were executed. One contract provides for the initial supply and installation of meters and the communications infrastructure. The second contract provides for the software, operation support and maintenance necessary for the ongoing operation of the Enhanced Meter System and was authorized under separate legislation. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities requested and received a waiver of the provisions of Chapter 329 related to procurement to authorize the execution of both contracts pursuant to the RFP process described above.\n \nSUPPLIER: Sensus USA, Inc., vendor #008960, exp. 2/2/26, MAJ\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Sensus USA, Inc.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds:  The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #3 is $600,000.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $80,249,337.89.\n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  This contract modification is needed to fulfill the funding requirements for the project by the Division of Power. This modification was anticipated and explained in the original contract language when it was signed    between the City and Sensus USA, Inc.  The funding will be used for the installation of electricity meters, related components and other required services to complete the contract.\n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract.\n \n4.   How was cost determined:  The cost, terms and conditions of the renewal are in accordance with the original agreement.\n \nECONOMIC/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  The Enhanced Meter Project will replace outdated and under-performing meters, install radio transmitting infrastructure to allow wireless readings relayed to the billing software at a central location and provide an environmentally efficient way to read meters. The project will greatly enhance customer service capabilities, make improvements to operational efficiency and provide increased revenue protection. There is extensive community outreach included in the contract. The project is also expected to have a positive environmental impact by reducing the number of vehicles on the road. \n \nCost summary:\n \nOriginal Contract:\nDOW                                                                                                                              $73,846,819.86 (Loan)\nDOP                                                                                                                                                 $1,500,000.00 (Operating Cash)\n2020 CONTRACT TOTAL                                                               $75,346,819.86\n \nLoan Origination Fees                                                                                    $996,932.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                                                                                    $2,000.00\nGrand Total of Legislation                                                                                    $76,345,751.86\n \nDOP 2021 Contract Modification:                                          $2,303,586.03 (Operating Cash)\nDOP 2022 Contract Modification:                                           $500,000.00 (Operating Cash)\nDOP 2024 Contract Modification:                                           $500,000.00 (Operating Cash)\n \nTotal of Modified Legislation                                                               $79,649,337.89\n \nThis Contract Modification:                                                               $600,000.00 (Operating Cash)\nTotal Contract (Original + Mods):                                                               $80,249,337.89\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $600,000.00 is budgeted in the Electricity Operating Fund and needed for this purchase. \n \n$1,862,966.26 was spent from the Electricity Operating Fund in 2024\n$271,671.96 was spent from the Electricity Operating Fund in 2023\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify to increase funding to a service contract with Sensus USA, Inc. for the Enhanced Meter Project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $600,000.00 from the Electricity Operating Fund.
