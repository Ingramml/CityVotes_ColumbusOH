    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement (Modification No. 2) with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $15,000.00 to assist individuals served by the Columbus Violence Reduction (CVR) program with funding for temporary accommodations.  As it was authorized with the original agreement, this grant modification will include advancement of funds per a pre-determined schedule.\n \nOriginal                                       $   65,000.00                            Ord. 1686-2023                      PO467735\nMod 1                                                           $ 150,000.00                                           Ord. 3360-2024                                          PO485707Mod 2                                                                                    $   15,000.00\nTotal                                            $ 230,000.00         \n \nThe Tony R Wells Foundation will partner with a City-selected partner operating as the Vacated Tenant Services (VTS) Temporary Housing Coordinator for eligible vacated tenants. The Tony R Wells Foundation will act as the Temporary Housing Coordinator’s fiscal manager to dispense funding to enable temporary accommodations. Assistance may include temporary housing costs and essential relocation assistance expenses. \n \nThe VTS partners make program eligibility determinations to qualify residents for funding to ensure housing stability and the Temporary Housing Coordinator will, in turn, inform the Tony R Wells Foundation which temporary accommodations are approved for funding and how much.  \n \nThe Columbus Violence Reduction (CVR) program will coordinate with the VTS program to provide emergency temporary housing units for CVR participants when there is a time sensitive situation that requires individuals or households to be relocated for public safety related concerns.\n \nFunding for this program focuses on assisting displaced tenants from unsafe, unsanitary or inhabitable housing conditions.  The Tony R Wells Foundation will make the payments directly to the recipients or other entities on their behalf.  As such, funds will be advanced to the Tony R Wells Foundation.  \n \nUnder this agreement, funding is included for recipients’ needs and a 6% fee for the Tony R Wells Foundation acting as the fiscal manager.  \n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of the additional funds to be expended is $15,000.00.\n2.                     The Department of Development could not predict the rate at which the Vacated Tenant Services program would build capacity to include additional City agencies.\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to continue with the Tony R Wells Foundation’s current contract as they are the acting fiscal manager partnered with the VTS Temporary Housing Coordinator. \n4.                     The amount of this modification is based on the availability of funds and not a pricing strategy.\n \nEmergency action is requested to prevent disruption of services as the Columbus Violence Reduction program is actively working to place households, often removing them from violent situations.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided by a transfer from the Office of Violence Prevention’s 2025 budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s number is 038668 and expires on 06/22/2025.  Updated contract compliance is pending.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $15,000.00 to provide assistance to individuals facing housing instability; to authorize the transfer and expenditure of up to $15,000.00 from the General Fund; to authorize advance payments per a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
