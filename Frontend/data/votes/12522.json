    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the transfer between object classes in an amount up to $3,600.00 and expenditure in an amount up to $124,272.25 within the Healthy Homes Production Grant (G442200); requests that Columbus City Council waive the provisions in Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14, 329.18, and 329.09 pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15; and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to approve purchase orders with contractors for the Healthy Homes Program that may be greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement with a homeowner or purchase order with a contractor to carry out the purpose of the grant program, all without having to return to City Council for each project for the Healthy Homes Program.\n \nThe Department of Development received the Healthy Homes Production Grant (HHPG Grant) from the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 2022 and this grant provides funding for the Lead Safe Columbus Program.  The grant was authorized via ordinance 1115-2022 as a reimbursable grant in an amount up to $2,000,000.00.  \n \nThe funds to be expended under this legislation are funds that have been previously transferred within the grant or cancelled from grant agreements/purchase orders from projects already completed under the Healthy Homes Production Grant.  Since appropriation has been received under Ordinance 1115-2022, only approval to expend these cancelled funds is needed.  That any future cancellation of funds from grant agreements/purchase orders can be re-established by the City Auditor to allow for a more expedient process of entering into grant agreements with homeowners without having to go back to City Council\n \nIn order to effectively and efficiently manage these remaining funds, the grant, the Healthy Homes Grant Program, and to expend the funds before the grant ends October 18, 2025, this legislation requests the waiver of the provisions in Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14, 329.18, and 329.09, pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15, and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to approve purchase orders with contractors that may be greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement with a homeowner and purchase order with a contractor to carry out the purpose of the Healthy Homes Grant Program without having to return to City Council for each project.\n \nColumbus City Codes (CCC) Section 111.14 states, that “All programs which award loans or grants of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) must submit legislation for approval to city council”;  CCC 329.18 states, “No contract greater than $50,000.00 awarded under this section shall be effective until approved by ordinance of city council”; and CCC 329.09 states, “After agreeing upon the terms of a modification, the city agency shall submit legislation to city council requesting approval of the modification….”  Under this ordinance, these provisions would be waived.  \n \nThe funds will allow the Healthy Homes Program to continue to provide property owners with grants for lead safe, healthier, affordable housing for families with low and moderate income under HUD guidelines. The program provides healthy homes activities in accordance with HUD guidelines, takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries within the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion rather than addressing a single hazard at a time.  Safety hazards such as mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, pests, carbon monoxide, injury and safety hazards in addition to lead-based paint are some of the items addressed within this grant funding. \n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the immediate approval to assure that the program has funding available as there are citizens waiting on the approval of funds to remediate the health and safety hazards within their homes and immediate approval is needed to assure so the funds can be expended before the expiration of the grant, October 18, 2025, as a delay may result in funds being returned to HUD and fewer homes served.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the HHPG Grant G442200.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer between object classes in an amount up to $3,600.00 and the expenditure in an amount up to $124,272.25 within the Healthy Homes Production Grant; to waive the provisions in Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14, 329.18, and 329.09 pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development, for the Healthy Homes Production Grant, to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to approve purchase orders with contractors that may be greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement with a homeowner or purchase order with a contractor to carry out the purpose of the grant program, to authorize the City Auditor to re-establish funds that have been canceled from grant agreements/purchase orders, all without having to return to City Council for each project for the Healthy Homes Production Grant Program; and to declare an emergency.
