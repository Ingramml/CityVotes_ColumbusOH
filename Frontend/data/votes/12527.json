    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department modify an existing contract with Pavement Protectors, Inc. DBA M&D Blacktop to provide construction services associated with the Hard Surfaces Program 2024 - Phase 2 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $854,402.25, with a contingency of $29,000.00, for a total of $883,402.25. An additional $1,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $884,402.25 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Hard Surfaces Program is an annual program to improve concrete and asphalt surfaces. This project modification addresses additional improvements needed at four parking lots and connecting drives at the Anheuser-Busch Sports Park Complex. This resurfacing work needs to align with existing construction contracts bringing pickleball courts, lighting, and turf infields to the sports complex. This resurfacing and related efforts need ample time to not cause disruptions to scheduled programming. All of these improvements will elevate the sports complex facilities that allow for national level events such as the North American Gay Amateur Athletic Association’s Gay Softball World Series.\n \nAdditionally, the Sustainable Columbus Team at the Department of Public Utilities has allocated $50,000.00 in their operating budget to support a “cool surfaces” project that will install solar reflective color coating at Blackburn Park. In collaboration with Sustainable Columbus and City Council, the additional color coating at Blackburn Park is being included with this modification to reduce project costs. This product is piloted for future funding allocations for \"Smart Surfaces\" with the goal of reducing overall ambient temperatures within Columbus Recreation and Parks properties based on Sustainable Columbus' 2022 Urban Heat Island Study.\n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $884,402.25\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: An opportunity presented itself for Columbus to be the host city for the 2026 North American Gay Amateur Athletic Association's Gay Softball World Series, which is the largest annual week-long, LGBTQ+ single-sport, athletic competition in the world. This event would bring participants from fifty-four cities across North America to the Anheuser-Busch Sports Complex. Securing this high profile event for Columbus requires park improvements be made prior to the start of the 2026 softball season.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: The additional resurfacing work needs to align with existing construction contracts to bring pickleball courts, lighting, and turf infields to the sports complex. This resurfacing and related efforts need ample time to not cause disruptions to scheduled programming.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: Unit prices from the existing contract were used to determine the price for work at Anheuser-Busch Sports Complex. An allocation of $50,000 from Sustainable Columbus is being used for the reflective color coating work at Blackburn Park.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nPavement Protectors DBA M&D Blacktop\n2020 Longwood Avenue\nGrove City, Ohio 43123\nMark Nance, (614) 875-9989\nContract Compliance Number: 004731\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 24, 2027\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure hard surface improvements are completed prior to the 2026 sports season to fulfill community commitments and to minimize impacts to programming.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This modification will provide accessible and usable asphalt improvements for Anheuser-Busch Sports Park and Blackburn Park. These efforts will improve the level of service at these locations for residents and visitors. Over 4,400 residents live within a 10-minute walk and thousands more residents live within a 10-minute drive of Blackburn Park. The Anheuser-Busch Sports Complex has 1,977 residents within a 10-minute walk. This location also hosts local and national organizations’ sporting events annually.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: These improvements are based off community requests for improvements through word of mouth, 311 submissions, and staff recommendations.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Northwest (34), Near East (56)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by removing access barriers to city parks and by updating at least five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,392,661.25 was legislated for the Hard Surface Program 2024 - Phase by Ordinance 2481-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $884,402.25. $884,402.25 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 and Public Utilities Electricity Operating Fund 6300 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $2,277,063.50. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Pavement Protectors DBA M&D Blacktop for the Hard Surface Program 2024 - Phase 2 Project; to authorize the transfer of $834,402.25 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $834,402.25 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $884,402.25 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund and Public Utilities Electricity Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
