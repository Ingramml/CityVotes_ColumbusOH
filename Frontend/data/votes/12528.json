    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the existing contract with CK Construction Group for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $5,004,500.00. \n \nKilbourne Run Sports Park, located at 4625 Westerville Road, is a soccer specific facility that stretches over 62 acres with 35 of those acres dedicated to athletic space. This is a Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) Contract. This delivery method will save the project money and time compared to a traditional Design-Bid-Build delivery. This is one of a few planned modifications for the project's guaranteed maximum price. This modification will cover costs for Phase 2 construction which includes a traffic roundabout, park frontage, and signage.\n \nThis modification was foreseen due to the nature of the CMR contract. The total contract value with this modification is $35,730,125.00. The modification fee was determined by the Construction Manager at Risk's subcontractor's cost estimates for the proposed work. No other vendor could perform this work since it is part of the scope for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park CMR contract. The original project completion date of the project was January 1, 2025. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will be May 1, 2026.  \n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $5,004,500.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: This modification was foreseen due to the nature of CMR contracts. This modification covers scope for Phase 2 construction of the Project, which are the last components of the project to be built. This includes roundabout construction, park frontage construction, and signage installation. \n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: All of the scope associated with this vendor's contract modification is associated with the original project scope. The project was broken into phase and contract modifications to align with the CMR project delivery method.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The price for additional services was determined by the vendor providing anticipated construction costs by their construction team. CK Construction Group's construction team is part self-performing CK Construction Group trade groups and part subcontractors. All of the construction team has been selected by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department based on quality of vendor, competitive pricing, etc.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCK Construction Group\n6245 Westerville Road\nWesterville, Ohio 43081\nJames Negron, (614) 901-8844\nContract Compliance Number: 006875 \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: August 23, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to start construction in July 2025, meet the revised construction completion date in May 2026, and meet commitments that have been made to residents in opening the new facilities for programming.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the soccer amenities and outdoor sports programs the City can offer to the public. Additionally, this modification will improve the roadway and right of way, creating safer access into the park for motorists and pedestrians.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Input for this project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports, and Leisure International (CSL) and managed by the Recreation and Parks Department in the summer of 2021. An open house for the project was conducted in the fall of 2023. Input was also received by internal Recreation and Parks stakeholders and the Mayor’s Office. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northland (35)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to update sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $30,725,625.00 was legislated for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project by Ordinances 1801-2023, 3061-2023, and 1374-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $5,004,500.00. $5,004,500.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702, Morse Road TIF Fund 7414, and Northland TIF Fund 7423 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $35,730,125.00. A portion of the funds, in the amount of $1,004,500.00 will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with CK Construction Group, Inc. for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $1,004,500.00 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $1,004,500.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the collective transfer of $4,000,000.00 within the Morse Road TIF Fund and Northland TIF Fund; to authorize the collective appropriation of $4,000,000.00 within the Morse Road TIF Fund and Northland TIF Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $5,004,500.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, Morse Road TIF Fund, and Northland TIF Fund; and to declare an emergency.
