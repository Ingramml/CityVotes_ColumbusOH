    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with CBCT Building Futures to provide pre-apprenticeship training to a cohort of 15 Columbus residents.\n \nThe City of Columbus seeks to create a pre-apprenticeship program through a collaboration between CBCT and the City of Refuge Goodlife Foundation. CBCT will administer the program, bringing their expertise with the Building Futures program to a partnership City of Refuge Goodlife Foundation, which can leverage its deep relationships and trust in the community to recruit participants and provide strong emotional and tangible support to participants as they overcome barriers to work.\n \nThis program will be a 12-week program that will provide 15 City of Columbus residents with the skills needed to begin a career in the region booming construction industry, in a partnership between The City of Refuge Goodlife Foundation and CBCT-Building Futures. A career with one of the affiliated trades will provide participants with a gainful starting wage, health benefits, and retirement benefits. After the successful conclusion of the 12-week program, participants will have a pathway into a registered apprenticeship program.\n \nThe not-for-profit service contract will support personnel costs, participant screening and entry costs, some direct support to participants, curriculum, and other miscellaneous supplies and services for the program. Up to $3,000.00 may be used to support the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants in the cohort.\n \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the city’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested in order to launch on schedule, with an expected start date in August. In order to authorize the contract and issue funds in support of the program ahead of the cohort launch date, emergency action is required.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with CBCT Building Futures in an amount not to exceed $200,000.00 to create a pre-apprenticeship training program; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($200,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus seeks to establish a pre-apprenticeship training program for 15 Columbus residents who seek to pursue a career in the trades; and\n \nWHEREAS, CBCT Building Futures brings experience with their Building Futures pre-apprenticeship program in providing this training; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Refuge Goodlife Foundation has a unique connection to the community and the ability to recruit and support participants, helping them overcome barriers to work; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with CBCT Building Futures in order to provide funds and launch the program in a timely manner, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
