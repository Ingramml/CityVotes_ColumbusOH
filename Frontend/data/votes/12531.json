    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an agreement with Bell Textron Inc. for the purchase of two aircraft and related supplies and services in the quantities and at the agreed unit and total prices, as set forth in Appendix 1 and any Amendment(s) thereto to this Agreement. The Columbus Division of Police Aviation Section, Helicopter Unit, has proudly served the citizens of Columbus since 1972.  The police helicopter has proven to be a dynamic force multiplier in the detection and apprehension of criminals. \n \nThe City of Columbus has not purchased an all-new helicopter placed into service since 2012. The purchase and delivery of a new helicopter was completed in 2020, but the helicopter was later sold at a profit due to numerous factors. The current fleet of four (4) MD530F helicopters have a combined total of 39,136 hours of operation and are aging, as the oldest was purchased in 2006. The technology in the aircraft is older as well and has not been updated since 2019. \n \nIn order to provide the safest equipment possible, the Columbus Division of Police Aviation Section must replace older, outdated equipment. Prior experience with Bell helicopters as well as prior committee work and selection were considered while selecting Bell Helicopters as a vendor for this purchase, including pricing and value (both current and residual), performance, mission, payload/capability, maintenance and direct operating cost (DOC).  Both manufactured products would meet or exceed CPD’s goals and expectations. The Bell 505 Jet Ranger X is less expensive than the MD530F. Bell 505 - $1.735M (base price) verses MD 530F - $3.8M (base price). Bell 505 consumes less fuel per hour, allowing for greater fuel endurance than the MD530F, has fewer life limited parts reducing scheduled maintenance requirements, and will allow higher patrol flight altitudes, which is safer for the aircrews and more neighborly by reducing noise pollution (this will be dependent on user agreement with CMH and weather conditions).\n \nThe helicopters are estimated to be delivered in December 2025.  Upon receipt by the City, it is the intention of the Division of Police to sell an MD530F to maintain its complement of five helicopters.\n \nBid Information - This purchase is recommended to be made with a waiver of formal bidding requirements, because of prior experience with Bell helicopters and based on prior committee work and selection. \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested because of the need to get this agreement implemented as soon as possible (due to the long manufacturing lead time) and maintain the capabilities of Division of Police Helicopters.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $5,940,233.00 to enter into an agreement with Bell Textron Inc. for the purchase of two Bell 505 Basic Aircrafts. Funds are available to certify in the General Fund, Income Tax Set-Aside Subfund for this purpose. Bonds will be issued to reimburse the Income Tax Set-Aside Subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into an agreement with Bell Textron Inc. for the purchase of two Bell 505 Basic Aircraft for the Division of Police; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize an amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation of $5,940,233.00 from the General Fund, Income Tax Set-Aside Subfund; to authorize the transfer of $5,940,233.00 between funds; to authorize the expenditure of $5,940,233.00 from the Public Safety Taxable Debt Fund; and to declare an emergency.
