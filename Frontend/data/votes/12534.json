    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract with Synagro Central, LLC, through the City’s Invitation For Bid process, for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 in an amount up to $4,372,128.84.  \n \nWater residuals are the byproduct of treating raw water to create safe drinking water.  Residuals are created when chemicals react with suspended solids in the raw water.  Under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) of the Clean Water Act, the entity that creates the residuals is responsible for safely and responsibly storing and disposing them.  At the Hap Cremean Water Plant, these residuals are stored in lagoons until disposal is needed.  Periodically, approximately every four to six years, Lagoon 1 nears its residual storage capacity and must be emptied both to continue as a residuals storage facility and to prevent a discharge of these materials back into the environment.  \n \nThe purpose of the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 project is to provide services to remove, transport, and dispose of the water treatment residuals and grit-laden material from Lagoon 1.  Some of these materials will be disposed of in a beneficial reuse manner as liming material or agronomic benefit for land application, while some of the materials will be taken to McKinley Avenue Quarry for disposal.  This disposal preserves the existing lagoon to continue to be used for residual storage.  The cost of emptying Lagoon 1 of residuals is much less than it would cost to buy new land and build another residuals storage lagoon.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE\nAll work shall be substantially complete within 150 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed, with the Final Completion to occur within 180 calendar days.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed in third quarter 2025.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT\nThe bid amount and proposed award amount is $4,372,128.84, including a 20% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                               $     4,372,128.84                                          \nFuture Anticipated Needs                                               $                 0.00\n      CONTRACT TOTAL                                               $     4,372,128.84                                          \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe removal of residuals from Lagoon 1 will provide additional storage for residuals generated by the Hap Cremean Water Plant. This added capacity helps reduce the City’s risk of an NPDES violation caused from discharges from the lagoons containing residuals, and is considerably less expensive than buying land and building a new storage lagoon.  There are no anticipated public meetings during this project. The Division of Water will be responsible for coordinating with stakeholders. \n \n3.  SERVICES CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from April 30, 2025, through May 15, 2025.  One bid was received for the project and opened on May 15, 2025.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                     Bid Amount                        City/State                    \nSynagro Central, LLC                     $4,372,128.84                   Baltimore, MD                       \n \nThe Synagro Central, LLC 's bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $4,372,128.84.\n \nThe certification of Synagro Central, LLC was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nSynagro Central, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC010213 and expires 5/23/26.   \n \nAs part of their proposal, Synagro Central, LLC, has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                \nAgrihauling                                                                                       Unknown/Not on System                                          \nALCS                                                                Noblesville, Indiana                                       \nLengacher Farms, LLC                            Smithville, Ohio                                             \n \nThe certification of Synagro Central, LLC, was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\nAgrihauling will need to register on Vendor Services.  ALCS and Lengacher Farms, LLC will both need to update their accounts on Vendor Services.\n \n5.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nThis is a service contract and not subject to pre-qualification requirements.  \n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis contract is funded through the Water Operating Fund, Fund 6000.  \n \n7.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.  The emergency designation is to address the urgent need to remove residuals from a full lagoon at HCWP. Residuals accumulated within the lagoon more rapidly than projected due to a flow capacity reduction in the residuals conveyance force main. Cleaning the lagoon is critical to maintain the full operational capacity of HCWP.  If the lagoon exceeds capacity we will be in violation of our National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) operating permit and could be subjected to penalties.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a services contract with Synagro Central, LLC for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 project; to authorize the expenditure of $4,372,128.84 from the Water Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($4,372,128.84) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 project; and\n \nWHEREAS, the project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites and received no bidders; and\n \nWHEREAS, the project was formally re-advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from April 30, 2025 through May 15, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, one bid for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 project was received and opened on May 15, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a services contract with Synagro Central, LLC for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for the services Synagro Central, LLC provides under this contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute this contract as soon as possible in order to provide additional storage for residuals generated by the Hap Cremean Water Plant in order to reduce the City’s risk of an NPDES violation caused from discharges from the lagoons containing residuals, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \n  \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to enter into a contract for services for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 1 with Synagro Central, LLC, 435 Williams Court, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD 21220, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Department of Public Utilities, in an amount up to $4,372,128.84.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $4,372,128.84, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized to pay for the contract per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
