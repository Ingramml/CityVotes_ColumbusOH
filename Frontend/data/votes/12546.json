At the same time, 9.7 million veterans rely on their monthly Social Security benefits to cover essential needs such as housing and food.; and\n \nWHEREAS, with the current Administrations plan to cut staff dramatically to transfer federal tax dollars from our communities to reduce the taxes of billionaires, millions of Americans rely on Social Security Administration services, Medicaid or Medicare; and\n \nWHEREAS, cutting costs has led to dozens of Social Security Administration office closures even though millions of Americans depend on nearby Social Security offices for filing for benefits, resolving problems with payments, work records, generating Social Security Numbers, income and award letters, and applications for retirement, disability and Supplemental Security Income; and\n \nWHEREAS, state and federal cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security benefits, and supports the \"Keeping Our Field Offices Open Act,\" the \"Protecting Americans’ Social Security Data Act,\" and S.770, the \"Social Security Expansion Act,\" introduced on March 5, 2025; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nThat this body commits to opposing the closing of local Social Security offices.
