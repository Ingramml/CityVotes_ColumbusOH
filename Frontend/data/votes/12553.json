    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes expenditures of $300,000.00 from the Auditor Bond fund for technical and development work to the Azure and Power platform and expanded licensing, processing and storage costs for related Microsoft products. It also authorizes $48,000.00 from the General fund for ongoing maintenance support, and operational needs for the Auditor’s Office Transparency Portal. \nOrdinance No. 1352-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on May 23, 2022, authorized the contract with OnActuate for professional technical and consulting services for Azure and Power platform development. The contract contains the option to renew annually, subject to approval and appropriation of Columbus City Council. Costs were established and defined for the ongoing maintenance and support of the Transparency Portal as well as expanding and enhancing the use of Azure and power platforms.  It also allowed the purchase of licenses from existing Microsoft Enterprise Agreements through Dell. \nThis legislation authorizes the City Auditor to renew its contract with OnActuate Consulting for professional services in the amount of $273,000.00 and modify existing contracts with Microsoft Corporation and Dell Marketing LP to expand its Azure and Power platform licensing, storage, and related services to accommodate expanded functionality in the amount of $75,000.00. \nThe services under the initial contract created the Auditor’s Transparency portal. Common public records requests for expenses, revenue, payment information, and other city financial information can be viewed and downloaded directly from the site. There is a need to keep the site technologically current with software updates and to maintain functionality through a maintenance and support services agreement with OnActuate.\nAdditionally, the City Auditor’s Office desires to leverage the Azure and Power platform to further automate processes and provide more transparency functionality with new data visualizations, to create new dataverse elements for displaying from other financial system sources, and to improve and update end user interactions with its websites. \nMicrosoft is the software manufacturer of D365 and the Azure platform used by the City for its financial and operations. Agreements for the infrastructure items are to be acquired through existing Enterprise Agreements. Dell Marketing, LP; is the current State of Ohio Microsoft Enterprise Agreement and City of Columbus provider for Microsoft licensing. Additional licensing, storage, and services related to expanding and enhancing the use of the Azure and power platforms are to be procured through these previously established EA agreements. \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nThis ordinance utilizes existing appropriation in the Auditor’s Bond fund for project work as follows:\n$75,000.00                     Azure storage, Database, Data factory, Microsoft Licensing\n$225,000.00                     Services to expand and enhance Azure Data Lake, power platform, data visualizations, transparency portal, infrastructure development, and intellectual property ownership.  Additional development including: report writing, process automations, data exchanges, existing interface rework after data lake is established.\n$300,000.00                      Total from Auditor’s Bond Fund\n \n$48,000.00                      from the General Fund for maintenance, support and operational services \n \nTotal fiscal impact from both operating and capital funds is $348,000.00\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:\nOnActuate Consulting US Inc., CC#CC048102, expires 7/3/2026, D365# 048102 \nPrincipal place of business:  10900 NE 4th St, Bellevue, WA \nDell Marketing LP, CC#010030, expires 10/12/2025, D365#010030\nPrincipal place of business: 1 Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas\nTitle\nTo authorize the expenditure of up to $300,000.00 from the Auditor Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $48,000.00 from the General Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to renew a contract with OnActuate Consulting US Inc; and to authorize agreement modifications for Microsoft Corporation and Dell Marketing LP for expanded licensing, processing, and storage costs.
