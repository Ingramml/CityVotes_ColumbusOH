    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 2950-2021, passed May 9, 2022, authorized the City of Columbus (“CITY”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Pinchal & Company LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), for a real property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of approximately $53,664,206.00, which included approximately $2,911,406.00 in acquisition costs, $2,872,800.00 in leasehold improvements and $47,880,000.00 in real property improvements to construct a proactive industrial distribution and warehouse facility consisting of approximately 957,600 square-feet on undeveloped land containing approximately 182 +/- acres south of State Route 317 on Lockbourne Road, Columbus, Ohio 43137, Parcel Number 495-263119 (the “ORIGINAL PARCEL”), building #6, legislated as Pinchal & Company LLC Building 3 within the City of Columbus and within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”). Additionally, the ENTERPRISE committed to create one-hundred and nineteen (119) net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $3,712,800.00 at the PROJECT SITE. The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective August 15, 2022 with the PROJECT expected to begin approximately June 2023, with all real property improvements expected to be completed by approximately December 2024 and with the abatement to commence no later than 2025 nor extend beyond 2034 (Agreement No. 023-22-20).  \n \nAs of this date, there has not been a filing of the DTE-24 with the Franklin County Auditor, no Final Determination from the Ohio Department of Taxation, and so no forgone tax benefit has yet been received. \n \nParagraph fourteen within Section 8 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY” and paragraph fifteen of that same section states that “any requested amendment…to any of the terms of the AGREEMENT…shall require the payment to the CITY by the ENTERPRISE of an AMENDMENT FEE in the amount of five-hundred dollars ($500.00).”\n \nIn a letter from 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC on behalf of the ENTERPRISE dated April 30, 2025, received by the CITY and through ensuing correspondence, 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC confirmed that they had acquired ownership of a portion of the PROJECT SITE following an assignment of the purchase and sale agreement for the PROJECT SITE from ENTERPRISE to its affiliate, Prushing Farms Partners, LLC on May 18, 2022, recorded August 22, 2022 in Franklin County, Ohio records, which subsequently conveyed the PROJECT SITE to its wholly owned subsidiary 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC on April 28, 2025, with the transfer having been recorded at the County Recorder’s Office on May 21, 2025. In addition, the PROJECT SITE has been revised to be Parcel Number 495-345881 (split from the ORIGINAL PARCEL) containing approximately 54.396 +/- acres of undeveloped land with the current street address of 6780 Schieser Farms Road, Columbus, Ohio 43137. This street address may or may not change upon PROJECT completion.  \n \nDue diligence has been undertaken by the CITY in that 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC has agreed to fully assume the terms and commitments of the ENTERPRISE pursuant to the AGREEMENT, has submitted an updated Economic Development Incentive Application, the five-hundred dollars ($500.00) Amendment Fee and that this application and all other pertinent information has been reviewed and vetted.  \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to (1) remove Pinchal & Company LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, whereby 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC will assume the terms and commitments of the AGREEMENT, (2) revise the description of the PROJECT SITE, (3) to revise the PROJECT’s expected start and completion date in Section 1 of the AGREEMENT, (4) to revise the exemption window in Section 3 of the AGREEMENT, and (5) revise the notice information related to ENTERPRISE within Section 8 of the AGREEMENT.    \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement for the first time for Assignment & Assumption with 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC, to remove Pinchal & Company LLC as Enterprise and party to the Agreement and to be replaced with 6780 Schieser Farms, LLC as Enterprise and party to the Agreement, to redefine the Project Site, revise the Project's expected begin and completion date, revise the exemption window, and to revise the notification information.
