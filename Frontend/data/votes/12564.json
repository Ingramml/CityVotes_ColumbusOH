Fourth Street and owned by 1206 N 4TH LLC. The special assessments repay and secure financing for special energy improvement projects installed at the property. The financing was provided by Greenworks Lending LLC (together with its successors and assigns, including, without limitation, PACEWell 5 LLC, “Greenworks”). \n \nThe Owner and Greenworks have notified the City that the financing provided for the special energy improvement projects has been prepaid in full and have requested that the City reduce the special assessments previously levied down to $0.00.\n \nThis legislation is to reduce the amount of the special assessments previously levied down to $0.00 and to cause the County Auditor to remove the special assessments from the tax bills for the property. \n \nEmergency action is requested on this legislation to allow the reduction of the special assessments to be certified to the County Auditor before real property tax bills for tax year 2024 are prepared.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo remove special assessments previously levied for certain public improvements in the City of Columbus, Ohio in cooperation with the Columbus Regional Energy Special Improvement District (1206 N 4TH LLC Project); and to declare an emergency.
