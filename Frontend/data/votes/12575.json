    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to issue an electric easement to Encova Service Corporation in order to provide additional lighting in the vacated right of way alley near Topiary Park.\n \nEncova Service Corporation and the City of Columbus duly vacated an alleyway adjacent to Topiary Park, known as Library Park North, in order to obtain a safer pedestrian thoroughfare for park users and for the new Encova Service Corporation residential development. As a result, Encova Service Corporation, as part of the residential development, requested to work with the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department to provide additional lighting in the vacated right of way alley. The intent was to provide a safer, well-lit area for residents and park users alike. The City negotiated the terms of the electric easement, to allow for the installation of decorative matching light posts and the underground electrical wiring. Encova Service Corporation agreed to tie into existing lighting on private property and to pay for the resulting lighting utility bills. In 2018, the Recreation and Parks Commission and City Council approved the electric easement, per Ordinance 3110-2018, approving 0.078 acres of parkland to be shared as an electric easement for the lighting.  \n \nEncova Service Corporation had many challenges during development, one of which was a fire that resulted in the demolition of the existing construction, as well as, reconstructing the foundation and the first level of residential construction. As a result, in 2023, Encova Service Corporation was required to move some of the construction elements, one of which was the need for additional utility space within the private property. This impacted the need to move the electric line outside of the agreed to and issued easement.  As a result, Encova Service Corporation has now requested to move the utility easement, shifting slightly to the south, in Topiary Park. The City negotiated the terms of a new easement. The new easement was valued at $5,000.00. This new easement will replace the existing referenced 2018 easement. Encova Service Corporation will pay the cost of $5,000.00 for the new easement and Encova Service Corporation will also maintain the lighting.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEncova Service Corporation\n471 East Broad Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nTodd Haywood, (614) 225-1545\n \nBenefits to the Public: The electric service benefits the community as it will provide a well-lit and safer environment. The vacated alley way is often used as a thoroughfare for pedestrian access to Topiary Park, the downtown Main Library, Cristo Ray School, and the Encova Service Corporation apartments.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has supported additional lighting for safety and security. This lighting is for the benefit of nearby residents, visitors, and the overall community. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Near East (56)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by expanding partnerships and providing amenities to the community. The partnership with Encova Service Corporation supports the master plans initiative to provide community needs in working with public entities. Encova Service Corporation maintains the lighting and the utility bills.  \n \nFiscal Impact: The new easement was valued at $5,000.00 and Encova Service Corporation will pay the City of Columbus for the easement. The funds will be deposited into the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund 2223, Subfund 222355. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to issue an electric easement to Encova Service Corporation in order to provide additional lighting in the vacated right of way alley near Topiary Park. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to issue an electric easement to Encova Service Corporation in order to provide additional lighting in the vacated right of way alley near Topiary Park; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operations of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is necessary to authorize the Director to issue this easement; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
