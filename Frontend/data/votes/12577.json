    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This legislation is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management, with the approval of the Recreation and Parks Department Director, Director of the Department of Public Utilities and Director of Finance and Management to amend their Lease Agreement with Adaptive Sports Connection  (Hereinafter \"ASC\") in conjunction with their adaptive sports activities from O’Shaughnessy Reservoir as authorized in Ordinance 0425-2025. ASC is the recipient of a grant through the Ohio Division of Natural Resources (“ODNR”) which requires an interest in property related to the grant for fifteen (15) years and requires any leases held by the grantee to not be terminated solely by the landlord. Therefore, in order for ASC to receive the state grant, its lease agreement with the city must be amended to remove the provision that allows the city to terminate the lease unilaterally. The city will only do this because of the grant implications for ASC and is being done in this ordinance only to allow ASC to comply with ODNR grant requirements that are being utilized specifically for the property it is leasing from the city, authorized by Ordinance 0425-2025.\nPrincipal Parties: \nAdaptive Sports Connection\n6000 Harriott Drive Powell, OH 43065\nSharon Schreiber, 614-389-3921\nContract Compliance Number #: 030387                      CC Expiration Date: \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure that ASC will meet ODNR requirements and the overall Agreement has already been authorized by Ordinance 0425-2025.\n \nCommunity input/issues: The club has been widely accepted as part of the diverse group of recreational enthusiasts that utilize O’Shaughnessy Reservoir.\nBenefits to the Public: ASC offers specialized programming to serve those that have varying physical and cognitive challenges and maintains an ongoing partnership with the Therapeutic Recreation Section of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department.\n \nArea(s) Affected: O'Shaughnessy Reservoir and Far Northwest Area\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by promoting blueways, encouraging passive uses of natural areas, and strengthening partnerships.\n \nFiscal Impact: None.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, with the approval of the Recreation and Parks Department Director and Director of the Department of Public Utilities to amend their Lease Agreement with Adaptive Sports Connection in conjunction with their adaptive sports activities from O’Shaughnessy Reservoir as authorized in Ordinance 0425-2025; and to declare an emergency.
