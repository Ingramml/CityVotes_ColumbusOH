    "description": ".Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City’s Recreation and Parks Department (“CRPD”) is engaged in the Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector Project, (“Public Project”).  This project will allow for a direct 1.2 mile connection for the near Northeast Community to the City’s regional trail system. The connector will be an 8-foot-wide paved path from the Alum Creek Trail at Sunbury Drive and Mock Road, heading west and connecting directly to the city’s new Hudson Street Greenway. This connection will open a seamless 3.5 mile east-west trail from I-71 to the Alum Creek Trail. By linking these two east-west projects, over 6,000 residents of the Arlington Park, Woodland Holt, Brittany Hills, Argyle Park, and East Linden neighborhoods will be within 10 minutes of walking and biking connectivity to parks, churches, schools, retail, and jobs. \n \nThe near Northeast area of Columbus lacks safe, easy access to parks, schools, regional trails, and neighborhood destinations. In 2020, CRPD received Clean Ohio Trails Funding the Ohio Department of Natural Resources towards constructing this 1.2 mile trail connector along Mock Road.  The connector will tie into the Alum Creek Trail at Sunbury Road, and directly connect to the City’s Hudson Street Greenway.  Once completed, over 4 miles of east/west connectivity will be available.\n \nThe City must acquire in good faith and accept certain fee simple title and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Sunbury Drive, Mock Road and Hudson Street Columbus, Ohio 43219 (collectively, “Real Estate”). Accordingly, CRPD requested that the City Attorney acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) in order for CRPD to timely complete the acquisition of the property. \n \nThe City previously passed ordinance number 2465-2023 authorizing the expenditure of $92,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 and ordinance number 1372-2024 authorizing the additional expenditure of $50,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747. It is now necessary to authorize the expenditure of an additional $50,000.00 to complete the acquisition of the property.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Not applicable. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $50,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this acquisition.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Emergency action is requested in order to immediately allow the City Attorney to spend funds to acquire and accept the Real Estate to meet commitments to the property owners that will allow Recreation and Parks to proceed with the project without unnecessary delay.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to spend City funds to acquire and accept in good faith certain fee simple title and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Sunbury Drive, Mock Road and Hudson Street Columbus, Ohio 43219, and contract for associated professional services in order for the Recreation and Parks Department to timely complete the acquisition of Real Estate for the Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector Project; to authorize the appropriation of $50,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the transfer of $50,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2024 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize and expend up to $50,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; and to declare an emergency.
