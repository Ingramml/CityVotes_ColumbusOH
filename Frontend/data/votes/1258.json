    "title": "To authorize and direct the Board of Health to extend the grant agreement term of  the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Site-based Program (COAP) Program for the period of 10/1/2018 to 9/30/2022; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Board of Health to extend the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Site-based Program (COAP) for the period of 10/1/2018 to 9/30/2022. As per Ordinance # 2883-2018, Columbus Public Health was awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs. The COAP program at Columbus Public Health leads the public safety and public health data integration project and created an interactive opioid data tool for Franklin County, Ohio.  Data is used to track impact of Franklin County Opiate Action Plan activities on overdose rates.  \n \nThe Grant Number of G501914 will remain the same. The grant period was previously 10/1/2018 to 9/30/2021 and has now been extended to 9/30/2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no fiscal impact as this is only to extend the award period.  The amount of the grant will remain the same.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to extend the grant agreement term of  the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Site-based Program (COAP) Program for the period of 10/1/2018 to 9/30/2022; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance # 2883-2018 accepted and appropriated $999,146.00 in grant funds made available through the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs for the COAP grant program (G501914) for the period of October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2021; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to extend the grant period to September 30, 2022 for the support of the COAP grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to extend the COAP grant program term date, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare and to avoid delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.     That the Board of Health is authorized and directed to extend the grant agreement term of the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Site-based Program (COAP) Program for the period of 10/1/2018 to 9/30/2022.\n \nSECTION 2.     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City’s financial reports.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
