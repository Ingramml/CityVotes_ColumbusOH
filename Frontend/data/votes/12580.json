Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University; to authorize an expenditure and reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to issuance of a purchase order in the amount of $36,500.00 from the Office of Education’s 2025 general fund budget; and to declare an emergency ($36,500.00).",
    "description": "Explanation\nOrdinance 1931-2023 was approved by Columbus City Council on July 31, 2023.  This ordinance authorized the Office of Education to contract with numerous early learning providers as part of the 2023-2024 Early Start Columbus Program, and authorized the expenditure of $5,931,325.00 from Education’s 2023 general fund budget.\nUnfortunately, not enough funding was requested by the Office of Education to compensate all of the providers for their important work, and a contract was not established with the A. Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University.  Because of this error, the A. Sophie Rogers School provided services to the city, but was not compensated.\nTherefore, the Office of Education requests the authority to enter into a contract with the A. Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University, previously authorized by Ordinance 1931-2023, and for the financial authority to compensate the A. Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order. \nThis agreement will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Section 329.29. No city employee has either the capacity or experience to engage in this work.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $36,500.00 from the 2025 Mayor’s Office of Education General Fund budget. These funds are budgeted and available in the general fund.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency clause is added to this ordinance to compensate the A. Sophie Rogers School as soon as possible as this account is long overdue.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Office of Education to enter into a new contract previously authorized by Ordinance 1931-2023 with the A.

Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University, and this funding shortfall has resulted in a lack of sufficient funds to compensate the A. Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University for work already completed under said contracts; and\nWHEREAS, the Office of Education seeks authority to authorize the reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to issuance of a purchase order authorized by Ordinance 1931-2023 to include an additional expenditure of $36,500.00; and\nWHEREAS, the additional $36,500.00 in funding will be provided from the Office of Education’s 2025 general fund budget; and\nWHEREAS, this ordinance is necessary to ensure prompt payment for services rendered and to uphold the city’s contractual obligations;\nWHEREAS, this agreement is being awarded to the Ohio State University pursuant to Section 329.29 of Columbus City Codes, for which the city does not supply such services; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a new agreement with the Ohio State University and expend such funds so that the Ohio State University may be quickly reimbursed for the work they have already completed, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Office of Education is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with the A.

Sophie Rogers School at the Ohio State University.\nSECTION 3. That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $36,500.00, is hereby authorized within the general fund per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \nSECTION 4. That this agreement is awarded pursuant to the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes regarding not-for-profit service contracts.\nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\nSECTION 6. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\nSECTION 7.
