    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to support the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA) and it’s Housing Assistance Program (HAP).  While COAAA has federal and state funds to support the program, a local match is required. COAAA does not currently have a source of that local match.\n \nCOAAA's Housing Assistance Program provides emergency assistance to older adults and individuals with disabilities who face unforeseen hardships that threaten their ability to maintain housing and utility services. Older adults are especially vulnerable to housing insecurity as it has an increased impact on their physical and cognitive health. Older adults access to housing is also limited by their fixed income and limited mobility.\n \nCOAAA is a member of the Central Ohio Stable Housing Network (COSHN) through the Department of Development. HAP supplements ERA funding as it focuses on older adults and people with disabilities. COAAA secures state and federal funds to support this program. However, these funds require a local contribution. City Council is providing assistance to meet this matching fund requirement. While the program supports older adults across the Central Ohio Region, all City of Columbus funds are reserved for Columbus residents.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $100,000.00 of unappropriated cash will fund this ordinance.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is requested so that funding is not interrupted for emergency housing assistance for vulnerable older adults and those with disabilities.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize appropriation to City Council in the general fund for purposes of transfer to the Director of Recreation and Parks, on behalf of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging, in support of its Housing Assistance Program; to authorize a transfer between the general fund and the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency ($100,000.00)  \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, COAAA's Housing Assistance Program provides emergency assistance to older adults and individuals with disabilities who face unforeseen hardships that threaten their ability to maintain housing and utility services; and\n \nWHEREAS, older adults are especially vulnerable to housing insecurity as it has an increased impact on their physical and cognitive health; and\n \nWHEREAS, COAAA has obtained emergency housing assistance funding for its Housing Assistance Program, but needs a local matching contribution; and \n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing support of $100,000.00 in support of these needs; and \n \nWHEREAS, $100,000.00 is available for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Director of Recreation and Parks in that it is necessary for the Director to ensure funding is not interrupted for emergency housing assistance for vulnerable older adults and those with disabilities, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $100,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 and transfer $100,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 to the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund, fund 2286, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $100,000.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund, fund 2286, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the expenditure of $100,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund, fund 2286, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance, for the purpose of providing emergency housing assistance for eligible individuals.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
