    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus has been awarded a Federal Fiscal Year 2024 Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Award from the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Office of Justice Programs via the Franklin County Office of Justice Policy and Programs.  The JAG program provides funding to allow states and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime and improve the criminal justice system.  The FY24 JAG award will provide funds based off of the proposal submitted for this grant; The Organized Crime Bureau’s Drug Task Force for the Columbus Police Department (CPD), will use the funds to acquire a handheld Mass Spectrometry (MS) chemical detection system, capable of analyzing gases/vapors, liquids, and solids. This cutting-edge technology will significantly enhance our capabilities in environmental monitoring, public safety, and scientific research to ensure that our first responders are able to detect the prevalence of harmful matter. The FY24 JAG award will also provide funds for the Mounted Police Unit, to purchase a four-horse gooseneck trailer. The existing equipment is old, outdated, and in need of replacement to ensure the safe transportation of horses to community and neighborhood events.
