    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the contract for the option to purchase Structural Firefighting Boots with Phoenix Safety Outfitters LLC, and to declare an emergency. (0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Structural Firefighting Boots with Phoenix Safety Outfitters LLC CC# 007915, expires 8/28/2025.  This contract provides for Firefighting Boots for the Division of Fire.  This modification is necessary to allow for additional items to be added the current contract. The contract, PO295314, was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ019600 and will expire 9/30/2025.\n \nPer the requirements of Section 329.09(a) of City Code:\n(1)                     Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested. Agencies will be able to order the new item once added to the contract and will separately seek any approvals necessary for such orders.\n(2)                     Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: This modification will allow for a rubber firefighter boot to be added to the UTC, as it was not included with the original specifications on RFQ019600 and was being ordered on an as-needed basis. Such item has been on prior UTCs.\n(3)                     Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: The original contract was formally bid and adding the rubber firefighter boot to this existing contract makes purchasing more efficient and provides availability of the item for the duration of this UTC. \n      (4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: A quote was requested and received from the current UTC vendor for the additional firefighter boot to be added to the current contract.  The original terms and conditions will be modified to allow for additional items to be added to the current contract. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation to be considered an emergency because the need for the additional item, necessary to firefighting, is urgent. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Department of Public Safety must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the contract for the option to purchase Structural Firefighting Boots with Phoenix Safety Outfitters LLC, and to declare an emergency. (0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Structural Firefighting Boots for use by the Division of Fire; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing Universal Term Contract with Phoenix Safety Outfitters LLC , to include a Firefighter Rubber Boot; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety to have access to additional boots immediately and in that it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify a Universal Term Contract for the option to obtain Structural Firefighting Boots, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify a contract for option to obtain Structural Firefighting Boots with Phoenix Safety Outfitters LLC.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
