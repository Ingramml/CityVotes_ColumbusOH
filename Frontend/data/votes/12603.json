    "title": "To accept the application (AN25-009) of City of Columbus for the annexation of certain territory containing 980.44± acres in Blendon Township.",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance approves the acceptance of certain territory (AN25-009) by the City of Columbus and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to file a petition with the Franklin County Board of Commissioners to conform the boundaries of Blendon Township to be co-extensive with the corporate limits of the City of Columbus per an annexation agreement between the City and the Township. City Council, by Ordinance No. 0067-2025, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to file a petition for the annexation of the territory now being accepted.  The Ohio Revised Code (ORC) stipulates that to be effective, City acceptance must take place a minimum of 60 days from the receipt by the City Clerk of the approval notice from the county. If City Council does not accept the ordinance within 120 days of its first consideration, the annexation will be considered rejected. This petition was filed with Franklin County on March 7, 2025. An Amended Petition was subsequently filed on April 16, 2025. Franklin County approved the annexation on April 22, 2025, and the City Clerk received notice of the approved Amended Petition on April 24, 2025. No service ordinance was required because this annexation was filed as a Type 1 application as defined by the ORC. \nThe use of a Type 1 annexation application is stipulated in the annexation agreement between the City and Blendon Township. The annexation agreement also requires Columbus to submit a boundary conformance petition to Franklin County within six (6) months following the acceptance of the Amended Petition.  This ordinance authorizes the submission of such a boundary conformance petition to the Board of County Commissioners of Franklin County, Ohio requesting that the boundary lines of Montgomery Township be changed to make them identical with the corporate limits of the City of Columbus for this annexation. The petition will be filed in accordance with Section 503.07 of the Ohio Revised Code.\nFISCAL IMPACT: \nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \nTitle\nTo accept the application (AN25-009) of City of Columbus for the annexation of certain territory containing 980.44± acres in Blendon Township.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a petition for the annexation of certain territory in Blendon Township was filed on behalf of the City of Columbus on March 7, 2025, and was subsequently amended on April 16, 2025, as authorized by Ordinance No. 0067-2025; and\nWHEREAS, the petition was considered and approved by the Franklin County Board of Commissioners at a hearing on April 22, 2025; and\nWHEREAS, on April 24, 2025, the City Clerk received from Franklin County a certified copy of the resolution approving the amended petition; and\nWHEREAS, sixty days have now elapsed since receipt of the resolution in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code; and \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to accept the annexation of the territory addressed by the petition; NOW, THEREFORE, \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n see attachment A",
