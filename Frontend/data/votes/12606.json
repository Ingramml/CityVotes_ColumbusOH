    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into professional service contract with Sky Nile Consulting for the purpose of conducting an awareness campaign to protect vulnerable homeowners from predatory real estate wholesaling practices. \n \nIn 2024, Council adopted 3505-2024, which created a Residential Property Wholesaler Registry to ensure ethical practices associated with wholesaling by capturing information around wholesaling transactions and requiring disclosure of information to homeowners. Wholesaling can harm homeowners by targeting those in financial distress or those without sufficient information about their rights. Predatory wholesaling practices threatens the stability of homeowners and their ability to accrue intergenerational wealth. \n \nSky Nile Consulting will support this effort through an awareness and education campaign focused on the homeowners most vulnerable to predatory real estate wholesaling practices. Their work will include  plain-language education, culturally relevant assets, and grassroots outreach to ensure at-risk residents understand their rights and are aware of the Wholesaler Registry as a trusted resource. The total cost of the work will be $40,000 with $15,000 from the City of Columbus and $25,000 from the Columbus Realtors Association. \n \nSky Nile Consulting is a full-service marketing and branding agency that has substantial knowledge of the housing landscape in Columbus, having worked on the Housing For All campaign and Rise Together, among others. Deliverables will include a strategic memo on key messages, visual identity and slogan/tagline, and outreach; three short animated or live-action videos (30-60 seconds), five print-ready educational pieces, “Ask Before You Sign” homeowner checklist, and a social media toolkit (ten static graphics, five video clips, sample captions). Sky Nile Consulting will also partner with five to seven trusted community organizations for street-level outreach and conduct outreach via Facebook and Instagram, ad buys on relevant digital outlets, and paid placements on local radio with call-to-action. The final deliverable includes a wrap-up report with partner feedback and recommendations for ongoing education and expansion\n \nThe work will be completed within twelve weeks of initiation. \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to initiate education and outreach to address the wholesaling issues.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into contract with Sky Nile Consulting for an education campaign about real estate wholesaling practice; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($15,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Sky Nile Consulting will support the City of Columbus in the Wholesaler Registry and education initiative through strategic outreach and communications; and\n \nWHEREAS, Sky Nile’s focus will be on education, outreach, and awareness building to support homeowners most vulnerable to predatory real estate wholesaling practices; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily business of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with Sky Nile Consulting in order to initiate planning and implementation of education on wholesaling practices as the requirement to register approaches the July 1 deadline, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
