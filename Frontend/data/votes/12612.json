    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to fund year three (3) of the existing three (3) year contract with Dayforce US, Inc., and to provide funding for the support, hosting, services, hardware, and maintenance of Dayforce software as a service. This ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of up to $1,868,150.00 from the Department of Technology operating fund, and authorizes the expenditure of $80,000.00 from the Employee Benefits fund. \n \nDayforce US, Inc. was formerly known as Ceridian HCM, Inc and the company name and branding change occurred in 2024; however, the company structure, federal tax identification, and other pertinent details related to the contract remain the same. \n \nThe current contract for these services was authorized by Ordinance 1919-2023, which passed July 17, 2023, and was renewed by Ordinance 1197-2024, which passed June 10, 2024. The agreement has pricing and services extended for three years, subject to annual authorization and appropriation by City Council. This is the third year of the agreement and includes licensing, hosting, maintenance, support, and professional services for the Dayforce system and time clocks manufactured by Dayforce US, Inc. for enterprise-wide benefits administration, payroll, personnel management, and employee self-service system. Finally, professional services related to managing configurations for the overall system and additional benefits administration-related professional services are included in this agreement. These additional services are being procured to support planned changes and updates to the city’s various benefits plans, open enrollment planning, and any changes necessary to facilitate exports or reporting. By bundling the hours with services related to this contract, the city can receive these services at a reduced rate.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance will fund year three of the three-year extended term for Dayforce subscription and services including maintenance and support of time clocks across city departments and additional funding lines for clocks in the Department of Public Utilities and Department of Technology from available and approved funding in the Department of Technology, Information Services fund as follows:\n \nAmount and Description\n$1,850,000.00                     Dayforce subscription, maintenance and support, and services \n$17,490.00                     Department of Public Utilities clocks maintenance and support \n$660.00                                          Department of Technology clocks maintenance and support \n$1,868,150.00                     TOTAL\n \nFor benefits related professional services, funding is available in the Employee Benefits fund in the amount of $80,000.00.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe vendor contract compliance number is CC-025904 and is valid through May 7, 2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to modify the existing contract with Dayforce US, Inc. for the renewal of the Dayforce software subscription, support, hardware, and services; to authorize the expenditure of $1,868,150.00 from the Department of Technology operating fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $80,000.00 from the Employee Benefits fund.
