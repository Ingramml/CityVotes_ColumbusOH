    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Community Reinvestment Areas (CRAs) have been designated by Columbus City Council (\"Council\") under the general guidelines of Ordinance 1698-78. Such areas allow for the granting of real property tax incentives to encourage industrial, commercial, and residential growth.\n \nColumbus City Council by Resolution Number 0090X-2007, as approved on June 11, 2007 and certified by the State of Ohio on July 14, 2007, created the Rickenbacker Community Reinvestment Area (the \"Rickenbacker CRA\"), which Council subsequently amended by Resolution Number 03I8X-2011 on December 5, 2011 and certified by the State of Ohio on January 23, 2012, providing for tax exemptions for improvements to real property up to one hundred percent (100%) not exceeding fifteen (15) years for the new construction of non-retail, non-hotel, non-residential business or industrial structures as described in Section 3735.67 of the Ohio Revised Code.\n \nBeginning in the early 1960’s, Morris Dach began buying and selling used restaurant equipment out of his garage in the hopes of finding a cost-efficient way to help other restauranteurs start and expand their businesses. Then in 1966, Morris officially opened up an equipment warehouse store in Columbus, Ohio which offered food service equipment and supplies directly to operators throughout the area. This quickly became successful and led to the development of various trusted relationships with leading manufacturers in the industry which only continued to aid the business. Since then, the Morris family still continues to run and expand the business both locally and nationally and has become one of the largest restaurant equipment warehouse companies in the country. \n \nDach Family Limited Partnership is proposing to invest a total project cost of approximately $8.0 million in real property improvements to expand their existing distribution facility of 171,000 square feet by another 109,000 square feet (totaling approximately 280,000 square feet) at 6375 LaSalle Dr. Columbus, OH 43137, parcel number 495-263842 (the “Project Site”). Additionally, Dach Family Limited Partnership proposes the creation of four (4) net new full-time permanent positions with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $191,360.00 (“New Employees”) and the retention of twenty-two (22) full-time jobs with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $1,381,961.00 at the proposed Project Site.\n \nThe Director of the Department of Development is recommending the Council approve a Community Reinvestment Area property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive years on real property improvements related to construction of 109,000 square foot expansion to the 171,000 square foot distribution facility. This proposal is consistent with the Columbus Tax Incentive Policy for Community Reinvestment Area projects. \n \nThe Columbus City School District has been advised of this project.\n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Community Reinvestment Area Agreement with Dach Family Limited Partnership for a property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive years on real property improvements in consideration of the proposed total investment of approximately $8,000,000.00 to expand its’ current distribution facility, the creation of four (4) net new full-time permanent positions with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $191,360.00 and the retention of twenty-two (22) full-time jobs with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $1,381,961.00.\n \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1698-78 passed August 3, 1978, authorized the Department of Development to implement a Community Reinvestment Area Program, pursuant to Section 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio\nRevised Code, and approved certain administrative procedures for the program;
