    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Fishbeck, Thompson, Carr & Huber, Inc. (Fishbeck) to add additional funds for Intersection - Roberts Road at Frazell Road-Spindler Road project.  This modification is to design the remaining detailed design and also for the expanded scope of the project to add walk to the Bridgestone Apartment Drive as requested by residents through the public involvement process.\nOrdinance No. 0653-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $500,000.00 professional services contract with Fishbeck for the Intersection - Roberts Road at Frazell Road-Spindler Road project.   This project consists of design improvements to reconfigure the intersections of Roberts Road with Frazell Road and Spindler Road into a double compact urban roundabout. Pedestrian and bikeway improvements are included through the Frazell Road and Spindler Road intersections and extended to the nearest intersection in each direction.\n \nOrd. 1780-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to submit ODOT Highway Safety Improvement Program project applications and to execute project agreements for awarded projects for the Department of Public Service for the Intersection - Roberts Road at Frazell Road-Spindler Road project.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $500,000.00 for additional design work for the remaining detailed design and also for the expanded scope of the project.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $500,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00     (PO384446, Ord. 0653-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $500,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $1,000,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary for additional effort that was not anticipated from original contract scope that came from the public involvement process. Work includes designing the remaining detailed design and also for the expanded scope of the project to add walk to the Bridgestone Apartment Drive as requested by residents through the public involvement process.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe contract modification is needed to keep the project on schedule and meet project funding fiscal years.  It would be redundant to have a separate contract to perform this work.  Therefore, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract to keep to the current consultant instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Fishbeck.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Fishbeck is CC011999 and expires 09/26/26.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond\nFund. An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of funds is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to complete needed improvements at the earliest possible time and meet the requirements of the start date for the ODOT Highway Safety Improvement Program funding award to avoid penalty and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Fishbeck in connection with the Intersection - Roberts Road at Frazell Road-Spindler Road project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.
