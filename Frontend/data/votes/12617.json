    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to release a recorded drainage easement on parcel 240-006842 within the Galloway Natural Area in the City’s Westland Community. This ordinance will also authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to accept and record a new drainage easement within said parcel for the purpose of reducing storm water runoff across the Galloway Natural Area. Lastly, this ordinance will authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to amend the existing deed restrictions on parcel 240-006842 with the Ohio Public Works Commission.\n \nIn 2009, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department received Clean Ohio grant funding to acquire 148 acres of natural area on the far west side of Columbus near Galloway. As part of the acquisition, a 40 foot wide drainage easement was retained by the seller on parcel 240-006842 for future large development storm water runoff. In 2024, Columbus Recreation and Parks met with T & R Properties, Inc., Franklin County Engineers, and Prairie Township to develop an improved method of drainage outfall to significantly reduce the runoff across the Galloway Natural Area.  \n \nTo achieve this result, the developer will release the original 2009 drainage easement of 0.21 acre back to the City of Columbus. The Recreation and Parks Department will also need to grant a new drainage easement of 0.08 acre. This should reduce the current runoff across the Galloway Natural Area by approximately 50 percent. The result will increase the Recreation and Parks Department’s protected natural land, improve the long-term health of the entire Galloway Natural Area, and help protect the water quality in the Hellbranch Run Watershed. The Ohio Public Works Commission has approved this approach. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nT & R Properties, Inc.\n3895 Stoneridge Lane                                                     \nDublin, Ohio 43017 \nRon Sabatino, (614) 923-4000   \n                                              \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the drainage easement transactions must be completed in order for the owner to receive final site compliance for their project, so the easement can be recorded, and so the deed restrictions can be amended, allowing the benefits of storm water reduction to be realized by the public as soon as possible. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The drainage easement will further protect the Galloway Natural Area and improve water quality for the Hellbranch Run Watershed.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The surrounding neighborhood has expressed the desire for protected greenspace and protecting water quality in the Hellbranch Run Watershed. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Westland (52)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality recreational parkland and protecting environmentally sensitive land along stream corridors.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to release a recorded drainage easement on parcel 240-006842 within the Galloway Natural Area in the City’s Westland Community; to accept and record a new drainage easement within said parcel for the purpose of reducing storm water runoff across the Galloway Natural Area; to amend the existing deed restrictions on parcel 240-006842 with the Ohio Public Works Commission; and to declare an emergency.
