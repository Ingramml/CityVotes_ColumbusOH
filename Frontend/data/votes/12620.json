($13,816.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (hereinafter \"Municipal Court Clerk\") to enter into the second year of a five (5) year contract in the amount of $13,816.00 with the Ohio State University/Ohio Academic Resource Network (hereinafter OARnet) for the provision of Virtual Machine Ware (hereinafter VMware) software licenses and maintenance services for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office.  The contract was originally authorized by Ordinance No. 3356-2024.\nVMware licenses are necessary for the operation and management of our virtualized IT infrastructure. This infrastructure allows the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office to consolidate multiple physical servers into fewer, more powerful virtual servers, improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing flexibility.\nIt is necessary to purchase VMware licenses to maintain Municipal Court Clerk’s virtualized server infrastructure, ensuring its security, performance, and compliance with the new licensing model imposed by Broadcom's acquisition.\nThe acquisition of VMware by Broadcom has led to significant changes in VMware's licensing model and the available discounted offerings through OARnet.\nBid Information:\nOARnet maintenance and support has been ongoing for over ten (10) years.\nOrdinance No. 0582-87 authorizes the City of Columbus to purchase from cooperative purchasing contracts which are not put out for bid but are negotiated contracts.\nOARnet is an initiative of the State of Ohio with Ohio State University functioning as its fiscal arm. It is the State of Ohio Cooperative Purchasing (CO-OP) membership that allows the purchase of VMware from OARnet. The State of Ohio does not have a state contract number or STS (State Term Schedule) associated with VMware. The State of Ohio is utilizing an existing Ohio Revised Code as their purchase authority for VMware: ORC 127.16(D)(23), Purchasing by Competitive Selection. Under this code, the State is allowed to purchase from other state agencies, including state-assisted institutions of higher education, without the restrictions related to non-competitive bids.\nTherefore, this legislation waives the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code, Chapter 329 to contract with OARnet. It is in the best interest of the City to waive competitive bidding, for the continuity of the software maintenance and to facilitate significant changes in VMware's licensing model and the available discounted offerings through OARnet.\nContract Compliance Number: 31-6025986\nExpiration Date: 06/10/2027\nVendor#: 006163\n Contracts:\nOrdinance: 3356-2024: $12,572.80: PO485905\nOrdinance 1542-2025: $13,816.00\nFiscal Impact: Sufficient funds are available within the Clerk's 2025 computer fund budget.\nEmergency: There is an immediate need to purchase VMware licenses to maintain the Municipal Court Clerk virtualized server infrastructure, ensuring its security, performance, and compliance with the new licensing model imposed by Broadcom's acquisition.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Municipal Court Clerk to enter into contract with the Ohio State University/OARnet for the provision of VMware software licenses and maintenance services; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City code; to authorize an expenditure of $13,816.00 from the Municipal Court Clerk computer fund; and to declare an emergency. ($13,816.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the VMware licenses are necessary for the operation and management of our virtualized IT infrastructure.
