    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a subscription to its comprehensive records management system (RMS).  In 2023, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, published a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a comprehensive records management system (RMS). In the past, the Division of Fire has maintained separate contracts for records management services. The goal of this RFP was to contract with a company that can provide a comprehensive record management system that meets all of the City’s technology requirements and provides all of the necessary incident report platforms. After evaluation, in compliance with the Revised Code of the State of Ohio, the Charter of the City of Columbus, Columbus City Code Section 329.28 and Title 39, the selection committee recommended entering into contract with ImageTrend, LLC for the records management system. A contract was authorized for the purchase of ImageTrend, LLC’s comprehensive records management system and first year of service via ordinance 1953-2024 that will expire on July 31, 2025.\n \nA contract for a subscription to ImageTrend, LLC’s comprehensive records management system is necessary to continue to provide access to EMS and Fire Incident reporting, in addition to fire inspection reporting software. Each year, the Columbus Division of Fire (CFD) responds to over 170,000 calls for service. Each EMS incident requires an incident report to be completed in a NEMSIS 3.4 compliant format that meets national standards. That information creates a permanent patient record that is maintained by the Division of Fire. This report is used as justification for EMS transport billing, which generates approximately $20 million annually in revenue for the City's General Fund. The incident reports are also used to share information with local hospitals and are referenced for continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts to ensure CFD maintains a high level of EMS/pre-hospital care. The information is also maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. Also, each fire incident is required to have an incident report completed in NFIRS 5.0 format that meets national standards. That information is maintained as a public record and is submitted to the Ohio Fire Marshal’s office and the US Fire Administration to provide data for the national fire incident database. The information is also maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. Additionally, each commercial occupancy and multi-family occupancy unit is inspected on an annual basis. The CFD Fire Prevention Bureau inspects over 35,000 buildings to ensure they maintain compliance with the Ohio Fire Code and the Local City Fire code. The Fire Prevention Bureau also issues permits for various fire code requirements. The information is also maintained in a local database for analytics and annual reporting. ImageTrend, LLC's product performs all of the above functions, along with providing various record keeping modules. These record keeping tools aid in the efficiency of maintaining inventory of various tools, supplies and other items that the Division of Fire must create records to maintain. \n \nThe term of this contract is for three (3) years with the option for two (2) additional one (1) year renewals with subsequent one (1) year annual renewals thereafter by mutual agreement.  Funding for this contract will be encumbered on a year-to-year basis contingent upon the approval of City Council and certification of funds by the City Auditor.  \nThe cost for each of the first five (5) years have been negotiated and quoted.\nYear 1: $569,431.20\nYear 2: $592,208.45\nYear 3: $615,896.79\nYear 4: $640,532.66\nYear 5: $666,153.96\nTotal: $3,084,223.05\n \nContract Compliance: ImageTrend, Inc., Federal Tax ID: 41-1903871, Vendor # 023084\nBid Waiver Justification:  The Division of Fire successfully implemented this specialized comprehensive records management solution in 2024 with ImageTrend, LLC and does not seek an alternative solution at this time.  The service is an indispensable agent utilized by the Division of Fire to provide EMS and Fire Incident reporting, in addition to fire inspection reporting software.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $569,431.20 from the General Fund to ImageTrend, LLC for a subscription to this comprehensive records management system.  The Division of Fire expended $624,730.00 for the 2024 - 2025 contract period.\n \nEmergency Designation:  This ordinance is being processed as an emergency measure in order to establish a contract and issue a purchase order prior to August 1, 2025 to prevent an interruption of service.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a subscription to its comprehensive records management system; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $569,431.20 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
