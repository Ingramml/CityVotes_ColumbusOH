City of Columbus et al., Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Case No. 24-CV-3732 (the “Lawsuit”), in the amount of One Hundred Ninety-One Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($191,000.00). \nThe Lawsuit was brought by Plaintiff Patricia Gerlach-Hesson against the City of Columbus and two employees of the Columbus Division of Fire, Tyler Conners and Timothy Boyd.  The lawsuit arises out of an auto-collision involving a vehicle in which Plaintiff was a passenger and a fire engine operated by City Firefighter Tyler Conners. \nOn or about July 23, 2023 Tyler Conners was driving Engine 5 going northbound on Interstate 270. Then-Lieutenant Timothy Boyd was the ranking officer on Engine 5 that night.  Engine 5 was called off of an emergency run, and Firefighter Conners began merging to the left in order to make a left-hand turn into an emergency vehicle turnaround. While Engine 5 was in Lane 2 (second from the left), slowing, and beginning to turn into the turnaround, a sedan in Lane 1 (the left-most lane) attempted to pass Engine 5. The sedan was unable to do so and collided with Engine 5 in the left median near the entrance to the turnaround. Both Engine 5 and the sedan came to a stop with the rear corner of Engine 5 still protruding into Lane 1. The decedent, Timothy Wiggins (age 63), was driving a pickup truck in Lane 1 and collided with the rear of Engine 5. Plaintiff was a passenger in that vehicle. Mr. Wiggins was immediately killed by that impact. Plaintiff suffered minor injuries in the accident. The Lawsuit alleges claims of negligence and respondeat superior. This settlement will allow for resolution of all of the Plaintiff’s claims relating to the July 23, 2023 vehicle collision.\nFiscal Impact:                       \nThis ordinance authorizes the settlement of a lawsuit captioned Patricia Gerlach-Hesson v.
