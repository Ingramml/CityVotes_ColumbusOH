additional funds for software maintenance, technical support, and continued services in the amount of $350,000.00 for the Refuse Data Collection System. \n \nThe Department of Public Service, Office of Support Services, solicited Requests for Proposals for the Street Equipment-Refuse Data Collection System contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Bonfire and Vendor Services websites from October 23, 2018, to November 29, 2018.  The City received one (1) response.  The proposal was deemed responsive and was fully evaluated when the Evaluation Committee met on December 6, 2018.  The responding firm was:  \nCompany Name                                                    City/State                                                      Majority/MBE\nRouteware, Inc.                                                                                                         Portland, OR                                                                MAJ\n \nRouteware, Inc. received 81.0 out of a possible 100 score from the evaluation committee.  After a satisfactory demonstration period in order to evaluate performance of the system, Routeware, Inc. was awarded the Street Equipment-Refuse Data Collection System contract.  \n \nOrdinance 1696-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter in to a professional service contract for the provision of a data collection system, and equipment, to be installed in each refuse truck for one year, with the option of five one-year renewals.  This was integrated with the existing routing system from the same vendor to gather routing and refuse collection data and allow reporting of data for management and efficiency purposes.  New equipment replaced the existing equipment that displayed routes followed by each vehicle.\n \nContract modifications were planned for funding for subsequent years of the contract.  It was anticipated the new equipment would be phased-in over a three-to-five-year period, and would require continued support of the software for an indefinite period. \n \nOrdinance 2458-2020 authorized modification 1 of the original contract to provide additional funding for phase 2 of the project, which included installation and programming of hardware and monthly service fees.  Ordinance 1245-2021 authorized modification 2 of the original contract to provide additional funding for phase 3 of the project, which included the continuation of installation and programming of hardware and monthly service fees.  Ordinance 1210-2022 authorized modification 3 of the original contract which included the continuation of installation and programming of hardware and monthly service fees.  Ordinance 1617-2023 authorized modification 4 of the original contract to provide yearly funding for continuation of installation and programming of hardware and monthly service fees.  Ordinance 1699-2024 authorized modification 5 of the original contract to provide yearly funding for continuation of monthly service fees.  This ordinance authorizes modification 6 of the original contract to provide yearly funding for continuation of monthly service fees, as anticipated in the original contract.    \n \n1.1                     Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $350,000.00\n \nOriginal contract
