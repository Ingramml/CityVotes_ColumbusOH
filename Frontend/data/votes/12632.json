It provides them with a secure place to sleep, three healthy meals a day, and support. With their basic needs met, parents can focus on making progress toward a better future. Most families that the shelter serves are working poor and cannot afford high housing costs. Many are single mothers raising their children on their own. \nThe Family Center offers a range of services, including emergency shelter, transportation services, housing-search resources, and an employment resource center. For parents, there is also the five-star Step-Up to Quality, rated Safe & Sound, child care program. This program helps parents focus on achieving their employment and housing goals. \nThe projects funded by the city will enhance interior and exterior security, improve the guest experience in the lavatories, and enhance food service.

Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting November 1, 2024.\nSanctuary Collective is committed to serving an at-risk and highly vulnerable population of women in crisis. In their three years of operation, they have provided more than 1,200 women with a safe space to access vital and lifesaving resources. They have been intentional about focusing their efforts on the Franklinton community to provide a sanctuary for exploited women in an area that has historically struggled with criminal activity. They have helped women get off the streets and into stable housing. This includes providing access to vital mental and behavioral health services, paving the way for a brighter and more stable future. The City funding will provide upgrades to the exterior of the facility and assist in addressing public safety concerns. \nFaith Mission, Inc. operates the Faith Mission single Men’s and Women’s Shelters that houses women, and men experiencing homelessness.
