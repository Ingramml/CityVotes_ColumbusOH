    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance amends Chapter 709 of the Columbus City Codes in order to define Pollinator Gardens to allow them in certain situations. This definition will provide parameters for residents who wish to grow well maintained Pollinator Gardens on their property, increase the native pollinator population, decrease the burden on the environmental court system, and create a more resilient food system. Furthermore, it solidifies the Columbus commitment to restoring monarch butterfly habitat and encouraging residents to do the same, as outlined in the National Wildlife Federation's Mayors' Monarch Pledge. \n \nThese small patches of habitat have an outsized impact on our food system and environmental health. About 75% of the world's flowering plants and 35% of our food crops depend on pollinators to grow our food. However, pollinator populations are declining dramatically, due to habitat loss, pesticide use, and changes in our climate, placing over 75 species on the endangered species list. The lack of pollinator gardens in our communities affect the green space, habitat, and ultimately the entire ecosystem, which lead to a reduced food production in communities that are already food deserts. Removing barriers to growing pollinator gardens throughout Columbus offers a simple but powerful solution to address food insecurity. These gardens provide food and shelter for pollinators while creating beautiful green spaces for residents to enjoy.\n \nAdditionally, supporting pollinator gardens directly advances goal area B5 of the Columbus and Franklin County Local Food Action Plan, which aims to quote, \"grow capacity and enhance viability of urban agriculture to allow residents to grow food for themselves and their neighbors.” Supporting pollinators will make every backyard vegetable plot, urban farm, and the 350 community gardens in Columbus and Franklin County, more productive; and higher crop yields, mean more residents have access to food. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No fiscal impact.\n \n \nTitle\nTo amend Columbus City Codes Chapter 709 to add a definition for Pollinator Gardens, to allow Pollinator Gardens in certain situations, and to clarify other definitions in that Chapter.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Pollinator Gardens are small patches of habitat that have an outsized impact on our food system and environmental health.

That City Code Chapter 709 is hereby amended as shown on the attachment hereto.\n \nSECTION 2. That the existing provisions of the Columbus City Codes amended by SECTION 1 are hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3.
