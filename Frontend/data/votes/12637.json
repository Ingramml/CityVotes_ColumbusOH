    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance amends Chapters 221 and 4307 and various sections in Titles 11, 31, and 33 of the Columbus City Codes to indicate the Department of Public Utilities will be also be known as Columbus Water & Power, updates the name of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, and repeals the existing sections being amended.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities is using the new name, Columbus Water & Power, to clarify the services performed by its staff and better explain its role in building public improvements and maintaining services to the City and surrounding areas.  The Department of Public Utilities conducted outreach to find out what the public’s understanding is of the services that it provides.  The meetings revealed that the public does not know which services are provided by the Department of Public Utilities versus other City departments or private utilities.\n \nThe Division of Sewerage and Drainage is changing all references to its name throughout the Columbus City Codes.  The change from “Division of Sewerage and Drainage” to “Division of Water Reclamation” more accurately describes the sustainable function of its operations and reflects the evolution across the industry regarding sanitary treatment and stormwater management as essential water resources. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no fiscal impact.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Titles 11, 31, and 33 and Chapters 221 and 4307 of the Columbus City Codes to indicate that the Department of Public Utilities will also be known as Columbus Water & Power; to update the name of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage to the Division of Water Reclamation; and to repeal the existing sections being amended.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities provides water supply, treatment, and distribution services to 1.4 million people across Central Ohio, oversees sanitary water reclamation and stormwater services, maintains Columbus streetlights, and supplies municipal power to a growing customer base approaching 20,000; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities conducted public outreach to gauge the public’s understanding of the services that it provides and found that the public’s perception was fundamentally inaccurate; and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to clarify to the public and its customers the services performed by its staff and better explain its role in building public improvement and maintaining services to the City and surrounding areas, it is appropriate and in the best interest of the City that the Department of Public Utilities will also be known as Columbus Water & Power; and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to more accurately describe the sustainable function of the Division and reflect the evolution across the industry regarding sanitary treatment and stormwater management as essential water resources, it is appropriate and in the best interest of the City to update the name of, and all references to, the “Division of Sewerage and Drainage” to “Division of Water Reclamation;” NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  City Council finds that it is appropriate for the Department of Public Utilities to also be known as Columbus Water & Power.\n \nSECTION 2.
