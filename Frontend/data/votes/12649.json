    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Sensit Gas Monitors with Municipal Emergency Services; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to purchase Sensit Gas Monitors with Municipal Emergency Services.  The Division of Fire is the primary user for the Sensit Gas Monitors. Sensit Gas Monitors are used by Fire Fighters to detect and alert users of dangerous gases in work areas at emergency scenes. An RFQ process is needed to establish a new contract.  The current contract expires on July 31, 2025 and there is not enough time to use a procurement process to award a new contract.  There can’t be a lapse in contract which would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Division of Fire. Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n \nThe contract, PO283413 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ018131 and authorized for extension under Ordinance Number 1150-2021 and will expire July, 31, 2025.  The City and Municipal Emergency Services have agreed to modify and extend the contract for one additional year term subject to approval of proper City Authorities. The new contract expiration date will be July 31, 2026.  \n \nPer the requirements of Section 329.09(a) of City Code:\n(1)                     the amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested. \n(2)                     why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A \n(3)                     why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: Any lapse in this contract would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Division of Fire. Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n(4)                     how the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: The pricing has not changed. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contract.  The Division of Fire must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation to be considered an emergency because the current contract expires July 31, 2025, and prompt processing will allow for no lapse in the availability of the goods/services. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Sensit Gas Monitors with Municipal Emergency Services; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Sensit Gas Monitors for use by Division of Fire; and  \n \nWHEREAS, this contract was entered into in accordance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code, pursuant to solicitation RFQ018131 with Municipal Emergency Services deemed the lowest, most responsive, responsible, and best bidder; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now the desire of the Department of Finance and Management and the Division of Fire to extend the existing contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management and the Division of Fire in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract with Municipal Emergency Services for the option to purchase Sensit Gas Monitors so that such services may continue uninterrupted as the current contract expires on July 31, 2025, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contract with Municipal Emergency Services, for a period of (1) one year, from July 1, 2025 to and including July 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
