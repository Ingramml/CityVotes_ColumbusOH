    "description": "Explanation\nThe Department of Technology seeks to implement a citywide Zero Trust Network (ZTN) to enhance cybersecurity and modernize the City’s IT infrastructure. This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify the City’s existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) with CDW Government LLC, PA005605, in the following manner: 1) to extend the term of such UTC to January 31, 2030; and 2) to include a Buy/Hold and Staging Agreement.\nThe addition of a Buy/Hold and Staging Agreement to the UTC enables CDW Government LLC to securely store City-owned networking equipment in its warehouse facilities and support phased delivery and configuration as buildings are prepared for Zero Trust Network deployment.\nZero Trust Network (ZTN)\nZero Trust Network (ZTN) is a cybersecurity framework based on the principle of \"never trust, always verify.\" It uses micro-segmentation, enterprise-wide identity verification, and continuous security checks to reduce cyber risk by containing threats and limiting exposure across the IT ecosystem.\nThe City of Columbus is implementing a ZTN as part of its broader IT Infrastructure and Optimization Initiative, which is designed to align with industry security best practices and address gaps in the current infrastructure. The initiative aims to strengthen and modernize the City’s IT systems and operations to support the evolving needs of a growing city.\nZTN implementation requires all current and future city buildings with network connectivity to be included in the architecture. The network must be approached comprehensively-beginning with the core network and the city’s largest facilities, followed by a phased rollout to additional buildings. Partial implementation that stops at the core without extending to the boundaries will fail to deliver the full benefits of Zero Trust, including network segmentation and end-to-end protection.\nPursuant to Section 329.09(a) of Columbus City Codes:\n(1) Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funding is necessary for this modification. The Department of Technology, as the user of this UTC, will secure its own funding for use of the UTC.\n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: There was not a need for the Buy/Hold and Staging Agreement at the time this UTC was initially established. The need for such agreement is directly related to the ZTN project, as explained above.\n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: Pricing for the necessary equipment for the ZTN project that will be procured via the existing UTC is expected to increase soon and this critical project needs to begin this summer. Modifying the existing UTC with the current vendor allows the Department of Technology to secure current, lower pricing for equipment while holding/staging such equipment in secure facilities and to begin the project this summer.\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: Pricing was established under the existing UTC for equipment, and the Department of Technology negotiated increased discounts with the vendor for equipment and services for the ZTN project.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThere is no fiscal impact associated with this legislation. The Department of Technology separately legislates for appropriations and expenditures related to the use of this UTC.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nCDW Government LLC Vendor/CC No. 034427, expires May 22, 2027\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency passage is requested to enable timely implementation of this critical network infrastructure beginning this summer, ensuring continued network security.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify the existing Universal Term Contract with CDW Government LLC to extend the term thereof to January 31, 2030 and to include a Buy/Hold and Staging Agreement; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus seeks to implement a citywide Zero Trust Network (ZTN) to strengthen cybersecurity and modernize its IT infrastructure; and\nWHEREAS, the Department of Technology requires the ability to stage and coordinate delivery of equipment related to the ZTN project; and\nWHEREAS, a Buy & Hold and Staging Agreement with CDW Government LLC would enable efficient scheduling and risk mitigation during deployment; and\nWHEREAS, it is desired to modify the Universal Term Contract PA005605 to extend its term to January 31, 2030 to cover the anticipated timeline of the ZTN project; and\nWHEREAS, the Universal Term Contract PA005605 must be modified to include the Buy & Hold and Staging Agreement to allow for this deployment; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Departments of Finance and Management and Technology, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the existing UTC because the implementation of this critical network infrastructure needs to begin this summer to assure continued network security and the amendment of the UTC is necessary to effectuate a method of equipment deployment to align with project timeline, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Finance and Management Department be and is hereby authorized to modify the Universal Term Contract PA005605 with CDW Government LLC to extend its term to January 31, 2030 and to add a Buy/Hold and Staging Agreement to the UTC to coordinate delivery of equipment related to the ZTN project.\nSECTION 2. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
