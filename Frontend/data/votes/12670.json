    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Michael Baker International, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the UIRF ‐ Eakin Road SUP project.\nOrdinance 1533-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Michael Baker International, Inc. to provide the City of Columbus additional resources for design of a new shared use path (SUP) along the north side of Eakin Road from South Wayne Avenue to Whitethorne Avenue and on the south side of Eakin Road from Whitethorne Avenue to Harrisburg Pike (US 62). Improvements include curb ramps, crosswalk markings, street lighting, drive aprons, curb, at‐grade RailRoad crossing, and storm sewer as needed. The project crosses a bridge over Early Run that will require modification to accommodate a 10' SUP or a separate bridge will be installed. This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $100,000.00.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $100,000.00 for additional surveying and design services are needed for additional sidewalk to connect proposed sidewalk with existing walk, and a stormwater detention basin in an area that was not included within the area of the original survey.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $100,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $640,000.00    (PO404555, Ord. 1533-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $100,000.00    (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $740,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe additional sidewalk has been added in direct response to a request from a resident during public involvement activities.  During the design process, it was determined that it would be in the City’s best interest to locate the required storwater detention basin in an area that is located outside the original survey limits for the project.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe work is to be integrated with work that is being completed by the consultant under the existing contract. \nTherefore, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract to keep to the current consultant instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe hours required for these tasks were deemed fair and reasonable when compared to other projects of similar scope and complexity.  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Michael Baker International, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Michael Baker International, Inc. is CC001926 and expires 12/04/25.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $100,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  A transfer of funds is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. Funds are appropriated.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent delays in the project schedule. This project is being partially funded by external sources with scheduling constraints.  This project must continue the design effort without delay so that the design, right-of-way acquisition, and construction procurement can be completed in a manner to meet the scheduling constraints of the City’s funding partners and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Michael Baker International, Inc. in connection with the UIRF- Eakin Road SUP project;  to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
