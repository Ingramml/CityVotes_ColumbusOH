Additional improvements include traffic signal replacement, street lighting, street trees (where feasible), storm sewer, electric distribution, and replacement of the 12\" water main between Avalon Place and E. 5th Avenue. On E. 5th Avenue, the improvements consist of roadway reconstruction with additional turn lanes at the intersection with Cassady Avenue. The sidewalk will be replaced along both sides and improvements will be made to the street lighting and storm sewer.\n \nIn the course of effecting roadway improvements, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements or place overhead utilities underground to promote public health, safety and welfare including the economic development of the City.  It is necessary to move utilities to complete this project. \n \nThe funding request for utilities relocation reimbursement is based upon estimates from the utilities.  The utilities will invoice the City for actual costs incurred in relocating the utilities.  The amount needed may exceed the amount requested in this ordinance.  Additional legislation will be submitted by the Department of Public Service if additional funds are needed to complete the relocations.     \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this expense is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested to provide funding for utility reimbursements at the earliest possible time to maintain the project construction schedule to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to pay utility relocation costs to various utilities for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $425,000.00 for utility relocations for this project from the Streets & Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($425,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is concerned with the use of the various rights-of-way areas in the City as such rights-of-way areas represent a valuable and limited resource that must be utilized to promote the public health, safety and welfare including the economic development of the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, utility relocations must be completed before construction can continue; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service requires funding to be available for utility relocation expenses for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue project; and \n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes funding in the amount of $425,000.00 for that purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize funds within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, to establish sufficient cash to pay for the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize payment for utility relocation expenses to prevent construction delays, to ensure the safety of the traveling public, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to reimburse utilities for utility relocation work, or to reimburse companies hired by utilities to perform utility relocation work for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue project.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $425,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 7704 (Streets and Highways Bond Fund), in Dept-Div 5912 (Division of Design and Construction), Project P530103-100060  (Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening), in Object Class 06 (Capital Outlay) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 6.  For the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
