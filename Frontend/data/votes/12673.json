    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Orchard, Hiltz & McCliment, Inc. dba OHM Advisors to add additional funds for the Roadway - General Engineering 2023-2 project.\nOrdinance No. 3231-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $650,000.00 professional services contract with OHM Advisors for the Roadway - General Engineering 2023-2 project.   The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, with contractual access to additional resources that are necessary to perform professional engineering and survey services as well as provide technical expertise for the Department to complete its capital budget commitments.\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $350,000.00 for additional professional services to complete the detailed design of a project within the Lockbourne Road corridor between Groveport Road intersection and the westbound SR-104 interchange ramps intersection (including the north leg of that intersection). \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $350,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $650,000.00     (PO360826, Ord. 3231-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $350,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $1,000,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification was anticipated and is needed to to complete design services within the Lockbourne Road corridor between Groveport Road intersection and the westbound SR-104 interchange ramps intersection (including the north leg of that intersection).  Plans to install multiple (4 to 5 anticipated) planted medians, street trees, and interchange landscaping will be created. Work may also include ADA and pedestrian crossing work within these limits where determined necessary in Preliminary Engineering. Work also includes minor lighting improvements.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nWhen the contract was originally awarded to OHM Advisors, the intent was always to include this task for the Lockbourne Road corridor on this Roadway GE with a contract modification.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against OHM Advisors.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for OHM Advisors is CC007505 and expires 10/16/2025.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $350,000.00 is budgeted, available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  A transfer of funds is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent delays in the project schedule. These tasks need to be authorized, plus survey work needs to begin this summer in order to construct the project in 2027 and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of funds within the  Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with OHM Advisors in connection with the Roadway - General Engineering 2023-2 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $350,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to pay for the project; and to declare an emergency.
