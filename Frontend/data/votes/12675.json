    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Camden Land Holdings, LLC asking that the City transfer all of the 8 foot alley from the original easterly Right-of-Way line of St. Clair Avenue to the extension of the westerly line of the first 15 foot alley east of said St. Clair Avenue, originally dedicated and subsequently vacated in Wooley’s Addition as numbered and delineated in Plat Book 4 page 173, Franklin County Recorder’s Office, said alley being described in a boundary survey of 1,000 square foot (0.023 acre +/-). \n                     \nThe Department processed the request and submitted legislation to Council that was passed by ordinance 3193-2024. A Quitclaim deed was then created by the City Attorney’s Office for recording at the Franklin County Recorders Office. The County determined that the Quitclaim deed was not sufficient to clear title into the adjacent owner, Camden Land Holdings, LLC, so the City withdrew the submission. To correct and clear title the Franklin County Recorder’s Office is requiring that the strip of right-of-way described below to be vacated. \n                     \nThe following ordinance allows the City to vacate the following rights-of-way: an 8 foot alley in Wooley’s Addition, being a 1,000 square foot (0.023 acre +/-) portion of the first alley north of Camden Avenue and east of St. Clair Avenue.  Vacating this area of the right-of-way will allow the applicant to clear title and incorporate it into the surrounding parcel, to then be combined into one parcel.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by vacating this portion of right-of-way.\n \nThe Department of Public Service has agreed to vacate this strip of right-of-way as described and shown within the attached legal description and extinguish its need for public right-of-way. \n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT \nNo funding is required by this legislation.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION  \nEmergency action is requested by the Department of Public Service to allow this redevelopment project to proceed without unnecessary delay, which will preserve the public peace, health, property, safety and welfare.\n \nTitle\nTo vacate an unnamed 8 foot alley in Wooley’s Addition north of Camden Avenue and east of St. Clair Avenue; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Camden Land Holdings, LLC asking that the City transfer all of the 8 foot alley from the original easterly Right-of-Way line of St. Clair Avenue to the extension of the westerly line of the first 15 ft alley east of said St. Clair Avenue, originally dedicated and subsequently vacated in Wooley’s Addition as numbered and delineated in Plat Book 4 page 173, Franklin County Recorder’s Office, said alley being described in a boundary survey of 1,000 square foot (0.023 acre +/-); and  \n \nWHEREAS, the following rights-of-way will be vacated:  an 8 foot alley in Wooley’s Addition, being a 1,000 square foot (0.023 acre +/-) portion of the first alley north of Camden Avenue and east of St. Clair Avenue; and\n \nWHEREAS, vacating this area of the right-of-way will allow the applicant to incorporate it into the surrounding parcel, to then be combined into one parcel; and \n \nWHEREAS, per current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by vacating this portion of right-of-way; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to vacate the referenced right-of-way to allow this redevelopment project to proceed without unnecessary delay, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.   That by Council passing this ordinance it does hereby vacate all of the 8 foot alley from the original easterly ROW line of St. Clair Avenue to the extension of the westerly line of the first 15 ft alley east of said St. Clair Avenue, originally dedicated and subsequently vacated in Ord.
