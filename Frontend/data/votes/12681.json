    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nTo make sure our children are ready for kindergarten, the Office of Education uses different tools and collaborates with certain organizations in the preparation of our children. As part of the 2025-2026 Early Start Columbus Program, Future Ready Five will provide comprehensive early literacy assessment, data-driven intervention, instructional support, and parent engagement to approximately 380 4-year old children enrolled at several Columbus Early Learning Center locations as part of the expanded Kindergarten Readiness Collaborative. This transition supports a more integrated, outcomes-based model of early childhood education.\n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests permission to contract for $130,000.00 with Future Ready Five to provide this crucial work.\n \nThis contract is being awarded pursuant to Columbus City Code Section 329.30, which allows for the city to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts. The Office of Education chose Future Ready Five because there is no employee expertly positioned to do this work in the city. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract ($130,000.00) is available within the 2025 Office of Education General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract with Future Ready Five to provide comprehensive early literacy assessment, data-driven intervention, instructional support, and parent engagement to approximately 380 4-year old children; and to authorize the expenditure of $130,000.00 from the General Fund.
