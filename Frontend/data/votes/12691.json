    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Travco Construction, Inc. for the Lead Service Line Replacements - Pilot Program, 690236-100178, to apply for a grant award from the H2Ohio Fund, to accept the H2Ohio Fund grant if awarded, to appropriate and expend grant funds in accordance with the conditions of the grant awards, to authorize the execution of agreements in connection with the application for the grants and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant period.\n \nThe H2Ohio Fund grant award will be utilized for the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water, Childcare Facility Lead Service Line Replacement project, in an amount up to $500,000.00.  This grant will be used for the removal and replacement of lead and galvanized service lines at designated Childcare Facilities within the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities Water Service Area.  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU) Division of Water serves approximately 1.4 million people in Central Ohio. This includes the City of Columbus and 24 surrounding communities through full-service contract agreements.  DPU is in compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) and is currently building processes to ensure we are in compliance with the recently finalized Lead and Copper Rule Improvements.  DPU has prohibited the installation of lead or galvanized service line materials since 1964.  \n \nIn preparation for the removal of all lead and galvanized service lines within our water system, DPU established its Lead Service Line Replacement (LSLR) Program in 2024 through the enactment of Columbus City Code Chapter 1119. This code gives DPU the authority to find and replace lead and galvanized service lines on private property, as well as enforce the requirement for replacement if necessary. As part of our newly established LSLR Program schools and daycares will receive priority attention for replacement due to the vulnerable population they serve.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nAn H2Ohio Fund grant from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) will be used to fund this contract.  This grant will be set-up under Fund 6013, Water Grants Fund, Grant G602500 (Childcare Facility Lead Service Line Replacement project).  Funds will need to be appropriated.  \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance so water lines containing lead and/or galvanized material may be identified and remedied as soon as possible, eliminating this public health hazard.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Travco Construction, Inc. for the Lead Service Line Replacements - Pilot Program, to apply for an H2Ohio Fund grant;
