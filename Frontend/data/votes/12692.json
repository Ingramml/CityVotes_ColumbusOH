BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Hazen and Sawyer for the Overall Engineering Consultant (OEC) 2022-2024, CIP #650025-100001, in an amount up to $590,000.00.\n \nThis Engineering Agreement is necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the City and its design professionals in planning and coordination of the work. This work is part of the City’s continuing program to improve its sewer collection system and all related infrastructure, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety.  The OEC services are separated into several tasks, as follows:\n \n                     Task 1 - Planning Services\n                     Task 2 - Design Services\n                     Task 3 - Construction Related Services\n                     Task 4 - General and Additional Services\n                     Task 5 - Project Management\n \nThe City will request a task order from the consultant as necessary work is identified.  The task order will include a detailed scope of work, direct and indirect costs, task schedule, estimated hours, personal categories required with labor rates, and reimbursable expenses.  After negotiation and upon acceptance by the City, the consultant shall commence with said work.  The Engineer shall provide such professional engineering services as may be necessary to accomplish the work required to be performed and shall at the firm’s cost, furnish all necessary competent personnel, equipment, and materials to perform the work.\n \nThis serves multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $590,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                      $300,000.00 (ORD 0226-2022 PO317358)\nModification #1 Amount:                                                        $300,000.00 (ORD 1885-2023 PO405258)\nModification #2 Amount                                               $590,000.00 (Current)\nTotal (Orig. + Modification/Modification):                                $1,190,000.00\n \n1.2.

How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the existing contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project provides many metrics on various environmental factors that are noted in the work to be performed.  The information provided assists and guides the City in decision making on environmental issues.  These decisions have a direct impact on the capital improvement program budget amounts and scheduling to address the environmental needs.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nHazen and Sawyer’s contract compliance number is CC000630 and expires 2/27/26.\n \nHazen and Sawyer plans to do the work on this contract with the use of the following sub-consultants:\n \nCompany Name                                               City/State                                     ODI Certification Status  \nColdwater Consulting, LLC.                             Columbus, Ohio                                           WBE\nDonovan Utility Consulting Services, LLC         Hamilton, Ohio                                            MAJ\nStantec Consulting Services, Inc.                      Columbus, Ohio                                           MAJ\nJacobs Engineering Group Inc.                         Columbus, Ohio                                            MAJ \nBlue Heron Engineering Services Ltd.               Dublin, Ohio                                                WBE\n \nThe certification of Hazen and Sawyer and all sub-consultants was in good standing at the time of this modification.\n \n4.
