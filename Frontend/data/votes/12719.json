    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis ordinance will authorize the City Auditor to enter into an agreement for professional auditing services with Rea & Associates, Inc. for the calendar year 2025, for the City of Columbus and the Office of the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk, and to authorize the expenditure of up to $352,000.00.\n \nAll political subdivisions of Ohio are required to be audited by the Auditor of the State of Ohio or his designee (AOS).  The United States Office of Management and Budget through the Single Audit Act of 1996, as amended, has made it possible for all federal grants to be audited via one comprehensive audit. \n \nPursuant to Section 117.09 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC), the AOS is responsible for audits of all public offices.  For the three years prior to 2025, the AOS office performed the audit services of the City.  Beginning with 2025, the AOS and the City of Columbus Auditor have concurred that the most appropriate way to meet such requirement is to engage an independent public accounting firm (IPA) to conduct an independent audit of the City's accounting records and those of the Office of the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk including federal and state grants. \n \nThe AOS office oversees a competitive process for selecting IPAs to perform government audits on behalf of their office.  In June 2025, the City of Columbus completed the AOS competitive bidding process.  Rea & Associates, Inc. was selected through this competitive bidding process.   The audit agreement covers five years (2025-2029), with each year being subject to the authorizing appropriation of Council.  This ordinance represents the first year of this five-year cycle. This ordinance also requests a waiver of the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code Section 329 as the procurement and selection process is dictated by ORC and the Auditor of State. \n \nContract Compliance:\nRea & Associates, Inc. contract compliance no. is CC-049856 and is valid through July 18, 2026.\n \nFiscal Impact:\nFunds ($352,000.00) were specifically budgeted for this expenditure in the City Auditor's operating budget.\n \nEmergency Action:\nEmergency action is requested to provide uninterrupted audit service, allowing Rea & Associates, Inc. to meet requirements for a timely audit, ensuring that the City not be delayed in issuing its Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR), and meeting all deadlines for prompt financial reporting, a key component in the City’s credit ratings and essential to providing timely and transparent financials to all stakeholders.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to enter into an agreement along with the Auditor of the State of Ohio, and Rea & Associates, Inc., for professional auditing services for calendar year 2025; to waive the relevant competitive bidding provisions Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of up to $352,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
