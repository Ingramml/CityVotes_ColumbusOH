    "description": "Explanation \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe following ordinance authorizes the City Attorney's Office, Real Estate Division to hire professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) and to negotiate with property owners to acquire the various property rights necessary to complete the Roadway - Livingston Avenue - 18th Street to Nelson Road project in the Citywide Planning Area (62).\n \nThe Department of Public service is engaged in the Roadway - Livingston Avenue - 18th Street to Nelson Road project.  This project is a result of a safety study initiated by the City that included public engagement with a steering committee made up of community members. The resulting recommendation is to perform a lane reallocation to reduce the travel lanes and provide improvements that will increase safety for all users.                     \n \nThe cost to acquire the rights-of-way needed to complete the project is estimated at $1,000,000.00.  If the cost to acquire the needed rights-of-way should exceed this estimate, additional legislation will be submitted to Council requesting the needed funding. \n \nThe Department of Public Service is currently finalizing construction plans and is prepared to authorize rights-of-way acquisition pending passage of this funding legislation.\n \nOrdinance 2862-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to formally apply for a Safe Streets and Road for All Grant for the Livingston Avenue corridor between 18th Street and Nelson Road.  The City was successful and received an award of $12,000,000.00 to complete the construction portion of the project.  The award stipulates that the project must be completed five years from the time the grant agreement is executed.  In order to meet this timeline, design of the project must be expedited, necessitating the need for an emergency legislation request.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amounts of $1,000,000.00 are budgeted and available for this project in Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  A transfer of funds is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned project expenditure. Funds are appropriated. \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner to prevent delays in the project schedule and meet deadlines for leveraged grant funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the City Attorney's Office, Real Estate Division, to contract for professional services relative to the acquisition of fee simple title and lesser interests in and to property needed for the Roadway - Livingston Avenue - 18th Street to Nelson Road project; to authorize the City Attorney's Office, Real Estate Division, to negotiate with property owners to acquire the additional rights of way necessary to complete this project; and to authorize the expenditure of $1,000,000.00 from the Streets & Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
