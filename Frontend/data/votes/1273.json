    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with R.W. Setterlin Building Company for the renovation of the Police and Fire Joint Administrative Building at 1185 East Broad Street. \nThe purpose of the Police and Fire Joint Safety Administrative Building project is to renovate an approximately 13,000 square-foot 2-story facility that will be utilized as office, conference room, and workstation space for both the Police and Fire Divisions. Currently, the Division of Police and the Division of Fire's administrative functions are operated out of a leased facility. By renovating an existing property, the Department of Safety will be able to more efficiently coordinate administrative functions and the City will have added flexibility in terms of workspace configuration and will also be able to lower future operating costs by avoiding the need to budget for lease payments. The scope of work includes but is not limited to, construction of new mechanicals, electrical, and plumbing (\"MEP\"), revitalization of the façade, hazardous material remediation, interior and site security, as well as modernization of the fire alarm system, technology infrastructure, and elevator system. This project will also include renovation work related to landscaping, roof repair/replacement, perimeter drainage, furniture/fixtures/equipment (\"FFE\"), and signage.\nFormal bids were solicited and the City received three (3) bids (0 FBE, 0 MBE) on May 18, 2021 as follows: \n\n\n\nCompany\n\nCity\n\nFBE/MBE\n\nAmount of Bid\n\n\n\nAltman  General Contractors\n\nColumbus\n\nEBOCC\n\nWithdrawn \n\n\n\nR.W Setterlin Building  Company\n\nColumbus\n\nEBOCC\n\n$6,172,069.00\n\n\n\nElford, Inc. \n\nColumbus\n\nEBOCC\n\n$6,461,000.00\n\n\n \nAltman General Contractors had a low base bid of $5,781,000.00.
