    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with American Structurepoint, Inc. to add additional funds for the Roadway - SR161 - Busch Boulevard to Ambleside Drive project.  \nOrdinance No. 3241-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with American Structurepoint, Inc. for the Roadway - SR161 - Busch Boulevard to Ambleside Drive project.   The intent of this project is multi phased improvements to safety and multi-modal access throughout the East Dublin-Granville Road/State Route 161 (SR161) corridor. This phase is the third phase targeted for the Dublin-Granville Road/SR161 corridor between I-71 and Cleveland Avenue. This phase will provide improvements to SR161 from North Meadows Boulevard/Busch Boulevard to Ambleside Drive/Satinwood Drive. The side streets of Ambleside Drive/Satinwood Drive, Roche Drive, and North Meadows Boulevard will be improved and will include the addition of pedestrian and bike facilities, new traffic signals, pavement improvements, raised medians on the side streets, and the installation of two mini-roundabouts and one full size roundabout.  The SUP limits will be from North Meadows Boulevard to Ambleside Drive/Satinwood Drive.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,100,000.00 for additional professional services to complete the detailed design of the project. \n \nOrdinance 2534-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission relative to the MORPC Attributable Funds Program, accept and expend awarded grant funds, and issue refunds, if necessary, for the Roadway - SR161 - Busch Boulevard to Ambleside Drive project.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $1,100,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $600,000.00     (PO424505,   Ord. 3241-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,100,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $1,700,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to continue the project  through the third phase of the detailed design which was not included in the original fee.  The amount initially legislated for this project did not include the full amount that would be needed to fund this project through the detailed design stages.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis work is within the project limits of the original contract. It would be redundant to have a separate contract to perform this work. It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against American Structurepoint, Inc. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for American Structurepoint, Inc. is CC007019 and expires 06/10/2027.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,100,000.00 is budgeted, available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to keep the project on schedule and meet the MORPC funding dates to preserve the safety of the traveling public.\n                     \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with American Structurepoint, Inc. in connection with the Roadway - SR161 - Busch Boulevard to Ambleside Drive project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to pay for the project; and to declare an emergency.
