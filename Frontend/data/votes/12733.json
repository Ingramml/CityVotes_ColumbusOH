    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center, a non-profit corporation, in support of its Family Services program Choice Food Pantry.  \n \nThe mission of Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center (CRC) is to deliver responsive services, cultivate partnerships, and promote opportunities to foster a healthier community.  To that end, the Family Services program Choice Food Pantry is working every day to provide food to families who are impacted by food insecurity. In addition to alleviating food insecurity, families who access the food pantry are able to link with a social worker to sign up for food stamps, Medicaid, and other benefits for which they may be eligible. Families can also access diapers, baby formula, personal hygiene items, and clothing from the food pantry. CRC has a Housing Resource Specialist located at the food pantry, focused primarily on families who have been at imminent risk of eviction.  Funding will be used to pay for staff time at the food pantry to continue to meet the growing need during times of shrinking funding available. CRC serves a high volume of immigrant/refugee families, families experiencing housing instability, older adults, and the unhoused. Our community relies on us as a safety net and CRC is requesting funding to continue to provide these life-saving services to the community.\n \nThis funding will help allow for continued operation of this program, and City Council is proposing $15,000.00 for this purpose.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $15,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is requested in order for Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center to ensure no interruption to food pantry operations.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center in support of its Family Services program Choice Food Pantry; to authorize an appropriation of $7,500.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the expenditure of $15,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency ($15,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is need to provide support and resources to our city’s families who are impacted by food insecurity; and\n \nWHEREAS, the mission of Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center (CRC) is to deliver responsive services, cultivate partnerships, and promote opportunities to foster a healthier community; and\n \nWHEREAS, the organization runs the Family Services program Choice Food Pantry to provide for these needs; and \n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing support of $15,000.00 in support of these programs; and\n \nWHEREAS, $15,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is necessary for the Clerk to enter into a contract immediately with Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center to sustain the current operations in effect, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
