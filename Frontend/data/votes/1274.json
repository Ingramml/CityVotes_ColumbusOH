    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Public Safety Director to modify the existing contract with U S Corrections LLC, DBA Prisoner Transport Services. This modification seeks to increase additional funds needed for transportation services. This service allows the Division of Police to extradite fugitives back to Columbus that are entered into the LEADS system.  This company is the only vendor found to be able to extradite individuals from all over the Country.  The Wellness Bureau has looked into additional vendors but have only found vendors who would work regionally, thus requiring several contracts to cover the Country. Therefore, a bid waiver has been requested to deem this service as manifestly impractical to bid.\n \nContract Compliance - CC035197, and are in the process of renewing.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $35,000.00 from the General Fund for prisoner transport services, to return fugitives to Columbus.  The total amount spent on this service in 2020 was $40,000.00.  The total amount spent on this in 2019 was $35,000.00. And finally, the total amount spent on this system in 2018 was $25,000.00. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Public Safety Director to enter into contract modification with U S Corrections LLC for the transportation of fugitives back to Columbus; to waive competitive bidding requirements of City Code; and to authorize the expenditure of $35,000.00 from the General Fund. ($35,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the division has a need to extradite fugitives as they often leave the area and are arrested in other parts of the country.  They are then held for extradition back to Columbus; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the vendor has been found to have the necessary experience and expertise to provide said service; therefore, it is in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the City Code to enter into this modification; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance seeks to modify the existing contract and increase the funds for the recovery of fugitives that have been held by other jurisdictions; and,\n \nWHEREAS, funds of $35,000.00 are available for this contract modification in the 2021 General Fund budget; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Police, Department of Public Safety, to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into contract modification with U S Corrections LLC for the extradition of fugitives, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Public Safety Director be and is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a contract modification with U S Corrections LLC for services of extradition of fugitives back to Columbus, Ohio\n \nSECTION 2.
