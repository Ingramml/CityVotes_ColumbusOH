    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance Director to enter into a non-profit service contract with Impact Community Action to implement the Empowered! program and support energy efficient, sustainable neighborhoods in line with the City’s Columbus Climate Action Plan. Empowered! is a clean-energy jobs program geared toward Columbus residents ages 18-24. The program will provide training and on-the-job experience for careers in the clean-energy sector and focus on recruiting participants from communities of color and women in Opportunity Neighborhoods to assure community-wide awareness of the programming which is open to all. These services cannot be provided by current city employees.\n \nFunding will support three cohorts of program participants over the next year, providing training to establish the skills and knowledge needed to be a competitive candidate for full-time employment within the clean-energy sector. Training will also highlight career exploration; digital literacy; diversity, equity and inclusion; and wraparound services. Additionally, all participants will receive Customer Service Credential, NCCER Core, and OSHA 10 certifications upon program completion.\n \nFurthermore, Empowered! participants will receive on-the-job experience as Energy Advocates, helping residents navigate and better understand energy efficiency and the range of energy programs available to them. They will also perform low-level energy audits and simple energy upgrades such as LED-bulb replacement. Participants will be paid $17 per hour as Energy Advocates and receive compensation for their training.  \n \nUpon completion of the program, Empowered! graduates will be placed in pre-apprenticeships or apprenticeships, or directly employed in fields such as weatherization, construction, utilities, solar installation and manufacturing. The Empowered! Program will advance both the Columbus Climate Action Plan and environmental justice by supporting those communities most impacted by climate change. This program is anticipated to serve 75 youth participants.\n \nThe funding also includes support for energy-efficient appliance upgrades for traditional Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) participants (below 200% of the Federal Poverty Line). This program has previously served over 180 households, a majority of which are black female-headed households and is anticipated to assist over 300 households with new energy efficient appliances. Appliances include refrigerators, stoves, freezers and washers and dryers.\n \nThis contract will include program expenses beginning January 1, 2025.\nImpact Community Action, FID 205536173, CC#CC001447\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an appropriation and expenditure of $2,009,922.00 from the Sustainable Columbus Fund to Impact Community Action for implementation of the Empowered!
