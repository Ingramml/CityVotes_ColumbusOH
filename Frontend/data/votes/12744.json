    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a Professional Engineering Services contract with CDM Smith, Inc, via the City’s Request for Proposal process for the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP) Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) Improvements, CIP #690618-100000, in an amount up to $2,999,857.30.\n \nThis project is necessary to facilitate the installation of GAC facilities at the City’s DRWP surface water treatment plant. The current DRWP treatment process is not able to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  Treatment capability is needed to consistently meet the PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation.  GAC is a proven technology for PFAS removal.  Adding GAC will also help position the DRWP to meet other potential future regulatory requirements and improve public health protection.\n \nThe GAC improvements shall improve public health for our customers, serve all intentions of their planned operation, provide flexibility and ease of operation, and shall be completed while maintaining the treatment efficacy, hydraulic, and production capacity of DRWP.\n \nThis contract tasks include, but not be limited to, inspections and evaluations of existing conditions, alternatives analysis, conceptual design, negotiations with the authorities having jurisdiction, preparation of a preliminary design and report for the GAC improvements, and other services as captured in the contract. \n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be “99” Citywide.  \n \nTIMELINE:  The Notice to Proceed for the initial contract is anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2025 with completion of the Preliminary Design Report in the third quarter of 2026.  The City may elect to issue a contract modification for Detailed Design. If executed, detailed design is anticipated to begin the third quarter of 2026 and is anticipated to be completed in 2027. The City may elect to issue at least two contract modifications for Engineering Services During Construction. Project completion is anticipated in 2032.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The initial contract is being authorized in the amount of $2,999,857.30.  Planned modifications to add funds are anticipated.  The estimated cost of the contract is provided below.\n \nCost summary: \n                     Initial Contract                                                                                                         $  2,999,857.30\n                     Future Renewal #1 (future)                                                               $10,000,000.00\n                     Future Renewal #2 (future)                                                               $  8,000,000.00\n                     Future Renewal #3 (future)                                                               $  8,000,000.00\n                             CONTRACT TOTAL                                                               $28,999,857.30\n \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project is to facilitate the installation of GAC facilities at the City’s DRWP surface water treatment plant. The current DRWP treatment process is not able to remove PFAS compounds and additional treatment capability is needed to consistently meet the proposed finished water regulatory requirements for PFAS.  GAC is a proven technology for PFAS removal.  Adding GAC will also help position the DRWP to meet other potential future regulatory requirements and improve public health protection. Water quality provided by the City is essential to human health and economic growth and development.\n \nThere were no public meetings held regarding this work. DRWP is a secure facility and is not a publicly accessible facility.    \n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nA Request for Proposals for the DRWP GAC Improvement project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from 02/28/25 through 04/04/25.  Three proposals were received for the project and were opened on 4/4/25.  The following companies submitted proposals:\n  \nCompany                                                                 City/State                                           Compliance Number                                           ODI Status\nCDM Smith, Inc                                          Columbus/OH                                                   CC000180                                                 MAJ\nBlack & Veatch                                           Columbus/OH                                                   CC008038                                               MAJ\nAECOM                                                                  Columbus/OH                                                   CC010897                                               MAJ\n \nThe evaluation committee reviewed the proposals and recommended the contract for the DRWP GAC Improvement project be awarded to CDM Smith, Inc. \n \nThe certification of CDM Smith, Inc was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nCDM Smith, Inc’s contract compliance number is CC000180 and expires 10/2/2026.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CDM Smith, Inc \n \nCDM Smith, Inc listed the following companies as sub-consultants for this project:\n \nCompany Name                                                                City/State                                                                ODI Certification Status\nJacobs                                                                                                         Columbus/OH                                                                                    MAJ\nDynotec                                                                                    Columbus/OH                                                                                    MBE\nResource International, Inc.                                          Columbus/OH                                                                                    WBE\nOsborn Engineering                                                               Columbus/OH                                                                                    MAJ\nDonahue Ideas                                                                                    Columbus/OH                                                                                    WBE\nCTL Engineering                                                               Columbus/OH                                                                                    MBE\n \nThe certification of CDM Smith, Inc and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 0859-2024, passed by Council on April 15, 2024.  The loan is expected to be approved in June, 2025.\n \nThis project is contingent on the WSRLA loan being approved by the OWDA Board.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.  It is necessary to appropriate funds in the amount of $2,999,857.30 in Fund 6011 (Water Supply Revolving Loan Fund) for the DOW loan portion of this project. \n  \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with CDM Smith, Inc for Professional Construction Management Services for the DRWP GAC Improvement project; to appropriate funds in the Water Supply Revolving Loan Fund; to make this ordinance contingent upon the Ohio Water Development Authority approving a loan for this project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,999,857.30 from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Fund to pay for the project.
