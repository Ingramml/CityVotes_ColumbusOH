    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction modification contract with Travco Construction, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Travco) for the Lead Service Line Replacement - Pilot Program project, CIP #690236-100178, in an amount up to $1,000,000.00.   \n \nThe scope of work for the contract modification is not changing.  The contractors will continue to provide the necessary labor and equipment to complete the Lead Service Line Replacement - Pilot Program project.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 Citywide.\n \n1.1  TIMELINE:  The original project timeline is still in effect.  All work shall be complete within 730 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The City issued a Notice to Proceed July 17, 2024. \n \n1.2 ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed awarded amount was $2,500,000.00, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work. \n \nModification No. 1 is being proposed as part of this current legislation request.  The modification is for $1,000,000.00.\n \nCost summary: \nOriginal Contract (ORD 1648-2024, PO461754, PO461769)                      $     2,500,000.00\nH2Ohio Grant (ORD 1693-2025)                                                                                    $        500,000.00\nModification No. 1 (Current)                                                                                    $     1,000,000.00\n        TOTAL                                                                                                                $     4,000,000.00\n                     \nThis modification was unplanned, but considered beneficial to the City to permit the contractor to continue removing lead from the distribution system.  No future modifications are anticipated \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nDue to the significance of getting lead service lines out of the distribution system, and due to the timing of setting up a new contract, it is critical to have these additional funds added to the original contract.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe additional funds provided for the project will permit the contractor to continue replacing lead or galvanized taps and private service lines.  This will assist the Division of Water in meeting OEPA requirements regarding lead.  This work will be performed on an “as-needed” basis at miscellaneous locations directed by the City, and will remain within the original scope of the contract.  Community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nTravco’s contract compliance number is CC009944 and expires 9/3/26.\n \nAs part of their bid, Travco proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nDecker Construction Company                     Columbus, OH                                       MAJ\nBiz Tech DBA Tatum Landscaping              Columbus, OH                                       MBE\n & Lawncare LLC\nCLB Trucking, Inc.                                      Columbus, OH                                      MBE\n \nThe certification of Travco and the above companies was in good standing at the time the of this contract modification.\n \n4. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nTravco and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for the construction modification services contract ($1,000,000.00) will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the August Board meeting.  Funds will need to be certified against the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to proceed with this project until the loan has been approved.  \n \nFunds will need to be appropriated within the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, transferred to the Water - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, and then appropriated in the Water - Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, in the amount of $1,000,000.00 is needed to fund construction for this project.  \n \nThis transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  An amendment to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Travco for this contract.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Travco and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.
