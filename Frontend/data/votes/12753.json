Coordinate and participate in educational programs to promote equal treatment, opportunity, and understanding of persons within the LGBTQ+ community and facilitate gatherings such as meetings, institutes, fora, or courses of instruction designed to lead to greater understanding and crafting of\nsolutions for matters concerning the LGBTQ+ community.\n \nTitle\nTo enact Chapter 179 of the Columbus City Codes to establish the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) Affairs Commission.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) community have demonstrated intrinsic value and immeasurable contributions to the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law's Williams Institute estimates that 4.3% of people in Ohio identify as LGBTQ+; and\n \nWHEREAS, according to The Trevor Project's 2024 U.S. National Survey of the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People, \"90% of LGBTQ+ young people said their wellbeing was negatively impacted due to recent politics;\" and\n \nWHEREAS, nearly half of the National Institutes of Health grants canceled through early May of this year (totaling over $800 million) addressed the health of sexual and gender minority groups according to the New York Times; and\n \nWHEREAS, Out Leadership, a global LGBTQ+ business platform, ranked Ohio as 39th out of 50 states\nwith regard to gay and trans safety; and\n \nWHEREAS, the LGBTQ+ community is under persistent attack by the Ohio General Assembly, where various bills have been drafted and some even enacted to restrict the lives and safety of such community members, including House Bill 8 which requires teachers to notify parents of their child's gender identity and House Bill 190 which requires parental permission for a child to change their name and pronouns; and\n \nWHEREAS, as Utah Governor Spencer Cox wrote in 2022 in response to the Utah state legislature's attacks on trans youth in sports, \"Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few...I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce\nsuicidality significantly;\" and\n \nWHEREAS, residents and elected officials will benefit from formalizing a structure to solicit feedback and input from the LGBTQ+ community; NOW, THEREFORE;\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
