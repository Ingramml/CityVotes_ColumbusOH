    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend section 111.01 of the Columbus City Codes, pertaining to Council holding public meetings virtually, in-person, or a combination of the two.  \n \nIn July 2022, the decennial Columbus Charter Review Commission recommended a charter amendment that would allow Council to conduct virtual meetings.  Council placed this recommended amendment on the November 2022 ballot, when it was passed overwhelmingly by Columbus residents.  Council then effectuated this charter change with an amendment to the City Codes that establishes how Council may allow for virtual meetings, including allowing Council to hold meetings & hearings in-person, virtually, or a combination of the two, establishing the means by which Council may hold virtual meetings & hearings, and establishing that such meetings and hearings are conducted in such a way as to ensure that members of the public are able to observe and hear the public discussions and deliberations of all the members of Council, whether members are attending in-person or virtually.\n \nCouncil has successfully engaged these provisions, until changes to open meetings laws changed statewide in April 2025 with an amendment to the Ohio Revised Code.  The Ohio General Assembly enacted more restrictive statutes that, among other changes, restricted what matters could be acted upon at public meetings held virtually.  Now Council is proposing this amendment to restore the same rules and flexibility that it had prior to April 2025, which allowed for the Council to decide the date, time, manner, and location of its public meetings, and keeps the same safeguards for transparency and public safety.  The amendment also does the following:\n \n•                     Restores Council’s flexibility to decide the date, time, manner, and location of public meetings, including those held virtually, in-person, or a combination of the two\n•                     Allows Council to continue to consider all matters typically discussed and acted upon at regular, special, and committee meetings and hearings held virtually\n•                     Details use of executive session by Council, as governed by the Ohio Revised Code\n \nThis amendment will give Council the continued flexibility to conduct the business of the City, while also remaining accountable and accessible to all City residents.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This code amendment has an emergency designation, as it is necessary for Council to immediately restore the previous provisions passed by an overwhelming majority of voters and enacted by Council, as current state law can affect Council’s ability to conduct the business of the City.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend section 111.01 of the Columbus City Codes, pertaining to the ability of Council to hold virtual meetings, to repeal existing section 111.01; and to declare an emergency. \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in November 2022, Columbus voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the City Charter to allow Council, by ordinance, to establish means by which to meet virtually; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council occasionally engaged in virtual meetings following the COVID pandemic, successfully conducting the business of the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, in April 2025, the Ohio General Assembly enacted more restrictive statutes that, among other changes, restricted what matters could be acted upon at public meetings held virtually; and\n \nWHEREAS, home rule allows for municipalities to establish their own rules in Charter and Code for how they conduct open meetings; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing amendments to section 111.01 of the Columbus City Codes that will restore the previous rules for virtual meetings and affirm Council’s right under Section 9 of the City Charter to establish these rules, while still remaining accountable and accessible to all City residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the current operation of Columbus City Council, in that it is immediately necessary to restore Council’s previous ability to decide the date, time, manner, and location of public meetings as an exercise of local self-governance; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That chapter 111 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended as follows:\n \nSee attachment\n \nSECTION 2.  That existing section 111.01 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3:  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
