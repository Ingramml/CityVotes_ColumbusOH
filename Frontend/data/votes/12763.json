    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend three (3) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Janitorial Supplies with Hillyard Inc , Carmens’s Distribution System Inc., and Key 4 Supply Inc., and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend three (3) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to obtain Janitorial Supplies  with Hillyard Inc , Carmens’s Distribution System Inc., and Key 4 Supply Inc.  Mops, brooms, deodorizers, and trash bags are used throughout City of Columbus facilities.  This modification is necessary to ensure a contract is available so that janitorial products can be purchased as needed for use by the City of Columbus.   \n \nThese contracts, PO273121 (Hillyard Inc.) and PO273047 (Carmens’s Distribution System Inc.), and PO273049 (Key 4 Supply Inc.) were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ017870, authorized under Ordinance Number 1047-2021 passed May 13, 2021, and will expire August 30, 2025.\n \nThere are no changes in the type of products being procured.  The original contracts were formally bid.  The original terms and conditions of the previous contracts remain in effect. The contracts will expire on August 30, 2025.  There isn’t enough time to do a formal bid process to award a new contract and the City cannot go without janitorial supplies, which are used throughout the City.  These items are needed to guarantee a reliable supply of janitorial materials for use throughout all of the Columbus Facilities to ensure the safety of the citizens of Columbus.  It is therefore imperative that the contracts be modified to allow for an extension through December 31, 2025 to ensure these products are readily available through these suppliers.\n \nPursuant to Section 329.09(a) of Columbus City Codes:\n(1) Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funding is necessary for this modification to extend.\n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A\n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: These items are needed to guarantee a reliable supply of janitorial materials for use throughout all of the Columbus Facilities to ensure the safety of the citizens of Columbus.  It is therefore imperative that the contracts be modified to allow for an extension through December 31, 2025 to ensure these products are readily available through these suppliers until a new contract award process can be completed.\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: N/A\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency because the current contracts expire August 30, 2025 and it is necessary for an uninterrupted supply of janitorial supplies that are needed throughout the City of Columbus.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is required to modify and extend the option contracts. The pricing for the products on these contracts remains the same. The City Agencies must set aside their own funding for its estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend three (3) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Janitorial Supplies with Hillyard Inc , Carmens’s Distribution System Inc., and Key 4 Supply Inc., and to declare an emergency. ($0.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into three (3) Universal Term Contracts for Janitorial Supplies for use by Citywide agencies; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing Universal Term Contracts with Hillyard Inc , Carmens’s Distribution System Inc., and Key 4 Supply Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify and extend three (3) Universal Term Contracts to maintain a continual supply of janitorial supplies, the current contracts for which expire on August 30, 2025, and time will not allow for a formal bid process and new contracts to be established prior to the current expirations, for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts to obtain Janitorial Supplies with Hillyard Inc , Carmens’s Distribution System Inc., and Key 4 Supply Inc. for a period of four (4) months, from August 30, 2025 up to and including December 31, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
