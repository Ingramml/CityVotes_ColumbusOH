    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to modify a professional services and software licensing contract with  Fast of Colorado, L.P. (FAST LP) for Tax Revenue system user experience improvements. \n \nOrdinance 0795-2025 authorized the City Auditor to renew and extend the contract through May 31, 2026 with Fast of Colorado, L.P. (FAST LP) for the licensing, maintenance, support, and services necessary for the management of the GENTAX system.  The Auditor’s Office utilizes this system to administer and collect the taxes processed by the Division of Income Tax. This includes the public facing Columbus Revenue Information Services Portal (CRISP) that provides for the online filing and payment of taxes by employers, corporations, individuals, short-term rental, and hotel/motel operators. \n \nAfter the most recent tax filing season, the City Auditor solicited feedback and identified where customers had the most challenges with using CRISP.  To address the top issues and to increase protection against account takeover attacks, new programming and features are needed. This modification appends new features that improve the signup process, adds new capabilities for secure Pass Key logon, and provides other complementary enhancements designed to simplify and expand the overall user experience. These system enhancements are intended to spur engagement and increase adoption of the online features by refining the way users interact with CRISP.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to modify the original contract in order to add funds to pay for the additional professional services for the Office of the City Auditor, Income Tax Division in the amount of $100,000.00 for making user experience improvements to the CRISP website and the GENTAX platform.   \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $100,000.00\n \n\n\n\nThe 2025 contract renewal amount\n\n$ 2,762,753.00 \n\n\n\nAmount of this modification\n\n$    100,000.00\n\n\n\nTotal Contract amount including this modification\n\n$ 2,862,753.00\n\n\n \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to provide additional funding to enhance the user experience when interacting with the CRISP.columbus.gov website operated by the Income Tax Division. The previous ordinance was submitted prior to the end of the individual taxpayer filing season, and time was needed to review and evaluate the most common questions, issues, and barriers taxpayers raised during this period.  This modification will allow systems to proceed to improve customer interactions prior to the next peak filing season.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe City currently works with Fast of Colorado, L.P. (FAST LP) for the Tax Revenue system.  This modification adds funds to improve CRISP for filing taxes and making payments online to the Income Tax Division.  It is in the best interest of the City to modify this contract.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is based on the pricing as defined in the original proposal.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nFast of Colorado, L.P. (FAST LP), D365 Vendor Account #: 031630\nContract compliance #CC-031630, Expiration date: 6/18/2027\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds of $100,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Auditor’s Bond Fund, Fund 7783.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to modify the contract with Fast of Colorado, L.P.
