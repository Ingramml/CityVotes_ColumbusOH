    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\n The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Munira Abdullahi, representative for the Muslim American Society Columbus Chapter asking that the City transfer them a 17950 square foot (0.412 acre) portion of the right-of-way near Northtowne Blvd.  The right-of-way area is north of Morse Road and west of Northtowne Boulevard, abutted by parcels 010-251073 and 010-245370 to the west, and 010-277812 to the east.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will allow the owner to meet parking requirements for a planned community center/mosque on the parcels to the east.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $44,865.00 was established.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on January 16, 2025.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Muslim American Society Columbus Chapter at the cost of $0.00 to them.\n                     \n2. FISCAL IMPACT\nThe Land Review Commission waived the cost, therefore, there is no fiscal impact to the City for transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \n3. Emergency DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested, due to the short construction season in Ohio. This will allow the deed to be recorded as soon as possible, so the County can combine the lots and issue parcel numbers, allowing the development to proceed, certified addresses to be issued, construction of proposed roads, homes/buildings to be built. Additionally, it will allow the inspection and Construction Agreement to be finalized with the City. All to preserve the safety of the traveling public. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of a 0.412 acre portion of right-of-way near Northtowne Blvd to the Muslim American Society Columbus Chapter; and to declare an emergency.
