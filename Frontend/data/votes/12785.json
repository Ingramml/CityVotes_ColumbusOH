    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) originating from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate up to $505,462.00 in grant monies to fund the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Grant Program for the period of July 1, 2025 through June 30, 2026. \n \nThe Office of Emergency Preparedness writes and maintains the Columbus Public Health Emergency Response Plan. This Plan contains over 50 planning annexes such as infectious disease response and environmental health hazard response and mitigation plans covering the Columbus and Worthington jurisdictions.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is funded by the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue. The program does require a match of 7.7% from the city, which is budgeted and available. ($505,462.00)\n \nEMERGENCY: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as it directly supports our ability to respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises, such as disease outbreaks. Without this funding, our community risks being underprepared, which jeopardizes public health and essential services; and to avoid forfeiture of the grant.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Department of Health for the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program in the amount of $505,462.00; to authorize the appropriation of $505,462.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes; to authorize acceptance of additional funds; and to declare an emergency.
