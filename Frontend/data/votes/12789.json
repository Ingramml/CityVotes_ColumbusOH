    "description": "Explanation\n \n“Odja” a canine that has been in service with the Division of Police’s Canine Unit for six years needs to be taken out of service.\n \n“Odja” is a 7 year old canine and his handler is retiring from the Division of Police after thirty-four years of service.  “Odja” has an obstinate temperament.  Re-training him with another handler is unadvisable and economically impractical due to his age, prior medical issues, and he is near the end of his service life.  Due to these facts it is in the best interest of “Odja” and the Division to take him out of service and retire him.  Retiring “Odja” would keep the Division from paying the additional cost for food and medical expenses with no guarantee that he would be able to perform necessary duties.  \n \nIt is recommended that “Odja” be retired and to permit his handler, Officer Brian Carter #1155, to assume custody and care of “Odja” and purchase him from the Division of Police for the sum of $1.00.(ORC 9.62, (C)).  Officer Brian Carter #1155 has agreed to accept “Odja”. \n \nAdditionally, the Division of Police Legal Bureau has developed a general release document that relinquishes the City of Columbus from any liability as it relates to the post retirement care and control of “Odja”, and assigns that liability to Officer Brian Carter #1155.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAt this time there is no fiscal impact. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to sell to Officer Brian Carter #1155, for the sum of $1.00, a police canine with the registered name of “Odja” which has no further value to the Division of Police and to waive the provisions of City Code- 329 Sale of City-owned personal property. ($1.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, “Odja” has been a Canine Unit canine with the Division of Police for six years; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is recommended “Odja” be retired due to his handler’s retirement. \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to allow this horse to be purchased by Officer Brian Carter #1155 for the sum of $1.00; now therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1. That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized and directed to sell the police canine with the registered name of “Odja” to Officer Brian Carter #1155 for the sum of $1.00.\n \nSection 2. That the Council of the City of Columbus finds it is in the best interests of the City that City Code 329 - Sale of City-owned personal property, be and is hereby waived to permit the sale of this specific canine to Officer Brian Carter #1155.\n \nSection 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
