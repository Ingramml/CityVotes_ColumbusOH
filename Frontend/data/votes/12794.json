    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City has been exploring the various legal options that may be available to help deal with the amount of money it spends on generic pharmaceutical drugs (hereinafter “generic drugs”), as a part of its health insurance coverage for employees.  Specifically, from February of 2020 until November of 2023, the City itself spent almost $106 million on generic drugs, including specialty generic drugs.  \n \nSeveral government entities have brought suit against certain manufacturers of generic drugs for price fixing.  The City Attorney’s office is in need of special legal counsel to assist in pursuing legal options, including but not limited to, possible litigation against these manufacturers.  After consideration, the City Attorney has selected the law firm of Grossman & Kelly LLP to serve as special legal counsel for this matter.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: While there is no cost to the City as a result of this contract, City Council approval is being sought due to the legally binding commitment being made therein to pay attorney fees and reimburse for reasonable litigation expenses solely on a contingency basis from any recovery related to the portion of any matter resolved in favor of the City.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to enter into contract with Grossman & Kelly LLP for special legal counsel services regarding price fixing issues related to generic drugs; and to declare an emergency.

That said contract shall provide that there shall be no obligation by the City to pay any fee to special legal counsel or reimburse them for reasonable litigation expenses if nothing is recovered from any adversary and that the City agrees to pay attorney fees and reimburse for reasonable litigation expenses solely on a contingency basis from any recovery related to the portion of any matter resolved in favor of the City.\n \nSection 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto which are hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and immediately after its passage and signature by the Mayor, or within 10 days thereafter if the Mayor neither signs nor vetoes the same.",
