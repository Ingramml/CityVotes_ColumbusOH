    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Geological Survey, United States Department of Interior, for the investigation of water resources in central Ohio, including groundwater and several rivers for the Division of Water and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage. The cooperative program of stream investigation and monitoring by the U.S. Geological Survey has been continued for several years.  It provides valuable water resource data to the City at a lower cost than providing such data by other means. The data form the scientific basis for decision making related to protection of life and property from water-related hazards, such as floods; cost-effective management of freshwater that is safe and available for drinking, industry, recreation, and ecosystem health; and local economic well-being.\n \nThe agreement will provide stream gauging, reservoir gauging and groundwater monitoring for the Division of Water and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage. The Division of Water and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage solicited a quotation from the U.S. Geological Survey in accordance with Section 329.30. This is a service that cannot be provided by existing city employees as this is a cooperative program provided by the U.S. Geological Survey.
