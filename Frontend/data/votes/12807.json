    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the provision of electrical energy to operate highway lighting and signs and for the maintenance of highway lighting.  \n \nODOT owns highway lights on Interstate Routes 270, 70, 71, 670 and a portion of State Route 315. Under the recently expired agreement, the city supplied, and ODOT purchased, electrical energy to operate certain highway lighting and signs, and the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Division of Power (DOP) provided routine and preventive maintenance for lights located on Interstate Routes 70, 71, 670 and portions of State Route 315. ODOT maintains the lights on Interstate Route 270. There are approximately 2,660 inside City limits and 320 outside City limits. \n \nThe term of this agreement will be for two years from date of execution through June 30, 2027. It may be renewed on a biennial basis. The authorizing ordinance for the recently lapsed agreement was ORD 1430-2020.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nODOT will pay DOP a flat rate of $41,489.99 per month for the purchase of electrical energy to operate roadway lights and signs on the State Highway System, as well as preventative maintenance payments of $5.54 per lamp per month for those inside City limits and $7.86 per lamp per month for those outside City limits. These maintenance payments will total approximately $17,250 per month, and along with the flat energy rate, contribute about $58,740.00 in monthly revenue to the Electricity Operating Fund.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to minimize the lapsed time between expiration of the 2nd amendment and execution of the new agreement. Negotiations with the Ohio Department of Transportation were not finalized until July 2nd. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, to allow the City's Division of Power to supply electrical energy for certain highway lighting and signs and to provide routine and preventative maintenance on highway lights; and to declare an emergency.
