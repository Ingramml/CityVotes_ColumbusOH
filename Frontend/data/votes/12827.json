    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the City Clerk to enter a grant agreement with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation dba Downtown Columbus, Inc. (DCI) (registered trade name of Columbus Downtown Development Corporation), a non-profit corporation, in support of open streets programming, which is currently scheduled to commence as early as August. Open streets programming is designed to temporarily close streets to vehicular traffic and demonstrate to people how the right-of-way can be reclaimed for activities like bicycling, walking, exercise, arts, and more.\n \nDCI is partnering with the Office of Councilmember Barroso de Padilla to host three events at various scales along High St. downtown. Two smaller events will occur from Long St. to Broad St. along High St., while the other event will be for a longer stretch of High St. to allow for more micro-mobility activations. These events are being coordinated with other partners like COTA to help educate people about how to de-center single occupant vehicles. Other initiatives like LinkUS and Bike Plus may also be featured.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018. Councilmember Barroso de Padilla has earmarked funds for open streets events this year.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter a grant agreement with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
