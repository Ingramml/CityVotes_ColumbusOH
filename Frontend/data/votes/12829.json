    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with City Year, Inc., a non-profit corporation, in support of its AmeriCorps Member Leadership and Professional Development Program.  \n \nCity Year, Inc. is seeking support for its AmeriCorps Member Leadership and Professional Development Program, a critical component of its Whole School Whole Child (WSWC) service model. This initiative prepares its corps of young adults, ages 18-25, to serve as full-time student success coaches in under-resourced Columbus City Schools, while equipping them with the professional skills, experiences, and support to thrive in future careers. Each year, City Year, Inc. recruits, trains, and supports approximately 40 AmeriCorps members. These young adults, the majority of whom identify as people of color and/or come from low- to moderate-income backgrounds themselves, receive over 300 hours of training in leadership, mentorship, data analysis, instructional best practices, conflict resolution, and career readiness. Throughout their service, members also engage in regular reflection, goal setting, coaching, and exposure to career pathways in education, nonprofit leadership, and other public and private service fields. This intentional investment ensures that members not only support student success in the short term but also develop as the next generation of civic leaders and changemakers. The professional development program directly benefits AmeriCorps members and indirectly supports almost 3,000 Columbus students they serve. \n \nCity Year, Inc. defines low- to moderate-income based on the percentage of students who qualify for free or reduced-price school meals as determined by Columbus City Schools. This metric aligns with federal income guidelines set by the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), which identifies students from households earning at or below 185% of the federal poverty level as eligible for meal assistance. While City Year does not collect individual income data from students or families, using the free and reduced-price lunch metric provides a reliable indicator of economic need within the schools it serves. Based on this measurement, 100% of the students served reside in low- to- moderate-income households and more than 80% identify as students of color, aligning strongly with the requirement that at least 51% of those ultimately served by this grant are low- to moderate-income individuals. By investing in AmeriCorps members’ growth, City Year, Inc. simultaneously increase the effectiveness of their impact in the classroom and expand workforce opportunities for young adults from under-served communities. This dual-impact approach builds a stronger, more community-engaged pipeline of future professionals, while driving immediate student success in neighborhoods furthest from opportunity. \n \nThis funding will benefit our students in need, and City Council is proposing $75,000.00 for this purpose.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $75,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is requested in order for City Year, Inc. to ensure time for training and preparation for the coming school year.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with City Year, Inc. in support of its AmeriCorps Member Leadership and Professional Development Program; to authorize an appropriation of $70,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the expenditure of $75,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency ($75,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is need to provide support and resources to students with economic need in the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Year, Inc. is seeking support for its AmeriCorps Member Leadership and Professional Development Program, which prepares its corps of young adults, ages 18-25, to serve as full-time student success coaches in under-resourced Columbus City Schools; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing support of $75,000.00 in support of the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, $75,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is necessary for the Clerk to enter into a grant agreement immediately with City Year, Inc. to ensure time for training and preparation for the coming school year, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with City Year, Inc. in support of its AmeriCorps Member Leadership and Professional Development Program.\n \nSECTION 2.
