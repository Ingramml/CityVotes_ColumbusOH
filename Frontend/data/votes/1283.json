Broad Street Widening Phase I project (P530103-100061) in the Far East Planning Area (58).\n \nThe Department of Public service is engaged in the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - E. Broad Street Widening project consisting of two phases.  The project’s two phases will widen East Broad Street from east of I-270 to Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road.  This legislation seeks to authorize expenditures to acquire various property rights for the first phase, which will construct new pavement for the widening and resurfacing of the existing pavement from the I-270 interchange to Outerbelt Street and will also include traffic signal improvements; addition of a shared use path, sidewalk, street lighting, street trees, signal interconnect conduit; and incidental improvements such as drainage, traffic control, sediment and erosion control, water adjustments, and maintenance of traffic.                                                                                                                              \n \nThe cost to acquire the right-of-way needed to complete the first phase of the project is estimated at $2,200,000.00.  If the cost to acquire the needed right-of-way should exceed this estimate, additional legislation will be submitted to Council requesting the needed funding. \n \nThe Department of Public service is currently finalizing construction plans and is prepared to authorize right-of-way acquisition pending passage of this funding legislation.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for the amount of $1,320,000.00 is available in the form of a grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation, which will partially fund right-of-way acquisition from the Federal Transportation Grants Fund, Fund 7765.  \n \nThrough the Department of Development, Public Service will contribute the local share for right-of-way acquisition, $880,000.00, from the E. Broad Commercial TIF Capital Fund, Fund 7431.  Funds are available in Project P431999-100000 and will need to be transferred to P530103-100061.  The funds will also need to be appropriated.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION \nEmergency action is requested to provide necessary right-of-way acquisition funding and prevent unnecessary delays in the Department of Public Service's Capital Improvement Program to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate $1,320,000.00 within the Federal Transportation Grants Fund; to transfer cash and appropriate funds within the East Broad Commercial TIF Capital Fund; to authorize the City Attorney's Office, Real Estate Division, to contract for professional services relative to the acquisition of fee simple title and lesser interests in and to property needed for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - E.
