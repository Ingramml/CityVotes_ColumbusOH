This contract provides for the parts, service, and maintenance of all access control products under the Frontier Security brand, including but not limited to badge readers, reader control modules, serial boards, reader distribution panels, Matrix subsystem gateways, door controllers, building controller items, and all associated connections. This agreement provides for the repair, replacement, and servicing of all accessible components and devices, panel and peripheral component replacements for the associated electronic systems, emergency service calls, and 24 hours a day, 7 days a week telephone support. \n \nSGI Matrix, LLC has installed all of the badge readers and has maintained the software, subsystem, and building controllers since the systems were installed at Department of Public Utilities facilities. SGI Matrix utilizes KNS Services as a subcontractor on the project to run cabling and place the equipment, but SGI Matrix, LLC will provide installation, final hook-up, testing, and programming of devices. \n \nDue to the proprietary nature of the security software and compatibility of existing security equipment, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into contract with SGI Matrix, LLC.\n \nThe original term of the contract will be for a period of one year, to and including June 30, 2026, with the option to renew annually contingent on funding availability, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of City Council, and certification of funds by the City Auditor. The contract does not automatically renew.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the initial term of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \nPrincipal Party:\n \nSGI Matrix LLC\n1041 Byers Road \nMiamisburg, OH 45342\nMatt Leitenberger, (937) 247-2867\nContract Compliance Number: 019553\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: PENDING UPDATE\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $34,450.50 is budgeted and available from within the Public Utilities Operating Funds to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n$31,139.00 was spent in 2024\n$37,161.82 was spent in 2023\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to avoid a lapse in provision of the necessary and vital security equipment and services provided under the contract.
