    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify by extending the contract term and increase funding for an existing service agreement with Aquatic Informatics, Inc. (DBA Tokay Software; previously known as Tokay Software, Inc.).  The existing contract will be extended for one additional year beyond the original term, for services for Backflow Prevention Management Software and additional funding in the amount of $48,000.00 is needed.  \n \nOn December 4, 2015, the Department of Public Utilities received one (1) proposal in response to an RFP for backflow prevention management software services. Aquatic Informatics, Inc. (DBA Tokay Software) was selected to provide this service. This contract is for approximately ten (10) years beginning on June 1, 2016 through February 28, 2026.
