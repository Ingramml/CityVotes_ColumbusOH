    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute a service contract with Routeware, Inc. for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection fleet.\n \nThe aforementioned project will allow the Division of Refuse Collection to maximize efficiencies and to assess streets for pot holes, illegal dumping, and other street maintenance, as the vehicles travel around their assigned routes.\n \nRouteware is an on-demand routing solution that will interface with existing routing software systems Lucity and GIS. The process enhances efficiencies for the Division of Refuse Collection creating a streamlined option to develop optimized bulk collection and container management routes each day. Drivers receive the routing instructions through iPhones leased by Routeware, Inc., and the routes are developed through an online portal that will pull in all relevant information for that day. The phones also allow the drivers to take before and after pictures to confirm service.\n \nThe department originally started using the Rubicon Global GPS tracking and route diagnostics in 2021 through a separate contract.  The original contracts and related modifications have since expired and it was determined that a new contract was needed to be established in order to continue utilizing services.  Routeware, Inc., the current provider of software for turn-by-turn directions and data collection for the Division of Refuse, acquired Rubicon in 2024.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Routeware, Inc. is CC030689 and expires September 1, 2027.  \n3.  BID WAIVER \nThe Department of Public Service is seeking Council approval under City Code Chapter 329 to waive competitive bidding to facilitate the execution of a service contract for proprietary software with Routeware, Inc. because there is an immediate need to create route efficiencies for the Division of Refuse Collections service routes, and to assist with identifying street maintenance issues and illegal dumping sites throughout the City of Columbus. This contract shall be for one (1) year with a renewal option of two (2) additional years, with a ten (10) percent price increase in Year Two and an additional ten (10) percent price increase in Year Three, dependent on approved budget appropriation.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $147,576.00 is available within Fund 1000, the Refuse Collection General fund, within the Department of Public Service.  \n5.  Emergency Justification\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the service contract so as not to delay the addition of needed route efficiencies, identifying street maintenance issues and illegal dumping sites, and cost savings therein.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute a service contract with Routeware, Inc. for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of up to $147,576.00 from the Refuse Collection General fund to pay for the contract; and to declare an emergency.  ($147,576.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute a contract with Routeware, Inc. for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection fleet; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $147,576.00 from the Division of Refuse Collection General Fund; and \n \nWHEREAS, the department originally started using the Rubicon Global GPS tracking and route diagnostics in 2021 through a separate contract; and\n \nWHEREAS,  the original contract and related modifications have since expired and it was determined that a new contract was needed to be established in order to continue utilizing services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 to facilitate the execution of the requisite service contract so as to facilitate the execution of a service contract with Routeware, Inc. because there is an immediate need to create route efficiencies for the Division of Refuse Collections service routes, and to assist with identifying street maintenance issues and illegal dumping sites throughout the City of Columbus; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with Routeware, Inc. in order to facilitate the execution of the service contract so as not to delay the addition of needed route efficiencies, identifying street maintenance issues and illegal dumping sites, and cost savings therein, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to execute a service contract with Routeware, Inc., 16575 SW 72nd Avenue, Portland, OR 97224, for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection fleet.\nSECTION 2.  That this Council has determined it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 and hereby waives said requirements.\nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $147,576.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (Refuse Collection General fund), Dept-Div 5902 (Division of Refuse Collection) the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 4.  That the funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
