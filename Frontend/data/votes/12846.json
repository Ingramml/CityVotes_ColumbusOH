    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Half Baked Holdings, LLC (the “Developer”) is redeveloping the former Kroger Bakery site at 427-515 Cleveland Avenue on Franklin County Parcel No. 010-015761 (the “Site”) into a mixed-use development consisting of an approximately 75,000 square-foot wellness club; 350 multi-family residential units; a parking garage containing 401 parking spaces; and an urban green space (collectively, the “Project”). Pursuant to Ordinance No. 0508-2021 passed on March 8, 2021 by City Council, the City entered the southern manufacturing building on a portion of the Site onto the Columbus Register of Historic Properties; that portion of the Site is also the former Ford Motor Company Branch Assembly Plant. City Council further passed Ordinance No. 3097-2015 on December 14, 2015 that declared improvements to certain parcels of real property to be a public purpose, established a non-school tax increment financing area pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.40(B) in the vicinity of the Milo-Grogan neighborhood (the “Milo-Grogan TIF”),and required the property owners within the Milo-Grogan TIF to make service payments in lieu of taxes for the same amounts as their property taxes as if the improvements to their parcels had not been exempted. The non-school portion of those service payments in lieu of taxes paid to the City for deposit into the public improvement tax increment equivalent fund (the “Milo-Grogan TIF Service Payments” ) are to be used to finance public infrastructure improvements benefiting the parcels in the Milo-Grogan TIF.  Ordinance No. 1988-2023 passed by City Council on July 24, 2023 expanded the Milo-Grogan TIF to include the Site and additional parcels. To further support the preservation of the now vacant, historical Site, and to repurpose it for the Project, City Council passed Ordinance No. 2093-2023 on July 31, 2023 to authorize the City to enter into the TIF Agreement dated September 8, 2023 (the “Prior TIF Agreement”) with the Developer, and to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of the Milo-Grogan TIF Service Payments to reimburse the Developer for the costs of certain public infrastructure improvements pursuant to that Prior TIF Agreement. \n \nAs the Prior TIF Agreement effectively expired since the Developer was unable to obtain a building permit and record a mortgage by December 31, 2024 due to tightening financial conditions in the private sector, the City and Developer desire to formally terminate the Prior TIF Agreement and enter into the new Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement (the “Cooperative Agreement”) with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (“the “CFCFA”). This Ordinance will authorize the City to enter into the Cooperative Agreement and a minimum service payment obligation declaration (the “Declaration”). This Ordinance will also appropriate and authorize the expenditure of the Milo-Grogan TIF Service Payments, minimum service payments, etc. to reimburse bonds issued by the CFCFA for the costs of certain public infrastructure improvements pursuant to that Cooperative Agreement and the Declaration and also authorize the appropriation and transfer of the Milo-Grogan TIF Service Payments, minimum service payments, etc. to the Housing Business Tax Incentive Fund for the retention of the City’s economic development fees. \n \nFiscal Impact: The City is appropriating and authorizing the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes (including property tax rollback payments) and minimum service payments deposited, and to be deposited, into the Milo-Grogan TIF Fund in accordance with the Cooperative Agreement and Declaration between the City, the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and Developer.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and transfer of $10,000.00 between the Milo-Grogan TIF Fund and the Housing Business Tax Incentive Fund; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $5,000.00 annually between the Milo-Grogan TIF Fund and the Housing Business Tax Incentive Fund during the term of the tax increment financing and cooperative agreement; to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes deposited, or to be deposited, into the Milo-Grogan TIF Fund to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority or its designee; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development, on behalf of the City, to enter into the new tax increment financing and cooperative agreement between the City, Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and Half Baked Holdings, LLC and the minimum service payment obligation declaration for reimbursement of bonds for certain public infrastructure improvements.
