    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc. for operational review and strategic planning consulting services. The consultant will continue a comprehensive operational review and assess different strategies for achieving the Department’s goals. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU) consists of its Director’s Office, which houses sections such as human resources, information technology and fiscal, among others, as well as the Divisions of Water, Sewerage and Drainage, Power and Stormwater. In total, DPU employs just over 1,400 full-time equivalent employees. The Department serves a population of approximately 1.2 million through the operation of three water and two waste water treatment plants and maintenance of approximately 3,600 miles of waterline and 4,600 miles of sewers. The Division of Power purchases and distributes power to approximately 18,500 customers and maintains approximately 59,000 streetlights. The Department’s 2025 operating budget, comprised of the enterprise funds for each of the four divisions, is over $850 million and it also has a 6-year capital improvement plan of over $3 billion. \n \nThis contract will supplement a previously agreed contract for operational review and strategic planning services. The first phase of this project included launching and managing the project, stakeholder engagement, and an effective utility management (EUM) 360 scan, which established a baseline of performance against various attributes of effective utility management. Phase two moved from the operational review to the strategic plan phase, and focused on tasks leading to its final development. The third phase continued the strategic plan development. As the project moves towards implementation, this new contract is a continuation of phase 3 and will also assess the optimal organizational design and structure for achieving DPU’s goals and objectives.\n \n \nPROCUREMENT:  \n \nThe original operational review and strategic planning project was formally advertised (RFQ023079) on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from October 6, 2022 to November 4, 2022 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code. The city received six (6) responses. All proposals were deemed responsive and were fully evaluated when the Evaluation Committee met on November 16, 2022. The committee recommended that the contract be awarded to Raftelis Financial Consultants Inc.\n \nThe original contract was for one year from the date of execution, with the option to renew for an additional two years on a year-to-year basis, or a portion thereof, based upon mutual agreement of the parties, availability of funding, and approval by Columbus City Council. The original authorizing ordinance was ordinance 3470-2022. A second ordinance, 1479-2023, authorized funding to cover phases 4-6. That ordinance, in error, did not extend the time period of the contract so it expired. As such, per Ordinance 0136-2024, it was deemed in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a contract with Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc. to provide funding for tasks 7-8 of the overall project. DPU desires to supplement the final phase of this project and explore alternative paths for implementation. Due to continuity from the prior phases, it is in the City’s best interest to waive competitive bidding provisions. \n \nThe term of this new agreement is for one-year from the date of execution with the option to renew for three additional one-year terms. Renewal options are permitted on an annual basis based upon mutual agreement of the parties, availability of funding, and approval by Columbus City Council.\n \n \nVENDOR:  \n \nRaftelis Financial Consultants, Inc. | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #011256 | Expires 3/12/2026 | \n \nSUBCONTRACTORS:\n \nHazen and Sawyer, P.C. | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #000630 | Expires 2/27/2026 | \n \nNeither the Contractor nor Subcontractor are debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$500,000.00 is budgeted and available for this contract.\n \n$39,789.52 has been spent year-to-date in 2025\n$151,913.37 was spent in 2024 \n$268,240.00 was spent in 2023\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional consulting services agreement with Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc. for operational review and strategic plan development consulting services; to authorize the expenditure of $500,000.00 split among the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code.
