ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe installation and conversion to LED lighting within the project area would provide both an additional sense of safety and security to the residents.  This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nPrime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. contract compliance number is CC-024771 and expires 7/1/27.  \n  \nAs part of this contract Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. has proposed that no subcontractor will be used for this project.  The certification of Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. is in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are appropriated and available within the Electricity Bonds Fund, Fund 6303.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; to authorize the expenditure of up to $127,171.68 from the Electricity Bond Fund to pay for the project.
