    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Strawser Paving Co., Inc. for the Big Walnut Crosswalk at Cherrybottom Road Project. The contract amount is $66,855.00, with a contingency of $8,000.00, for a total of $74,855.00. An additional $2,500.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $77,355.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThis project includes improvements to the pedestrian crosswalk on Cherry Bottom Road, which is 200 feet south of the intersection of Cherry Bottom Road and White Flower Lane. The improvements include the installation of a Rapid Rectangular Flashing Beacon (RRFB) at the crosswalk and the construction of an ADA compliant shared use path. This path will connect the existing curb ramp on the east side of the crosswalk to an existing shared use path in Blendon Woods Metro Park. \n \nThese improvements are being made to increase pedestrian safety at the crosswalk and to connect the surrounding area to the existing shared use path within Blendon Woods Metro Park. The RRFB will provide a visual signal alerting cars to pedestrians who will be crossing the intersection. It will also allow drivers to stop and safely let pedestrians cross the street. An ADA compliant path allows for an accessible connection to the park that does not currently exist. Additionally, this project will provide direct access from the future Big Walnut Trail to Blendon Woods Metro Park.\n \nMetro Parks will be reimbursing Columbus Recreation and Parks $25,000.00 for this project as a partnering organization.
