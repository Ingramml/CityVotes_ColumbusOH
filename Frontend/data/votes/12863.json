    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Office of Real Estate and Land Management for the Whetstone Park of Roses Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of the grant funds. The grant amount available for this project being authorized by this ordinance is $227,360.00. The grant funds will be used towards installing field lighting at two baseball and softball diamonds in Whetstone Park.\n \nFunds from the Community Recreation/Conservation Project Pass-Through Agreement have been made available through House Bill #2 by the 135th General Assembly of the State of Ohio. An application for Community Recreation/Conservation Project Pass-Through funding was originally submitted to the State of Ohio by the North Columbus Intramural League (NCIL), a local youth baseball and softball organization which serves 750 players annually. NCIL utilizes the permitted ball diamonds at Whetstone Park for many of their games and Columbus Recreation and Parks Department was supportive of their grant request. \n \nUpon notice of intent to award, it was necessary for Columbus Recreation and Parks to become the grantee. This is because the Recreation and Parks Department will be responsible for executing the design and construction contracts necessary to complete the improvements. The Recreation and Parks Department will be providing additional funds to cover the full project cost once bidding is completed. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources, Office of Real Estate & Land Management \n2045 Morse Road, Building E-2 \nColumbus, Ohio  43229\nTeresa Goodridge, teresa.goodridge@dnr.ohio.gov\n \nBenefits to the Public: Improvements to lighting at baseball and softball diamonds in Whetstone Park will allow for extended daily play, as well as, additional play during the colder seasons.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The need for the project was brought to the department’s attention through the North Columbus Intramural League (NCIL). NCIL is a locally based youth baseball and softball organization that has served the community for more than 50 years and is a recurring permitted user of the Whetstone Park ball diamonds.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Clintonville (39)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by updating sports-related parks and improving five parks each year.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $227,360.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once the project is ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Office of Real Estate and Land Management for the Whetstone Park of Roses Project and accept a grant in the amount of $227,360.00; and to authorize the appropriation of $227,360.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.
