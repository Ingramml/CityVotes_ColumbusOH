    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Miles-McClellan Construction Company, Inc. for the North Bank Pavilion Interior Renovations and Fountain Conversion Project. The contract amount is $733,300.00, with an alternate of $40,334.00 and a contingency of $100,000.00, for a total of $873,634.00. An additional $2,500.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $876,134.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nNorth Bank Pavilion is a premiere rental venue generating more than $250,000.00 in annual revenue for the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department. Although there have been additional projects to expand its amenities since original construction, the original structure and associated fountain have components dating to when it was first built. In order to keep this facility meeting premiere facility standards, many items need updated and renovated. This will include replacement of HVAC equipment which is at the end of its useful life and approaching failure.\n \nThe fountain system is failing and many of the over 15 year old components are no longer available. Renovations would require complete replacement of most internal components. Since the current location of the fountain conflicts with desired programming, this project will remove the fountain without replacement. The area will be expanded to a support larger event space, as requested by guests.\n \nPeak rental season runs April through October and the goal is to minimize any impact to the events calendar. The project is planned to begin construction in late fall 2025 so that the facility may be available for rentals in spring 2026.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Bids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 6, 2025 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 10, 2025. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nMiles-McClellan Construction: $773,634.00\n2K General: $866,000.00\nBerglund Construction: $905,000.00\nSetterlin Building: $948,000.00\nElford: $998,444.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Miles-McClellan Construction Company, Inc. was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Miles-McClellan Construction Company, Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMiles-McClellan Construction Company, Inc. \n2100 Builders Place\nColumbus, Ohio 43204\nBrad Bloomberg, (614) 487-7744                                                    \nContract Compliance Number: 004557\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 9, 2027\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by renovating a popular rental facility. The public reserves this location for many types of events and this project will help enhance their experience. General park visitors will be able to enjoy the fresh look of the area and the new amenities that will be added.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Numerous 311 complaints have been received about misuse of the fountain which has created concerns over the health and safety of park visitors. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Downtown (55)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by increasing departmental excellence in programming, service delivery, and sustainability. \n \nFiscal Impact: $876,134.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Miles-McClellan Construction Company, Inc. for the North Bank Pavilion Interior Renovation and Fountain Conversion Project; to authorize the transfer of $876,134.00 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $876,134.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $876,134.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
