    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This ordinance amends various chapters throughout Title 39 and Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes. Title 39 is the portion of Columbus City Codes governing the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. Chapter 329 is the portion of Columbus City Codes governing the award of City contracts. These changes vary in nature from clarifying and specifying certain administrative functions to expansions of the keystone programming under the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\nAs an overview, the code changes in this ordinance are as follows:\n•                     3901.01 Definition of terms.\no                     Removing the definition of “Emerging Business Enterprise.”\no                     Adding the definition of “Program.”\no                     Adding the definition of “Program member.”\no                     Adding the definition of “Regional Business Enterprise (RBE).”\n•                     3902.01 Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\no                     Amending the office responsibility to include assisting economically disadvantaged small, regional businesses. \n•                     3902.02 Duties of the Director.\no                     Amending the Director’s duties to include promulgating and enforcing rules and regulations for small, regional businesses in the form of a Program Manual.\n•                     3902.04 Workforce development.\no                     Replacing Workforce diversity with Workforce development. This expands the program to focus on socioeconomic factors.\n•                     Chapter 3903 Assistance activities.\no                     Clarifying that assistance activities are limited to certified small and/or regional businesses, but that minority and/or women-owned businesses may continue to be certified for identification purposes, provided that such minority and women-owned businesses shall not be the beneficiaries of assistance activities until such times as City Council reauthorizes those activities pursuant to Section 3907.98 of the Columbus City Codes. \n•                     3904.01 Small Regional Business Enterprise Program and Regional Business Enterprise Program.\no                     Adding the Regional Business Enterprise (RBE) certification. This expands the certification program to businesses within the State of Ohio.\no                     Amending the SRBE eligibility criteria pertaining to the size of the business. The changes proposed in this ordinance would amend the eligibility to require that the small regional business size standards are proportionate to the SBA size standards, in accordance with 13 C.F.R. Part 121.\nThese changes will improve the effectiveness of the programs and strengthen the operations of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion as authorized under Title 39.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Title 39 and Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and to repeal certain existing sections of Title 39 and Chapter 329, in order to update, clarify, and strengthen code regarding the operations of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and its programs.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is dedicated to creating and implementing programs, policies, and procedures that will deliver and capture value through supplier development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion assists economically disadvantaged, local, and regional businesses with gaining greater access to procurement opportunities and resources to build viable and sustainable businesses; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to further the mission of supporting economically disadvantaged, local, and regional businesses by creating additional pathways to procurement opportunities; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
