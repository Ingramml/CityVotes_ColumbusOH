    "title": "To authorize the Director of Neighborhoods to enter a service contract with Libby V & Associates, LLC; to authorize the waiver of competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($100,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Dept. of Neighborhoods to enter into a service contract with Libby V & Associates, LLC in support of the second annual Getting Grant Ready Academy, a program through which nonprofit organizations are offered a curriculum for capacity-building that will ultimately aim to help them successfully obtain more grant funding from a variety of sources. This program was led last year by the Human Services Chamber (Ordinance 1840-2024), which is not available this year to hold the grant with the City Clerk. Libby V & Associates was involved in the program last year and is prepared to lead the program this year. Due to their unique institutional knowledge of and experience with the program, the Dept. of Neighborhoods seeks to waive competitive bidding. The funding authorized by this ordinance will be used to provide up-front financial support for the program.\n \nNonprofits will take part in workshops where they will learn nonprofit management skills including creating compelling mission and vision statements, board management, financial management, systems and processes, operational efficiency, marketing, and communications. There will also be workshops on fundraising basics and best practices, including targeted sessions on specific grant topics (e.g. grants strategy, grants research, no or go decision-making, grants management and reporting, corporate grants, foundation grants, government grants, etc.). Nonprofit organizations will also receive one-on-one coaching for individualized support, through which they will be walked through a full grant process, from research to application and setting up for capturing data and reporting.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018. Councilmember Day-Acheur earmarked these funds in this year's annual operating budget.\n \nWAIVER OF FORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS: A waiver of the formal competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 is requested for this purchase because Libby V & Associates, LLC was involved in the program last year and has unique knowledge and experience that will likely make them especially effective in this role.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Neighborhoods to enter a service contract with Libby V & Associates, LLC; to authorize the waiver of competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Getting Grant Ready Academy is designed to provide direct support to nonprofit organizations to help them be more successful in building their own capacity and obtaining grant funding from myriad sources; and\n \nWHEREAS, nonprofits will take part in workshops where they will learn nonprofit management skills such as creating compelling mission and vision statements, board management, financial management, systems and processes, operational efficiency, marketing and communications; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Human Service Chamber Foundation is unavailable to hold the grant this year in the same way they did in 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, Libby V & Associates, LLC was involved in the program last year and is prepared to contract with the Dept. of Neighborhoods to bring their unique experience and expertise to bear on this iteration of the program; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Neighborhoods is hereby authorized and directed to enter a service contract with Libby V & Associates, LLC in support of their capacity-building curriculum for nonprofit organizations.\n \nSECTION 2. That per the action authorized in SECTION 1 of this ordinance, the appropriation and expenditure of $100,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund is hereby authorized per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That City Council finds that it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to waive the formal competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts and contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 6. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
