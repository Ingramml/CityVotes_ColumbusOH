    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify and increase funding for the Professional Construction Manager at Risk (CMaR) Services agreement, with Gilbane-Smoot Columbus a Joint Venture (hereinafter “Gilbane-Smoot”), for the New Municipal Court Building project, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, in an amount up to $841,900.00, and to encumber funds within the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in the amount of $2,000.00.\n \nThe original agreement under PO482523, established the initial Construction Manager at Risk (CMaR) Services agreement and was authorized by Ordinance No. 1854-2023, and approved by City Council on July 10, 2023. \n \nModification No. 1, under PO495250, continued Phase 1 services, Site Development / Pre-Construction Services and was authorized by Ordinance No. 3302-2024, and approved by City Council on December 9, 2024.\n \nModification No. 2 (current) will allow Gilbane-Smoot to engage trade contractors to assist Moody Nolan (the design firm) in the design details and construction document stages of the project.  The contractors will provide accurate estimating and scheduling information, as well as providing cost saving ideas and improved constructability reviews.  The trades include structural steel, curtain wall, HVAC, electrical, and plumbing. \n \n2. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.  The amt of additional funds to be expended under the modification:  $841,900.00  \n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $     84,177.00  (PO482523)\nModification No. 1:                     $   927,000.00  (PO495250)\nModification No. 2 (current):                     $   841,900.00\nTotal (Original and Mods 1-2):                     $1,853,077.00\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nModifications to the contract were foreseen and indicated in the original legislation under Ord. 1854-2023 as well as Modification No. 1 under Ord. 3302-2024.  \n \nC.  Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\nThis is a large, complex, multi-phased, multi-year contract in which Smoot-Gilbane is responsible for full construction services.  They will perform a competitive procurement process to obtain subcontractors necessary to fulfill the needs of the project.  Piecemealing the process would not be feasible in terms of time, cost, and logistics.\n \nD.  How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nGilbane-Smoot provided a fee proposal and was accepted by the Office of Construction Management.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: DAX No. 4494, expires 1/5/26\n \n4.  FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  There are 3 phases to this project:\nPhase 1 - Site Development / Pre-Construction Services\nPhase 2 - Building Core and Shell\nPhase 3 - Interior Construction\n \nMultiple modifications within each phase will be necessary depending on changes to the scope and/or availability of funds.  \n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  It is requested that this Ordinance be handled in an emergency manner in order to maintain the current schedule and minimize project delays.\n \n6.
