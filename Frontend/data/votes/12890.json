    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nAs part of maintaining quality and continuity in its financial systems, the City Auditor’s Office employs system testing of Dayforce, Dynamics, and Tax systems prior to implementing new features, applying changes to configuration, or receiving product release updates by the software manufacturer. This systems management control and best practice allows for advanced defect detection and ensures a low failure rate for maintaining system stability. By testing in advance, it allows the City to identify any bugs and work with the software providers to receive a fix prior to it reaching production. With the depth and breadth of system functionality offered by these complex systems, as well as the frequency at which the City receives updates, manual testing is labor intensive and comes at an opportunity cost by testing existing processes versus implementing improvements. By implementing automated testing of common scenarios and processes, City resources can focus more on optimization and enhancements.  Additionally, configuration changes can be tested quicker and more thoroughly through testing automation. \nThe Auditor’s Office conducted a Request for Statement of Qualifications (RFSQ) in accordance with Columbus City Code Section 329.27 for automated testing software, professional consulting for quality assurance and testing best practices, and technical services for implementation and ongoing support of the software. \nThe first step of the process requested a Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) from prospective offerors which was used to evaluate (1) the competence of the Offeror to perform the required service; (2) the ability of the Offeror to perform the required service competently and expeditiously; (3) past performance of the Offeror as reflected by the evaluations of the city agency, other city agencies, and other previous clients of the Offeror; and (4) functionality of proposed solution. \nEight (8) responses were received and evaluated. After reviewing the responses, the evaluation committee ranked the proposals per the evaluation criteria listed in the SOQ and the evaluation committee selected the four (4) highest rated offerors to proceed to the second step (Request for Technical Proposals) of the procurement process. The responses were ranked as follows:\n1)                     OnActuate (Leapwork)\n2)                     Illumina Technology (Leapwork)\n3)                     Abjayon \n4)                     TTC Global (Tricentis Tosca)\n5)                     Avo Automation\n6)                     The TestMart\n7)                     DBISP LLC (Leapwork)\n8)                     XPLUS SA (Executive Automats)\nAll the Offerors were notified of the selection of the four (4) highest rated Offerors that were selected to participate in the Request for Technical Proposals.\nThe second step of the process requested a technical proposal (RFTP) from the four (4) highest rated offerors selected from step one, which was used to evaluate Offerors’ (1) Project Plan, (2) Proposed System, and (3) Cost and Payment terms. \nThree (3) of the four (4) remaining Offerors - OnActuate (Leapwork), TTC Global (Tricentis Tosca), and Abjayon - submitted technical proposals and separately demonstrated its solution to the evaluation committee following City provided scripts. Using real City examples, the demonstrations exhibited how each product aligned with functional matrix, usability, product capabilities, and other features for support.\nThe committee reviewed the content of the technical proposals (RFTP), considered the presentation and demonstration content, and all other pertinent information received. The Offerors were re-ranked according to the RFTP scoring criteria with OnActuate and Leapwork being the highest rated and recommended offerors.  \nLeapwork is the software provider of its products and support services. It licenses its products on a subscription basis directly to the City. OnActuate Consulting US, Inc is an authorized partner for providing implementation and consulting services for Leapwork. \nBeyond the proposed software training provided by Leapwork and OnActuate in the RFSQ, additional best practice training and quality assurance consulting were desired to improve project outcomes. Lighthouse Technologies is an Ohio based quality assurance and software testing trainer and provider. It was selected in accordance with Columbus City Code 329.25 to provide in-person workshops covering agile software testing principles to Auditor’s staff and professional quality assurance consulting services on an as needed basis. It was chosen for its specialized workshops, knowledge of the quality assurance process, and discounted rates offered. \nGiven the number of systems involved, the complexity and volume of test plans, and implementing in a phased approach, the contracts for implementation would be for an initial three (3) year term for Leapwork LLC and OnActuate Consulting US, Inc. The Leapwork software contract will include the option to renew annually for software subscription and support subject to annual appropriation and approval by Council. The contract for Lighthouse would be a one-year term for training and professional quality assurance services for the initial onset of the project and contain two (2) annual renewal options, subject to annual appropriation and approval by Council.  \n \nContract Compliance: \nLeapwork LLC CC# CC-050307, expires 5/28/2027, D365#050307\nPrincipal place of business:  222 Berkeley St, Boston, MA 02116\n \nOnActuate Consulting US, Inc.
