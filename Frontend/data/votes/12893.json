    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nOn December 12, 2022, the Columbus City Treasurer's Office, in collaboration with the Department of Finance and Management and the City Auditor’s Office, issued a request for proposal, RFQ023687, for various banking services. An Evaluation Committee comprised of five representatives from the City Treasurer’s Office, Department of Public Utilities, Department of Finance and Management, Division of Income Tax, and the City Auditor’s Office received and reviewed proposals from six (6) banks. On May 12, 2023, a joint meeting of the Columbus Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board was held at which the Treasurer presented the Evaluation Committee’s rankings of offerors. The Treasurer recommended, and the Depository Commission and Treasury Investment Board approved, subject to successful negotiation and the approval of City Council, the award of banking services to specific banks.\n \nAll such banks are currently eligible depositories of the City of Columbus, pursuant to Section 321.04 of the Columbus City Codes. The contracts are for a period of ten (10) years, beginning September 1, 2023, through August 31, 2033, subject to annual appropriations and approval of contracts by the Columbus City Council.\n \nThe initial contract term was made 17 months to better align the annual term with the city’s budget.\n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: _________$   34,100.00\nCost summary: \nOriginal Contract, Ordinance #1689-2023                                                                $     15,000.00\nModification #1, Ordinance #3278-2023                                                                                         $     41,000.00\nModification #2, Ordinance #0029-2024                                                                           $     10,000.00\nModification/Renewal #3, Ordinance #0287-2025                                          $       8,000.00\nModification #4, (This Ordinance)                                                                                                                $     34,100.00 \nEstimated Contract Total:                                                                                                  $   108,100.00\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:The original contract awarded to Fifth Third was for both investment safekeeping and smart safe banking services.  Ordinance 1689-2023 was allocated to investment safekeeping.  Contract language specific to the smart safe have recently been finalized and allowed any city agency to adopt smart safe banking services, when the Treasurer’s Office is ready to deploy it.  The Treasurer, Parking, Public Utilities and now Police wish to implement smart safe banking services. The use of smart safe was anticipated in concept but contract terms and conditions had not been finalized at the time of original contract execution.\nThe City Treasurer’s Office will cover the first year of smart safe services for the Division of Police, estimated at approximately $12,000.00, with the understanding that the Division of Police will assume responsibility for associated costs in future years.\n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:The city conducted a competitive bidding process under RFQ023687 and awarded a ten-year contract to Fifth Third Bank for investment safekeeping and smart safe services. It is not in the city’s best interest to re-bid these services, as pricing was competitively established and the contract was structured to allow for agency-specific expansions over time. This modification ensures continuity, integration, and cost-efficiency.\n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:The pricing structure for smart safe services was established during the original competitive bid. The Department of Public Utilities developed a funding estimate based on equipment sizing, cash volume needs, and site-specific requirements. The requested $34,100.00 reflects this estimate and conforms to the contract’s pricing framework.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:This ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure uninterrupted implementation of smart safe banking services for the Department of Public Utilities, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Public Service and the City Treasurer’s Office.\nFISCAL IMPACT:Funds for these expenditures are available from the various funds within the city.  This ordinance is consistent with the second quarter financial review.\nContract Compliance: Fifth Third Bank, 310676865, expiration 5/12/2027.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to modify its contract for banking services with Fifth Third Bank; to authorize the expenditure of $34,100.00 from various funds within the Department of Public Utilities, and City Treasurer’s Office; and to declare an emergency. ($34,100.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer proposed the award of contracts for banking services as provided for in RFQ023687 issued on December 12, 2022, for which the Columbus Depository Commission, at a meeting held on May 12, 2023, recommended the award of banking services, subject to approval by Columbus City Council; and\nWHEREAS, the contract for banking services was authorized by Columbus City Council with the passage of Ordinance 1689-2023 on July 17, 2023; and\nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council authorized a modification to the contract for implementation of smart safe services for the City Treasurer and the Division of Parking with the passage of Ordinance 3278-2023 on December 4, 2023; and\nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council further authorized additional funding of $10,000.00 for implementation of smart safe services for the Department of Public Utilities with the passage of Ordinance 0029-2024 on January 10, 2024; and\nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council authorized the renewal of the contract with Fifth Third Bank for the period April 1, 2025, through March 31, 2026, and approved $8,000.00 in funding on behalf of the City Treasurer for investment safekeeping and smart safe banking services with the passage of Ordinance 0287-2025 on February 10, 2025; and\nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer now wishes to modify the existing contract with Fifth Third Bank to authorize an additional $34,100.00 for expanded smart safe services on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities, the Department of Public Safety, the Department of Public Service and City Treasurer’s Office; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of the Treasurer in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Treasurer to modify its contract with Fifth Third Bank for the provision of smart safe banking services and to authorize related expenditures to support departmental operations and financial processing, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
