    "description": ".Explanation\n                      \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity (Women’s CEO) in support of the Aspire Business Accelerator.\n \nThe Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity empowers individuals to turn their entrepreneurial aspirations into scalable ventures that contribute to the growth and prosperity of their community and all of Columbus. This empowers economically disadvantaged people to access the knowledge and resources needed to create generational wealth, and a legacy of economic impact.\n \nThis grant will support the Women’s CEO Aspire Business Accelerator program, which has already served over 50 entrepreneurs. In addition to helping these leaders scale their businesses, Women’s CEO also partners with a variety of fellow business support organizations to ensure that business owners are fully supported.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an upfront payment to the Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity to support the execution of Aspire Business Accelerator. The Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity does not currently have sufficient funds on-hand to await reimbursement for expenses incurred.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested as the business accelerator program began in April, and thirty-day legislation would significantly delay the City Clerk’s ability to begin reimbursing eligible expenses incurred by the Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Women’s Center for Economic Opportunity in support of their Aspire Business Accelerator program; to authorize the reimbursement of qualifying expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order; to authorize an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
