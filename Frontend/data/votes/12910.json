    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify an existing contract with Double Z Construction Company to increase funding for the Intersection - Broad Street at James Road project in an amount up to $724,924.95.\nOrdinance 0936-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Double Z Construction Company for the construction of the Intersection - Broad Street at James Road project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.\n \nOrdinance 2338-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, accepted and expended awarded grant funds, and issued refunds, if necessary, for the Intersection Improvements - Broad Street at James Road.\n \nThe work performed to date for this project consists of the lighting work, as well as roadside work on all corners of the intersection and the medians on the south side.  Remaining work consists of final surface paving, striping, and signal work.  \n \nThe work for this modification will consist of compensation to the contractor for delay costs associated with utility delays as the contractor was unable to work during the period. \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $724,924.95\nThe original contract amount, no inspection:                             $5,827,391.25  (PO382699, Ord. 0936-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:                     $724,924.95     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:  $6,552,316.20  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis was not an anticipated modification. A delay to the project was encountered because of an unidentified AT&T line that was in direct conflict with the underground detention system designed for the plans. The designer had a line shown in the plans that was not identified as telecom, nor identified as a conflict. AT&T also did not identify the conflict during plan design. The issue was uncovered during construction resulting in a near year-long delay to redesign the project around the AT&T line because it had critical lines on it that would have resulted in a longer relocation timeline.  This modification will allow work to proceed and payments to be made to contractor for costs of delay.   \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nFurther delay through use of procurement other than emergency modification will cost delay costs, incurred by contractor, to rise even further.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original contract. The calculation of delay costs were based on the contractor’s submitted Delay Summary, which included extra labor, material cost increases, extended overhead, and seasonal remobilization tied to project delays and change orders. The primary causes of these extra costs were plan revisions related to storm drainage, unforeseen site conditions, and delays in the project schedule, resulting in both delay-related and regular change orders. To help offset the extra costs, the project eliminated unnecessary items during plan revisions by removing storm structures, pipes, street trees, and similar elements.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Double Z Construction Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Double Z Construction Company is CC-005966 and expires 6/3/27.\n \n3.  Pre-Qualification Status\nDouble Z Construction Company and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract modification is a reimbursable budgeted expense of $724,924.95 within the Federal Transportation Grant Fund, Fund 7765, Grant #G592104 (Broad St at James Rd 110388).  Funds need to be appropriated.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent further and more costly delays in the completion of modification 1 for the Intersection Improvements - Broad Street at James Road project to facilitate the completion of the project’s planned improvements in a timely manner, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the Federal Transportation Grants Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Double Z Construction Company to increase funding in connection with the Intersection Improvements - Broad Street at James Road projects; to authorize the expenditure of up to $724,924.95 from the Federal Transportation Grants Fund; to repay any unused grant funds at the end of the grant period; and to declare an emergency.  ($724,924.95) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
