    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Public Service to reimburse the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for additional construction costs incurred during the completion of FRA-71-17.76, PID 77369. \nThe aforementioned effort was the first phase of the Downtown Ramp Up, a larger multi-phase interstate reconstruction project intended to alleviate congestion and safety issues on the Interstate 70 (I-70) and Interstate 71 (I-71) corridor in Downtown Columbus administered by ODOT. FRA-71-17.76, PID 77369, also known as Roadway Improvements - I-670/71 Interchange - Phase 1, encompassed various improvements I-670 and I-71, including realignment of I-670 eastbound from west of Cleveland Avenue to east of Saint Clair Avenue, and construction of three cap structures at the Spring Street and Long Street bridge crossings.  \nOrdinance 1838-2010 authorized the execution of a contribution agreement between ODOT and Department of Public Service relative to that project and the encumbrance and expenditure of $2,463,374.67 to support the estimated share of construction and inspection costs to be borne by the City. ODOT recently informed the Department of Public Service the actual costs attributable to the City exceeded that sum. This legislation seeks to authorize the Department of Public Service to pay the additional sum of $130,525.43 to ODOT for those cost overruns.  \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nAuditor Certificate ACPO011262 previously was established pursuant to Ordinance 2981-2024 to support this and other expenditures related to the Downtown Ramp Up.  \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to satisfy its outstanding financial obligation to ODOT by September 30, 2025. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Department of Public Service to pay the sum of $130,525.43 to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) as reimbursement for additional construction costs incurred by ODOT during the completion of FRA-71-17.76; and to declare an emergency.
