    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with The EDGE Group, Inc. to provide construction services associated with the Hauntz, Helsel, and Willow Creek Park Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $240,625.59, with a contingency of $9,000.00, for a total of $249,625.59.\n \nThis is a planned contract modification to provide additional professional design services for the construction phase of this project. Design services include the preparation of a tree survey, public tree plan, conceptual plans, and construction documents for the pump track at Helsel Park. They also include ongoing coordination meetings and pre-installation services for naturalized areas. The modification will also prepare punch list, as-built plans, and statement of special inspections for park structures. This is a planned modification, with services not included in the original contract since the specific scope of work and associated hours were dependent on the outcomes of the community engagement and feasibility results during earlier phases.   \n \nThe original project completion date of the project was December 31, 2028. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will remain December 31, 2028. \nAmount of Additional Funds: $249,625.59\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: These additional services were foreseen. However, the level of effort required to complete the services was unknown at the time of the initial contract scope and fee negotiation because the project scope was yet unknown. As with any park development project that begins with a master planning and community engagement phase, planned modifications for design development, construction documentation, and construction services are included. This ensures the appropriate level of scope and fee is negotiated. Additionally, when the original contract was executed, the tree technical manual, which prescribes the completion of the tree survey and public tree plan, had not yet been established.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: The current contractor has in-depth understanding of the project needs and expertise in the specific nuances of the subject matter. As a result, modifying this vendor's contract is more cost efficient than awarding the additional scope to a potentially different vendor through another procurement process.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The price for additional services was determined on negotiated scope based on established hourly rates in the original contract.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nThe EDGE Group, Inc. \n330 West Spring Street, Suite 350    \nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nTedd Hardesty, (614) 486-3343    \nContract Compliance Number: 001500\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: April 25, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to allow Recreation and Parks to modify the contract as soon as possible so that the Helsel Park plans can advance at the same pace as the grant-funded Big Walnut Trail Winchester to Nafzger Park project, since the Helsel Park construction will be packaged with the trail construction that passes through the park.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Access to trails and key destinations is one of the top rated priorities noted by Columbus residents. This project will bring a variety of new amenities to underutilized parks in the Southwest and Mideast Communities, highlighting the natural resources each park has to offer. This project will also position the parks as trailheads and destinations on a future regional trail.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Recreation and Parks hosted two engagement sessions in each community and gathered additional input through electronic surveys and workshops. Helsel Park also had a third engagement session.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Southwest (59), Mid East (57)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by updating sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $ $950,900.00 was legislated for the Hauntz, Helsel, and Willow Creek Park Improvements Project by Ordinances 1419-2023 and 0530-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $249,625.59. $249,625.59 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,200,525.59.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with The EDGE Group, Inc. for the Hauntz, Helsel and Willow Creek Park Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $249,625.59 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $249,625.59 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $249,625.59 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
