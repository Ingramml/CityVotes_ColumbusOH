    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program to acquire four properties for preservation of the City’s natural resources.\n \nThe Ohio Public Works Commission’ Clean Ohio Clean Ohio Conservation Fund is accepting 2026 applications for funding to preserve natural areas and green space. OPWC requires that a resolution, ordinance, or other written documentation to obligate funds for the project as part of the application. This ordinance is a commitment to provide the necessary match funds at a later date to satisfactorily complete the proposed project and become eligible for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the grant. If the grant funding is awarded, future legislation will follow to authorize acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of City funds.\n \nThe four properties have been broken down into three potential projects.\n \nThe North Star Project will acquire two properties, comprising 6 acres along the central reach of Alum Creek, in the near North East Community of Columbus. Both sites lie within a half mile of each other and would complete substantial missing pieces of riparian preservation along the waterway. These two sites will play an important role in the Recreation and Parks Department’s ongoing development of a “learning landscape” along the Alum Creek Trail, portraying the role the stream played in the 19th century route of the Underground Railroad. \n \nThe McNaughten Woods project would acquire 25 acres of high quality greenspace in the City’s Far East Community, near the Mount Carmel East Medical Campus. The site is in excellent natural condition and the project would provide the largest protected parkland in an extremely underserved community.  \n \nThe Far West Greenspace Protection project would acquire a 75 acre parcel of land in the Big Darby Creek watershed for preservation as greenspace. The property includes a segment of the Clover Groff Stream. It offers a significant long-term benefit for residents, including natural area preservation, stream restoration, recreational opportunities, and critical upland protection in the region's highest water quality watershed.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\n77 South High Street East State Street, Suite 1846\nColumbus, Ohio  43215\nLinda Bailiff (614) 752-6829\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested to meet the application deadline of August 29, 2025. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Acquiring these properties will benefit the public through protection of the City’s high quality natural resources, inner city park space, greenway corridors, ravines, and urban forests.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Northeast, Far East, and Far West communities have expressed strong support for preserving sites for greenspace, parkland, and conservation.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Northeast (41), Far East (58)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by protecting and expanding tree canopy. It will also provide quality recreational parks, trails, and improved connectivity for Columbus residents.  \n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. Future legislation will accept, appropriate, and encumber funding for this project as needed if the grant is awarded.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Conservation Fund to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors, including the acquisition of four properties for preservation of the City’s natural resources; and to declare an emergency.
