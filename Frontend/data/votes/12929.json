    "description": "Explanation\n  \nThis legislation authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Mayors Office, to modify services contract with The Center for Healthy Families, Inc, a non-profit corporation. The original contract utilized funding from the Ohio Department of Medicaid Grant (G402500) for home visiting services.  This modification is necessary to continue the work, aimed at reducing the infant mortality rate in the City of Columbus, as home visiting is no longer covered by the Ohio Department of Medicaid.  \n \nThe contract is for the period of January 1st 2025 to December 31st 2025.  This modification is to edit the services from “home visiting” to “young parental support and educational services”.  There is no additional fiscal cost for this modification. The need for the change has arisen due to changes in the reimbursable costs via the Department of Medicaid that have occurred over the timeline of this grant cycle. It is in the best interest of the City to finish the work of this grant, by allowing the Center for Healthy Family to continue their other programming endeavor that also strives towards the goal of reducing the infant mortality rate. These services are already known and the costs are comparable to the initial home visiting services. \n \nThis Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications.\n \nSUPPLIER:  The Center for Healthy Families Inc., FID# 208701526, D365 Vendor ID #011320, Expires 03/22/2026\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the System for Award Management of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no additional funding require so there is no further fiscal impact. The funding of $130,000.00 was allotted for the 2025 ODM Grant Cycle by Ord. 0480-2025, of which $64,467.81 remains for the 2025 calendar year. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: This ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to allow services to continue that will aid in reducing the infant mortality rate, per the goals of CelebrateOne and the Ohio Department of Medicaid Grant, for the health and prosperity of City of Columbus citizens.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Executive Director of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Mayors Office, to modify the contract with The Center for Healthy Families.
