    "description": "BACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to execute a not for profit service contract with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, a non-profit corporation, for their Summer Youth Workforce & Career Development fellowship program, which provides an eight (8) week paid summer youth fellowship program with the goal of learning life & work skills alongside professionals in the health care field and become positive sexual health messengers within their community.  \n \nCosts for the program include specific deliverables including guest speaker fees, education materials, marketing and advertising of the program for enrollment, and staff costs to conduct the training.  Invoice(s) will include specific details regarding the services and training provided.  The vendor will not invoice for any costs not stated in the attached Program Proposal (see Item 2. Estimated Budget).\n \nThe Summer Youth Workforce & Career Development fellowship program will consist of three (3) cohorts of youth ages 14-19 for a total of 50 youth in the full fellowship program. The program includes six (6) lessons on resume preparation, interviewing skills, work permits and tax issues, communication/customer service skills, information on local higher education opportunities.\n \nThe fellowships will also include 20 hours of sexual health education to include topics such as anatomy, physiology, gender, communication, sexually transmitted infections and teen pregnancy prevention, healthy relationships, consent, and more will be included in addition to the workforce development syllabus.  In addition to having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation, Ohio ranks 23rd out of all 50 states for teenage pregnancies. Teen pregnancy is a significant contributor to pre-maturity, a leading cause of infant mortality, because pregnant teens have a higher risk for having a baby born too small or too soon.\n \nA recent examination of the National Survey of Family Growth revealed that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50% less likely to report a pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education. Currently, without any state health education standards, many teens in Ohio and Franklin County do not have access to comprehensive, medically-accurate sex education.\n \nThis summer youth program cannot be completed by the existing CelebrateOne staff as the staffing level is not adequate to conduct this 8 week program.\n \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Ohio is a Not-For-Profit Organization, Tax ID # 34-1015976, DAX# 027518.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: This ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to allow the continuation of program funding that is critical to the operation and goals of CelebrateOne and all the subsequent agencies dependent upon these grant for the continuation of programs for the health and prosperity of City of Columbus citizens.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This not for profit service contract was budgeted within the 2025 General Fund 1000 Budget for CelebrateOne.  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $140,000.00 within the General Fund. \n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to execute a not for profit service contract with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio for a Summer Youth Workforce & Career Development Program in support of the CelebrateOne goal to improve reproductive health planning; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $140,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($140,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus supports the objectives of the Summer Youth Workforce and Career Development Program offered to Columbus area youth by Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and the Ohio Center for Sex Education; and \n \nWHEREAS, CelebrateOne supports reproductive health education that is included in the curriculum of the Summer Youth Workforce and Career Development Program to reduce the number teenage pregnancies in order to minimize premature births and infant mortality rates within Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $140,000.00 from the General Fund 1000 in support of the Summer Youth Workforce & Career Development Program; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the CelebrateOne in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and expend these funds for the summer program with Planned Parenthood; without delay so that the funding for this summer program is available during the allotted program time, to allow the continuation of this program of CelebrateOne and it’s grantee, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety; \nNOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, is authorized to execute a not for profit service contract with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio in the amount of $140,000.00 for a Summer Youth Workforce and Career Development Program. \n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $140,000.00 is hereby authorized from General Fund 1000 according to the funding codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this contract is entered into under the provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 regarding non-profit service contracts.\nSECTION 4.
