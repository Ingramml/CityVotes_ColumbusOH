    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate two federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners Office of Justice Policy and Programs to the City Attorney’s Office. Grant awards support specialized prosecution and victim advocacy services for survivors of domestic violence and stalking. Award dollars fund 1) a portion of salary expenses for two specially trained domestic violence prosecutors, 2) total compensation for one specially trained stalking victim advocate, 3) registration fees for professional development, and 4) contract fees for interpretation and translation services.\n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Domestic Violence & Stalking Prosecution Unit provides best-practice prosecution services for victims of misdemeanor domestic violence and stalking crimes. The unit employs six highly-trained and experienced domestic violence prosecutors, twenty victim advocates, one stalking investigator, one anti-stalking victim advocate and hosts professional liaisons from Capital University Law School’s Civil Protection Unit. Services provided by the unit are modeled after the National District Attorneys Association’s National Domestic Violence Prosecution Best Practice Guide and are designed to improve victim engagement; decrease recantation; and increase community and law enforcement collaboration. This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of grant funds. \n \nFiscal Impact: VAWA sub awards require a 25% city cash match. The cash match ($63,241.51) is tracked by the CAO fiscal team with records of expenses maintained in grant files.\n \n\n\n\nAward #\n\nAward\n\nMatch \n\n\n\n24-WF-VA2-8758\n\n$106,000.00\n\n$35,333.33\n\n\n\n24-WF-VA2-4600\n\n$83,724.55\n\n$27,908.18\n\n\n\n2024 VAWA total\n\n$189,724.55\n\n$63,241.51\n\n\n \nEmergency Action: \nExecuted grant contracts from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners were delayed, therefore emergency action is requested to ensure timely reimbursement for grant supported services provided through the first two quarters of 2025.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to accept federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards 24- WF-VA2-8758 and 24-WF-VA2-4600 from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners' Office of Justice Policy and Programs in the amount of $189,724.55 to support domestic violence and stalking prosecution and victim advocacy services; to authorize grant expenditures and the appropriation of $189,724.55 in the general government grant fund; and to declare an emergency. ($189,724.55)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Franklin County Board of Commissioners' Office of Justice Policy and Programs has awarded the Columbus City Attorney's Office grant funding in the amount of $189,724.55 to support domestic violence prosecution and stalking victim advocacy services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the term of grant funding is for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025; and \n \nWHEREAS, the grant award requires a city cash match of 25% ($63,241.51) to be tracked and documented in grant file; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney desires to accept said grant award; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Attorney's Office in that these award contracts support direct services to victim of violent crimes from January 1st, 2025 through December 31st, 2025, yet the fully executed subaward contracts from the County were not returned to the City until July 2nd, 2025. Therefore, an emergency exists to immediately authorize the City Attorney to accept the award and appropriate award funds so the department may accept grant reimbursement for services render through Q2 of 2025 and relieve the general fund for grant expenses incurred, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS, OHIO\n \nSECTION 1.  That the City Attorney is hereby authorized to accept Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards 24- WF-VA2-8758 and 24-WF-VA2-4600 from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners' Office of Justice Policy and Programs in the amount of $189,724.55 to support domestic violence and stalking prosecution and victim advocacy services.\nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the General Government Grants Fund number 2220, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources during the grant period, the sum of $189,724.55 is hereby appropriated to the Columbus City Attorney, Department 24 according to the attached accounting document.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds appropriated shall be paid upon order of the City Attorney and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
