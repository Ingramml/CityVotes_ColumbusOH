    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND  \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services agreement with CTL Engineering of Ohio, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Substation Subsurface Investigation project, in an amount up to $335,743.68, for Division of Power, CIP No. 670901-100002. \n \nThe design of a capital improvement project to modernize the Jackson Pike substation was suspended when preliminary field investigations indicated the potential presence of subsurface void(s) indicative of Karst features. (Bedrock dissolving resulting in unstable ground.)  These findings raised concerns about the structural stability of the substation infrastructure.  The potential risk of ground subsidence and the resulting damage to critical electrical components necessitates a thorough investigation to accurately identify and address these subsurface conditions before proceeding with any further improvements at the substation.\n \nThis project will investigate the subsurface voids, determine their cause, and mitigation strategies should karst voids be confirmed.\n \nThe community area is “99 - City-Wide”.\n \nTIMELINE & FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  \nThe work is estimated to last approximately seven months but may take longer. The contract will start when a Notice To Proceed is issued and will end when the work is complete and accepted by the City. \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nThe negotiated professional services agreement amount is $335,743.68, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract                                                                                     $ 335,743.68\n                     Future Anticipated Needs                                                             $           0.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                  $ 335,743.68\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will determine the path forward for continuing the improvement/modernization efforts at the Jackson Pike substation to provide a more resilient and reliable power distribution system.  The improvements will improve reliability and result in fewer power interruptions to the customers served by this substation which will minimize any economic impacts due to power outages.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION \nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 1/17/25.   One proposal was received:\n \nName                                                                                     C.C.
