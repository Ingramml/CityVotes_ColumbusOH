    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes an appropriation in support of programming responsive to extreme heat and cooling events, as well as authorizing agreements with specific agencies providing services.\n \nAs temperatures rise during the summer, there is a need for the city to support the availability of cooling centers where residents can take refuge. This is especially important for seniors, young children, low-income residents, and others who are especially vulnerable to the potential harmful impacts of extreme heat. Likewise, during the winter months, inclement weather and extreme cold poses the same risks and thus the same need to support the provision of warming centers.\n \nCouncil has established funding in the 2025 operating budget to offer ongoing support for community organizations that can act as partners by opening their doors to the public and those in need of refuge. COSI, for example, is providing 1,000 vouchers for distribution to children and families to visit the museum during heat advisory events.\n \nThis funding establishes a limited pot of money that can be used for grant making purposes (up to $5,000) to organizations that serve as cooling or heating centers in 2025 (and during the winter months of early 2026). It also authorizes the distribution of food and beverage for any partners that utilize these funds by offering their space to residents during weather events.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to ensure that funds are available for distribution during the remaining summer months.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with various community organizations in support of extreme weather programming; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order from and including June 1, 2025; and to declare an emergency. ($129,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, extreme weather events during the summer and the winter represent a threat to the well-being of residents who may not have reliable access to safe conditions; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council has established funding in the 2025 operating budget to offer ongoing support for community organizations that can act as partners by opening their doors to the public and those in need of refuge; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in that it is immediately necessary to authorize support for community agencies in that heating and cooling centers will help to preserve the health, safety, and welfare of residents of the city during the hot summer months, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 7. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 8.
