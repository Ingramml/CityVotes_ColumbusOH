    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Urban Land Institute (ULI) Columbus in support of the organization’s Real Estate Development Program, or REDI.\n \nREDI is a comprehensive, 12-session curriculum designed to advance the real estate careers of emerging developers and traditionally underrepresented groups. Participants step into the role of a real estate developer, gaining direct knowledge and experience working in teams to produce a development plan, pro-forma, and marketing plan for a real project. Participants are taught by a volunteer faculty of experienced, multidisciplinary, top-tier practicing real estate professionals serving as instructors, mentors and facilitators who share market-based knowledge and the wisdom from their experience. The program concludes with REDI teams presenting their proposals to a panel of real estate professionals who engage the participants and provide constructive feedback. \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes funds to be advanced to Urban Land Institute Columbus in order for the organization to acquire the resources necessary to execute the program. Furthermore, ULI Columbus intends to distribute food and beverages to attendees participating in the curriculum, which Council deems to serve a public purpose in that it is necessary to accommodate attendees’ dietary needs.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds are available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide the necessary resources to ULI Columbus to initiate the program without delay.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Urban Land Institute (ULI) Columbus in support of the organization’s Real Estate Development Program; to authorize an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the payment of reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses; and to declare an emergency.
