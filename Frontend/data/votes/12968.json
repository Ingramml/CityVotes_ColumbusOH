    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThe City of Columbus, through its Department of Technology (DoT), is in the process of modernizing its enterprise-wide network infrastructure to support long-term security, scalability, and resilience. This effort is being conducted under the strategic framework of a Zero Trust Network (ZTN), which prioritizes secure device authentication, network segmentation, and consistent configurations across City facilities.\nTo support this multi-year effort, AECOM has been engaged under the State of Ohio OST contract as an Owner’s Representative, providing essential expertise in project planning, network architecture, device authentication, and phased implementation strategies. Their work has included conducting technical assessments, producing a master asset inventory, supporting the replacement of legacy hardware, and serving as liaison between City stakeholders, Cisco, and CDW-G.\nAECOM’s performance to date has demonstrated a deep understanding of the City’s unique technical environment, stakeholder needs, and operational processes. It is therefore in the best interest of the City to directly contract with AECOM for a two-year term, aligned with the ZTN implementation period. This ordinance provides first-year funding only.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe funds for this expenditure have been identified and are available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund, Fund 5100 for a total cost of $500,000.00.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency passage is requested to enable timely implementation of this critical network infrastructure beginning this summer, ensuring both continued network security and the ability to take advantage of favorable lease terms.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name:  AECOM Services of Ohio Inc.\nVendor Acct. #034998\nExpiration Date: 1/27/2027\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with AECOM Services of Ohio Inc. for networking and Zero Trust implementation support services; to authorize the expenditure of $500,000.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services operating fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency. ($500,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Technology is undertaking a major transformation of its network systems under a Zero Trust Network (ZTN) model, designed to enhance cybersecurity, asset management, and network efficiency across over 250 City locations; and\nWHEREAS, AECOM, a nationally recognized infrastructure and technology consulting firm, is currently engaged by the City under the OST agreement and has played a critical role in the initial phases of the ZTN initiative; and\nWHEREAS, AECOM’s scope of services includes comprehensive program management for the City’s Zero Trust Network (ZTN) implementation. This encompasses oversight of both vendor and City technical resources, coordination across departments and stakeholders, management of project schedules and dependencies, and facilitation of executive-level reporting. AECOM will also support the City through independent verification and validation (IV&V) of architecture decisions, security control implementation, and vendor deliverables to ensure alignment with City objectives and industry best practices. Their role further includes reviewing network configurations, developing a citywide asset inventory, assessing Cisco recommendations, and preparing phased segmentation and authentication strategies; and\nWHEREAS, AECOM’s prior engagement gives them extensive institutional knowledge of the City’s systems, team members, goals, and constraints, which makes them uniquely positioned to continue their support without delay or disruption; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code and enter into direct contract with AECOM in order to continue the timely and uninterrupted execution of the ZTN strategy; and\nWHEREAS, the two-year term of the contract corresponds with the planned implementation period for ZTN, with this ordinance authorizing funding for only the first year of services; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize this contract to maintain project momentum and avoid delays in this critical infrastructure modernization effort, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare; and now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Technology is hereby authorized to enter into contract with AECOM Services of Ohio Inc.for professional consulting and program management services related to Zero Trust implementation, including oversight of internal and external project resources, coordination of vendor activities, and independent verification and validation of technical deliverables, for a term of two (2) years, with this ordinance authorizing funding for the first year only.\nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $500,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized to be expended as shown in the attachment to this ordinance. (Please see 2095-2025EXP - AECOM)\nSECTION 3. That the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 are hereby waived as it is in the City’s best interest to contract directly with AECOM Services of Ohio Inc.due to their ongoing work, subject matter expertise, and familiarity with the City’s systems, network infrastructure, and strategic objectives.\nSECTION 4: That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5: That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.
