The incentive was granted in consideration of GRANTEE’s total proposed investment of approximately $189 million, which included renovations of an existing facility that consists of approximately 60,000 square feet, construction of a 6-story community ambulatory center on the corner of Grant and Livingston Avenues, construction of a 6-story office facility on the SE corner of Parson and Livingston Avenues that consists of approximately 120,000 square feet, construction of a 2-story central energy plant that consists of approximately 30,000 square feet, construction of interior roadways, a small park, and a clinical building with an adjoining parking garage. In addition, the GRANTEE proposed to retain 11,948 full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $584,217,791.00 and the creation 1,500 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated estimated annual payroll of approximately $75 million (the “PROJECT”) at 700 Children’s Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43205 and the surrounding areas mentioned in the aforementioned paragraph (the “PROJECT SITE”). The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective October 16, 2017.\n \nThe GRANTEE also drafted a community strategic plan as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding, (MOU).  In accordance with the MOU, the GRANTEE proposed to invest  approximately $5.75 million in community development, which included the following: $2.8 million to the City’s Infant Mortality efforts over no more than five (5) years and $2.2 million toward FutureReady Columbus over no more than five (5) years after the approval of the strategic plan was approved for the entity; and $750,000.00 was proposed for housing development within the Healthy Neighborhoods, Healthy Families Zone, with special attention to the Southside.  \n \nIn a meeting between the City of Columbus, Department of Development (“Economic Development”) and GRANTEE on March 20, 2025, and through additional correspondence, the GRANTEE confirmed that additional investments will be made at the PROJECT SITE.  The GRANTEE is proposing to invest approximately $1.27 billion in a 5-project intensive care expansion project which includes the following: (i) construction of a new 14-story 900,000 square foot Acute Care facility, (ii) construction of a new 45,000 square foot energy plant, (iii) a 10,000 square foot loading dock extension, (iv) construction of a new 170 space underground parking garage, and (v) renovation of the Ann Wolf Inpatient facility consisting of approximately 40,000 square feet.  Additionally, the GRANTEE proposes to create 7,500 net new full-time permanent positions over a 15-year extension period.  These net new jobs will include a mixture of job categories including: allied health services, management and executive positions, nursing, physicians, professional staff, research and support positions, with an average salary of over $67,000.00 per employee as of report year 2024. As a result, the GRANTEE is requesting the AGREEMENT be amended to extend the incentive term from “January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2031” to January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2039” and to revise the annual incentive caps listed in the AGREEMENT. \n \nAs a result of the proposed aforementioned expansion project, Economic Development has offered to extend the incentive term of the AGREEMENT by fifteen (15) years beginning with calendar year 2025, and to revise the annual incentive caps from “$1.5 million for the first (8) years and $2.0 million for the last seven (7) years, and not to exceed a total of $15 million over the incentive term” to “capped annually at $3.0 million for first five (5) years of the extension term and $3.5 million for the last ten (10) years of the extension term beginning with calendar 2025.  The GRANTEE has accepted the revised incentive offer by Economic Development, and now therefore, an amendment to the AGREEMENT is now required. \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time to (i) revise the incentive term of the AGREEMENT, and (ii) to revise the annual incentive caps listed in the AGREEMENT.  \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital Inc. and its affiliated entities, including but not limited to, Pediatric Academic Association (i) to extend the incentive term and (ii) to revise the annual incentive caps in the agreement.
