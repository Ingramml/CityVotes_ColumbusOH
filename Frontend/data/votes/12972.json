    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Ordinance No. 1224-2009 established a tax increment financing (TIF) area pursuant to Ohio R.C. Section 5709.40(B) around the OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital (the “OhioHealth TIF”). Pursuant to Ordinance No. 1689-2009 and Ordinance No. 1020-2016, the City and OhioHealth entered into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement dated June 1, 2011, as amended by its First Amendment dated September 23, 2016 (together, the “OhioHealth TIF Agreement”). The City is now in the process of partnering with the Central Ohio Transit Authority to develop bus rapid transit from Downtown Columbus to Dublin including along Olentangy River Road (the “Northwest BRT Corridor”) where Riverside Methodist Hospital is located. The City has implemented ZoneIn Phase 1 and is implementing ZoneIn Phase 2 to allow for higher density residential and mixed-use developments along parts of the Northwest BRT Corridor. In addition, two separate projects have been proposed along the Northwest BRT Corridor within the OhioHealth TIF for which Continental Development Ventures, LLC and Crawford Hoying, Ltd. have respectively requested tax increment financing to support public infrastructure improvements as allowed under R.C. Section 5709.40(A)(8). OhioHealth has agreed to allow the parcels in the two new projects to be removed from the OhioHealth TIF and placed into the two new proposed TIFs.  \n \nThis Ordinance will authorize an amendment to both the OhioHealth TIF and the OhioHeath TIF Agreement for such aforementioned purposes. This Ordinance will also establish a new tax increment financing area at 3654 Olentangy River Road on Franklin County Tax Parcel ID No. 010-126692 (the “Olentangy 315 North TIF”) pursuant to R.C. Sections 5709.40(B), 5709.42, 5709.43. The proposed Olentangy 315 North TIF will provide for a one-hundred percent (100%) exemption from real property taxation on the improvements to the parcel(s) within such TIF for a concurrent period for all parcel(s) of not more than thirty (30) years. Columbus City Schools will receive, in the same manner as usual, all amounts they would have received in real property taxes had the tax exemption herein not been granted. Annual service payments in lieu of taxes will be made by the owner(s) of each parcel with respect to the improvements to the Olentangy 315 North TIF parcel(s). The applicable portion of those service payments in lieu of taxes will be distributed directly to the school district described herein, and the remaining portion of those service payments in lieu of taxes will be paid to the City for deposit into the appropriate TIF fund established by this Ordinance to be used to finance public infrastructure improvements, as allowed under R.C. Section 5709.40(A)(8), benefiting the Olentangy 315 North TIF parcel(s). A companion ordinance is being submitted for City Council consideration to remove additional parcels from the Olentangy & North Broadway TIF created pursuant to Ordinance No. 2189-2011 to combine those parcels with some of the parcels removed from the OhioHealth TIF hereunder to create a new TIF for the other project.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation. The City is foregoing one-hundred percent (100%) of the real property tax revenue that it would have received from the improvements within the new Olentangy 315 North TIF. Instead, the non-school portion of that revenue will be diverted to a new Olentangy 315 North TIF Fund.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize a second amendment to the TIF Agreement with OhioHealth; to amend Ordinance No. 1224-2009 to remove certain tax parcels exempted by that ordinance from the OhioHealth TIF; to create the Olentangy 315 North TIF with one of those removed parcels; to declare the improvements to the Olentangy 315 North TIF parcel(s) to be a public purpose and exempt from real property taxation; to require the owner(s) of the parcel(s) in the Olentangy 315 North TIF  to make service payments in lieu of taxes; to require the distribution of the applicable portion of those service payments to the Columbus City School District; to deposit the remainder of those service payments into the Olentangy 315 North TIF Fund for financing public infrastructure improvements as allowed under R.C. Section 5709.40(A)(8).  ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.40(B) and Ordinance No. 1224-2009, City Council created a tax increment financing (TIF) area around the OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital (the “OhioHealth TIF”); and\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance No. 1689-2009 and Ordinance No. 1020-2016, the City and OhioHealth entered into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement dated June 1, 2011, as amended by its First Amendment dated September 23, 2016 (together, the “OhioHealth TIF Agreement”); and\n \nWHEREAS, the City is now in the process of partnering with the Central Ohio Transit Authority to develop bus rapid transit from Downtown Columbus to Dublin including along Olentangy River Road (the “Northwest BRT Corridor”) where Riverside Methodist Hospital is located; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City has implemented ZoneIn Phase 1 and is implementing ZoneIn Phase 2 to allow for higher density residential and mixed-use developments along parts of the Northwest BRT Corridor; and \n \nWHEREAS, two separate projects have been proposed along the Northwest BRT Corridor within the OhioHealth TIF (the “Northwest BRT Projects”) for which Continental Development Ventures, LLC and Crawford Hoying, Ltd. have requested tax increment financing to support public infrastructure improvements benefiting the proposed projects as allowed under R.C. Section 5709.40(A)(8); and\n \nWHEREAS, OhioHealth has agreed to allow the parcels of the Northwest BRT Projects to be removed from the OhioHealth TIF and placed into the new proposed separate TIFs, which the two new TIFs will provide indirect support towards the creation of new housing units within the Northwest BRT Projects in close proximity to the hospital for possible occupancy by OhioHealth employees; and \n \nWHEREAS, to maximize the tax increment financing available for the Northwest BRT Projects and the public infrastructure projects as described on Exhibit B attached hereto (the “Public Infrastructure Improvements”), OhioHealth and the City have determined that it is in their best interests to remove the applicable parcels of the Northwest BRT Projects from the OhioHeath TIF, amend the OhioHealth TIF Agreement for the second time, and add the parcels of the Northwest BRT Projects (and additional adjacent parcels for one of the projects) to new TIFs; and\n \nWHEREAS, R.C. Sections 5709.40(B), 5709.42, and 5709.43 (collectively, the “TIF Statutes”) authorize this Council, by ordinance, to declare the improvement to parcels of real property located within the City to be a public purpose and exempt from taxation, require the owner of each parcel to make service payments in lieu of taxes, provide for the distribution of the applicable portion of such service payments in lieu of taxes to the school district in which those parcels are located and to the City, establish a municipal public improvement tax increment equivalent fund for the deposit of those non-school service payments in lieu of taxes, and specify the purposes for which money in that fund will be expended; and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to pay for the costs of the Public Infrastructure Improvements, this Council has determined that it is necessary and appropriate and in the best interest of the City to establish a tax increment financing area at 3654 Olentangy River Road on Franklin County Tax Parcel ID No. 010-126692 as depicted on Exhibit C attached hereto (the “Olentangy 315 North TIF”) to exempt from taxation one-hundred percent (100%) of the improvements to each parcel of real property within the Olentangy 315 North TIF (collectively the “Parcels” and each a “Parcel”) as permitted and provided in R.C. 5709.40(B) for up to a thirty (30) year concurrent period for all Parcels and to simultaneously direct and require the current and future owners of each Parcel (each individually an “Owner” and collectively the “Owners”) to make annual payments in lieu of taxes, in the same amount as they would have made real property tax payments but for the exemptions provided by this Ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City has determined that the applicable portion of the service payments in lieu of taxes shall be paid directly to Columbus City Schools (the “School District”) in an amount equal to the real property taxes that the School District would have been paid if the improvement to each Parcel located within the School District had not been exempt from taxation pursuant to this Ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.43(A), this Council has determined to establish a municipal public improvement tax increment equivalent fund in which there shall be deposited the appropriate remaining non-school service payments in lieu of taxes distributed to the City as provided herein; and\n \nWHEREAS, notice of this proposed Ordinance has been delivered to the Board of Education of the School District in accordance with and within the time periods prescribed in R.C. Sections 5709.40 and 5709.83, respectively; and\n \nWHEREAS, a companion ordinance is being submitted for City Council consideration to remove additional parcels from the Olentangy & North Broadway TIF created pursuant to Ordinance No. 2189-2011 to combine those parcels with some of the parcels removed from the OhioHealth TIF hereunder to create a new TIF for the other project.; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.                     TIF Amendments.
