    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Marker, Inc. dba Marker Construction to provide construction services associated with the Marion Franklin Pool Replacement Project. The modification amount is $9,268,376.00, with an additional $10,500.00 for interdepartmental inspections and fees, for a total of $9,278,876.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department is delivering this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) format and this modification will allow progress to the next phase of building this facility. The previous ordinances allowed for the design phase and pre-construction phase of the project to be completed. They also initiated the procurement of long lead time materials, including pumps, filters chemical storage systems, and electrical equipment. This portion of the project will include additional professional services and full construction of the new facility. This is a planned modification that will allow construction of the project to be completed in time for the 2026 swim season.\n \nThe original completion date of the project was May 24, 2026. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will remain May 24, 2026.  \nAmount of Additional Funds: $9,278,876.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: This modification was foreseen due to the nature of Construction Manager at Risk contracts. This modification covers the scope for construction of the project.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: All of the scope associated with this vendor's contract modification was planned as part of the original project scope. The project was broken into phases and contract modifications to align with the Construction Manager at Risk project delivery method.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The price for additional services was determined by the vendor providing anticipated construction costs for the construction team.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMarker, Inc. dba Marker Construction\n2011 Riverside Drive                                                      \nColumbus, Ohio 43201\nGary Schmitt, (614) 754-8349                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 006989\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 27, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that work can be completed prior to the 2026 swim season.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will benefit the public by improving an important recreational facility that has served the community for over 50 years.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Through the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan, residents in the service area have been engaged through their associations and commissions.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far South (64)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department's Master Plan by improving existing aquatics facilities while helping to ensure that facilities remain safe and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $3,000,000.00 was legislated for the Marion Franklin Pool Replacement Project by Ordinance 0672-2025. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $9,278,876.00. $9,278,876.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $12,278,876.00. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Marker, Inc. dba Marker Construction for the Marion Franklin Pool Replacement Project to add additinal funding; to authorize the transfer of $9,278,876.00 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $9,278,876.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $9,278,876.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
