    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Marker, Inc. dba Marker Construction for the Case Road Park - CMR Project. The contract amount of $8,000,000.00 is being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThis $8,000,000.00 cost is the second of anticipated authorizations that will ultimately fund the construction of this park and its facilities.  With a Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) contract and completed construction plans, Columbus Recreation and Parks negotiates a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the project delivery.  This authorization is part of that total GMP, which the CMR cannot exceed.  Once the GMP is determined, the final modification to this contract will be requested for its remainder.  The anticipated budget for the Project is $18,000,000.00.  This authorization will allow for site construction to start this fall. \n \nIn 2018, Recreation and Parks acquired the former Ohio State University Agriculture Extension Sheep Farm at 2425 West Case Road. For several years, the department had identified the 58 acre site as a key community park space, as the parcel is one of the largest remaining undeveloped open spaces in the entire Northwest Community. At the same time, the surrounding neighborhoods have played an active role by providing support for the City’s investment to buy the site and develop a signature green space for an underserved area. The property is surrounded by a high density of housing, with over 1,000 households within a 10 minute walk. The Carriage Place Community Center is also within 200 yards of the parkland.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department proposes to deliver the Case Road Park Project using a CMR. This method will provide an efficient delivery in this labor and material market. With the design being approximately 90% complete, early procurement continues to be proposed of long lead time materials such as electrical gear, building materials, site amenities, and roofing.  Furthermore, construction activities will begin when permits start getting approved for this project in fall 2025.\n \nThe central core of the property will feature a community park with both active and passive amenities. These include sports fields, playgrounds, sports courts, walking trails, meadows, and naturalized areas with associated parking and other supporting infrastructure. A City of Columbus Forestry Outpost will occupy the northeast corner of the site. Area for a future Columbus Metropolitan Library branch will be reserved at the northwest corner of the property. Coordination between Columbus Recreation and Parks and the Columbus Metropolitan Library is ongoing, including potential cost sharing agreements for shared infrastructure.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 16, 2024 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 3, 2024. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nMarker, Inc. dba Marker Construction\nThe Ruhlin Company\nSetterlin\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Marker, Inc. dba Marker Construction was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Marker, Inc. dba Marker Construction and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMarker, Inc. dba Marker Construction\n2011 Riverside Drive                                                    \nColumbus, Ohio 43201\nMike Girouard, (614) 736-1019                                                  \nContract Compliance Number: 006989\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 27, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that funding is in place for site construction to begin in fall 2025 to avoid escalation of costs in the current labor and material market. \n \nBenefits to the Public: West Case Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the northwest region of Columbus. The scale of this park will accommodate a wide range of passive and active recreation for all ages. The park will be designed to maximize walking and biking access, taking advantage of the close proximity to Carriage Place Community Center.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since 2017, the local communities have been extensively engaged with the Recreation and Parks Department in the acquisition and development of this greenspace. The Department has engaged with the Northwest Civic Association.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Northwest (34)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality parks and trails, while adding easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages.\n \nFiscal Impact: $8,000,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Marker, Inc. dba Marker Construction for the Case Road Park Project; to authorize the transfer of $8,000,000.00 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $8,000,000.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $8,000,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
