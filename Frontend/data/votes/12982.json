    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with E. L. Robinson Engineering of Ohio Co. to provide construction services associated with the Big Walnut Trail - Refugee Road to East Main Street - Stage 2 Phase 1 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $1,500,000.00.\n \nThis is a planned legislative request for Stage 2 of the central section of the Big Walnut Trail. This section includes 3.5 miles of 10 foot asphalt trail from Nafzger Park on Refugee Road to the north end of Big Walnut Park at East Main Street. The central reach of the Big Walnut Trail is developing into one of the region’s most scenic and accessible greenways in Central Ohio. It will put thousands of residents of the Mid East, South East, and Far East Communities within a few minutes access to the regional trail network.  \n \nThis project has been awarded $7,483,914.00 from Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) Attributable Funds towards construction in the 2028 fiscal year. The extension begins in Nafzger Park, along Big Walnut Creek at Refugee Road. From there, the trail will head north along Big Walnut Creek and the Noe Bixby Road corridor, passing beneath I-270, Norfolk Southern Railroad, and I-70 to a proposed stream crossing into Big Walnut Park. The trail then uses the existing one mile trail ending north of Livingston Avenue. The final segment will head north through Big Walnut Parkland to the northern terminus on the south side of East Main Street at the Fairway Boulevard signal crossing. The project will also provide connection to the Walnut Heights, Pine Hills, and Shady Lane Neighborhoods.\n \nOrdinance 2015-2024 authorized Stage 1, which encompassed preliminary engineering, environmental studies, and community outreach. The Stage 2 contract modification is structured into two phases to allow the consultant to advance the project while the City awaits capital fund replenishment from the upcoming bond sale.\n \nThe Stage 2 scope of work includes detailed design of the trail, associated structures, and trailheads. It also includes securing all necessary local, state, and federal permits required for complete construction documentation.\n \nPhase 1 of Stage 2 will proceed under a negotiated scope with a funding cap of $1,500,000.00. Phase 2 will provide the remaining funds necessary to complete the full Stage 2 scope. It is expected to be legislated in first quarter of 2026 when funding is available. A third planned modification in the third quarter of 2026 will be for construction administration services. Construction of the 3.5 mile central Big Walnut segment is projected to begin in the Ohio Department of Transportation’s 2028 fiscal year.\n \nThe original project completion date of the project was September 11, 2026. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will remain September 11, 2026.  \nAmount of Additional Funds: $1,500,000.00\nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: These additional services were foreseen. However, the level of effort required to complete the services was unknown at the time of initial contract scope and fee negotiation. As with all trail projects, a planned modification is included between preliminary engineering, stage 1, and detailed design, stage 2, to ensure the appropriate level of scope and fees are negotiated.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: The current contractor has in-depth understanding of the project needs and expertise in the specific nuances of the subject matter. As a result, modifying the current contract is more cost efficient than awarding the additional scope to a potentially different vendor through another procurement process. \n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The price for additional services was determined on negotiated scope based on established hourly rates in the original contract.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nE. L. Robinson Engineering of Ohio Co.\n950 Goodale Boulevard, Suite 180 \nGrandview Heights, Ohio 43212\nAngela Fedak, 614-586-0642 \nContract Compliance Number: 005858\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 19, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow Stage 2 work to begin as soon as possible so the grant funding requirements can be met.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Access to trails and key destinations is one of the top rated priorities noted by Columbus residents. This project will provide significant connectivity for residents in Mid East, South East and Far East area Communities by extending existing regional trail access to and through several parks and neighborhoods.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: As part of the MORPC grant application process, Recreation and Parks received dozens of letters of support for this project from the members of the community, including many students from Independence High School and the neighboring communities.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. The project will provide equitable and safe access to the trail system for under-served communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $692,000.00 was legislated for the Big Walnut Trail - Refugee Road to East Main Street Project by Ordinance 2015-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $1,500,000.00. $462,969.30 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of a portion of this expenditure. The remaining funds, in the amount of $1,037,030.70, will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed. There is a total of $1,500,000.00 available for this project. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $2,192,000.00.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with E.L. Robinson Engineering of Ohio Co. for the Big Walnut Trail - Refugee Road to East Main Street Project to add additional funding; to authorize the transfer of $1,037,030.70 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $462,969.30 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $1,037,030.70 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the transfer of $462,969.30 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $1,500,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund and Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
