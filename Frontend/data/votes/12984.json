    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  CelebrateOne has been awarded a grant by the Crane Family Foundation, which has been deposited into the CelebrateOne Community Fund at The Columbus Foundation. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $50,000.00 in grant money to support the work of CelebrateOne’s doula programs.  The Crane Family pledged a gift of $150,000.00 to be paid over three calendar years.  This ordinance accepts and appropriates the third and final of three years of grant funding. This ordinance also accepts and appropriates $119,381.14 in grant funds from the Columbus Foundation  into the Private Grant Fund for the housing work being done by CelebrateOne with Physicians CareConnection.  \nThis ordinance will allow CelebrateOne to enter into contract with different doula providers for $50,000.00 to further the work of doula programming as well as to enter into contract with Physicians Care Connection in the amount of $119,381.14 for housing stabilization services.\n \nPhysician CareConnection (PCC) is a trusted nonprofit organization with deep expertise in addressing housing instability and navigating housing support systems; CelebrateOne has an existing contract with PCC specifically for housing related services.  These services provided by PCC cannot be effectively replicated by internal City resources. \n \nVendor Information:\nPhysicians Care Connection, Vendor Number 005206, CC-005206 \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is requested at this time in order allow these services to continue without interruption or a lapse in services to the women and families that CelebrateOne services.\n \nWAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING:  A new contract with Physicians CareConnection (PCC) is necessary to continue the work already underway with up to sixty (60) client families. Physicians CareConnection is a non-profit entity already providing the same housing services for pregnant and homeless families in the Columbus area.  Advertising for a new vendor to provide these services is manifestly impractical as the housing and housing stabilization services are already underway and clients are presently enrolled in the programs.  Advertising and selecting a new vendor would unnecessarily cause delays in housing the clients and would likely exceed the costs negotiated with Physicians CareConnection.  PCC has the necessary skills and experience to continue the work.  A contract with Physicians CareConnection was negotiated by CelebrateOne.  This new contract with Physicians CareConnection requires the waiving of the City's Code Chapter 329 as it pertains to advertising, evaluating, and awarding professional services contracts due to the urgency of getting a qualified housing assistance firm to oversee the program as it relates to homelessness in Central Ohio.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program activity is funded by private contributions to the CelebrateOne Community Fund at The Columbus Foundation and does not generate revenue nor require a City match. A deposit of $169,381.14 will be made to the City's Private Grant Fund 2291, G401901 after passage of this ordinance.  \n  \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the CelebrateOne Executive Director to accept and appropriate grant funds from the Crane Family Foundation through the CelebrateOne Community Fund at The Columbus Foundation to the City's Private Grant Fund for support of CelebrateOne doula programs in the amount of $50,000.00; and to accept and appropriate funds from the CelebrateOne Community Fund at the Columbus Foundation for the support of housing stabilization services; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $169,381.14 from the City's Private Grants Fund for doula work and housing stabilization services as well as to form contracts with doula providers and Physicians CareConnection; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency.  ($169,381.14) \n  \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $50,000.00 in grant funds have been made available to CelebrateOne from the Crane Family Foundation through the CelebrateOne Community Fund at the Columbus Foundation for CelebrateOne Doula programs; and,\n \nWHEREAS, $119,381.14 in grant funds have been made available to CelebrateOne from the CelebrateOne Community Fund at the Columbus Foundation for housing stabilization services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Executive Director of CelebrateOne is authorized to accept $50,000.00 in private grant funds from the Crane Family Foundation from the CelebrateOne Community Fund at the Columbus Foundation for use in funding doula services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Executive Director of CelebrateOne is authorized to accept $119,381.14 in private grant funds from the CelebrateOne Community Fund at the Columbus Foundation for use in funding housing stabilization services with Physicians CareConnection; and\n \nWHEREAS, the $169,381.14 must be encumbered in the City's Private Grant Fund 2291; G401901, and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the City's best interests to waive the competitive bidding requirement of Columbus City Code in order to utilize these funds to award service agreements and expend $50,000.00 for doula programming and to award a service agreement and expend $119,381.14 with Physicians CareConnection for housing stabilization services as previously setup by Ord 0894-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is being submitted as an emergency measure to allow the financial transactions to be posted in the City’s accounting system as soon as possible so that timely services can begin; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of CelebrateOne in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds to allow these financial transactions to be posted in the City’s accounting system in order to meet project timelines and deliverables as soon as possible, to ensure no lapse in home stabilization services for expecting and new parents, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $50,000.00 from the Crane Family Foundation through the CelebrateOne Fund at The Columbus Foundation as well as $119,381.14 from the CelebrateOne Fund at the Columbus Foundation. \n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the fund known as the City's Private Grants Fund 2291, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources for the period ending December 31, 2025, the sum of $50,000.00 is hereby appropriated per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance upon receipt of the $50,000.00 by the Treasurer of the City of Columbus.\n \nSECTION 3.  That from the unappropriated monies in the fund known as the City's Private Grants Fund 2291, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources for the period ending December 31, 2025, the sum of $119,381.14 is hereby appropriated per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance by the Treasurer of the City of Columbus.\n \nSECTION 4.
