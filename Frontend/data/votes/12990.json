    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Columbus City Attorney’s Office to enter into contract with MDDR Enterprises Incorporated (vendor # 033102) and Lindsay Automotive Inc. (vendor # 004376) for vehicle maintenance and/or repair services for the city’s Project Taillight public service program. \n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention program offers low-income residents access to free vehicle repairs. These repairs keep drivers, passengers and pedestrians safer on the roads and prevent low-income residents from receiving tickets for safety code violations. Project Taillight started as a two-year, grant funded pilot and with the partnership of Columbus City Council, is now a fully-funded program that assists with several different kinds of car repairs for residents.\n \nPROCUREMENT:\nIn accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office solicited Best Value Procurement bids for auto repair services through the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from February 20th through March 24th, 2025 (solicitation #RFQ029673). The city attorney sought to identify up to five (5) repair partners located in high-need neighborhoods across Columbus. However, only two (2) bids were received. These proposals were evaluated and scored by the review committee using the rubric outlined in the solicitation. Both the Lindsay Automotive, Inc. and MDDR Enterprises Incorporated applications were deemed responsive with both vendors demonstrating a clear understanding of project work and meeting all partner requirements. \n \nBoth contracts will be for seventeen months (May 1st, 2025 through December 31st, 2026) with a twelve-month renewal option. NOTE: Funding is contingent on availability within the budget, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of Columbus City Council and certification of funds by the Columbus City Auditor.\n \nINDEFINITE QUANTITY SERVICE CONTRACT JUSTIFICATION:\nThe City Attorney made a conscious decision to work with multiple service vendors for the Project Taillight program. Working through multiple locations increases access for program participants and allows the city to invest in multiple business partners serving our diverse resident population. Each approved partner contractually commits to the same labor rate and parts discount (see rates in attached BVP). Because eligible participants are referred to the repair shop that is most convenient for them, the project team is unable to determine how many vehicles will be serviced through each vendor location. Therefore, individual contracts will not be assigned budget caps. Rather, purchase agreements will be set up for each Project Taillight vendor in our system that will draw from a single $250,000 encumbrance. The Columbus City Attorney’s Office will monitor the Project Taillight account and stop referring participants for services when available funds are no longer sufficient to cover repairs.\n \nVENDOR:\n§                     Lindsay Automotive Inc. | CC-004376 | expires 6/18/2027\n§                     MDDR Enterprises Incorporated | CC-033102 | expires 2/11/2027\n \nThese companies do not hold Minority Business Enterprise of Women Business Enterprise status.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nTotal appropriation is $250,000.00 and is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION:\nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide the funds necessary to continue and expand the Project Taillight pilot and provide residents with needed repairs to their vehicles, without interruption.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to enter into two contracts with Lindsay Automotive, Inc and MDDR Enterprises Incorporated for the purpose of supporting and expanding the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention program; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $250,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
