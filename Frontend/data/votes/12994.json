    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for general construction services with Complete General Construction Company for the 2021 General Construction Contract project, CIP #610500-100005 & 650745-100013, to add additional funds in an amount up to $1,000,000.00 for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Misc Improvements- HCWP Sludge Line Condition Assessment and Improvements, CIP #690286-100000.\n \nThis contract was initiated to respond to emergency needs and miscellaneous structural repairs and installations as directed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.  Two sources of funding were established:  one source for sanitary sewers; and one source for storm sewers.  The Division of Water declined to participate in the contract when it was originally bid, planning to cover their needs in other ways.  It has since been determined the Division of Water does need a contract to handle these needs.  Contract modification #1, authorized by Ordinance 0617-2025, passed by City Council on 3/31/25, added the Division of Water to this contract and authorized the first Division of Water contract task.  The Division of Water will modify the contract to add funding for any future tasks.\nThis contract modification is to add funding for the Division of Water to perform HCWP Misc. Improvements- HCWP Sludge Line Condition Assessment and Improvements project, CIP #690286-100000.  The Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) has experienced a decrease in sludge pumping capacity due to sludge build-up in the force main and potentially other issues inside the force main.  A force main is a water line that uses pumps to move liquid instead of using a gravity feed because a gravity feed has insufficient force.  The reduced pumping capacity requires additional sludge to be diverted to the onsite lagoons, which increases HCWP’s operating cost.  An assessment and modification to the force main are needed quickly to restore sludge pumping capacity and avoid additional increased operating costs.   \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,000,000.00\n \nCost Summary\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $5,233,635.50 (ORD 3039-2023; PO431061 and PO431109)\nModification #1                                                               $2,500,000.00 (ORD 0617-2025, PO506522, PO506525, & PO506532)\nModification #2                                                               $1,000,000.00 (This ordinance)\n \nContract Total:                                                                $8,733,635.50\n \n1.2 Reason other procurement processes are not used:    \nThis contract was awarded via the City’s IFB process for emergency and unplanned needs.  This ordinance is adding funding to the current contract to continue these needs.  Another procurement process is not needed.  \n \n1.3 How cost of renewal/modification was determined:\nConstruction services will continue to be provided per the original contract pricing.\n \n1.4 Timeline\nThere is no change to the original contract timeline.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis contract allows an immediate response to emergency and unplanned needs.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nComplete General Construction Company’s contract compliance number is CC006056 and expires 4/5/27.\n \nAs part of their original contract, Complete General Construction Company proposed no subcontractors will be used for this project.\n \nThe certification of the Complete General Construction was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $1,000,000.00 are available and appropriated for this expenditure within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006. A transfer of funds and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund is necessary to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects. \n \n5.  Emergency Designation\nEmergency designation is requested as the diversion of the sludge build-up is increasing the operating costs of the plant and decreasing the capacity of the storage lagoons.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify the contract with Complete General Construction Company for the 2021 General Construction Contract project; to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund; to authorize an expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 to pay for the contract modification; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,000,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the 2021 General Construction Contract project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3039-2023 authorized a contract with Complete General Construction Company for the 2021 General Construction Contract project; and  \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0617-2025 authorized contract modification #1 to this contract to add funds for Storm and Sanitary and to add the Division of Water to the contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Complete General Construction Company for the 2021 General Construction Contract project to add funding and to enable the Division of Water to add a task to the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, a transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds from the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006 to pay for the contract modification; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify an existing contract with Complete General Construction Company to add additional funding to cover the cost m requiring this sludge problem to be diagnosed and remedied as quickly as possible as the diversion of the sludge build-up is increasing the operating costs of the plant and decreasing the capacity of the storage lagoons, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the transfer of $1,000,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to enter into a construction services contract modification for the 2021 General Construction Contract project with Complete General Construction Company, 1221 East Fifth Ave. Columbus, OH 43219, in an amount up to $1,000,000.00, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Department of Public Utilities.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $1,000,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized to pay for this contract per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is made a part hereof, this Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten (10) days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes this Ordinance.",
