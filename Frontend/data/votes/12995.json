    "description": "Explanation\n1.  Background  \nThe Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Southerly Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements project (CIP 650377-100000).  This ordinance authorizes the acquisition of property in an amount up to $25,000,000.00 needed to build a levee to protect the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant from flooding. \n \nThe Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) is located within a floodplain at 6977 S. High Street, Lockbourne, Ohio.  The Southerly Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements project is to create a phased development storm water master plan for the SWWTP to mitigate the threat of flood damage to the plant, then design and construct the needed improvements.  One of the identified necessary improvements is to construct a levee to protect the SWWTP from a 500 year flood event.  Property has been identified for acquisition next to the SWWTP that is needed to properly locate the levee.  The property is currently owned by Kenmore Construction Co., Inc., and they have agreed to sell this property to the City.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development and/or the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those documents necessary to acquire this real property.   \n \n2.  Fiscal Impact\nThe $25,000,000.00 needed for the land acquisition is to be funded from three sources:\n \n2.1 Storm Bond Funds\nA transfer of cash and appropriation in an amount up to $2,500,000.00 is needed within the Storm Bond Fund, Fund 6204, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \n2.2 Sanitary Bond Funds \nA transfer of cash and appropriation in an amount up to $10,633,800.38 is needed within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \n2.3 Certification Against Sanitary Reserves\nThe balance of the funding needed for the land acquisition is to come from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102.  A transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, in an amount up to $11,866,199.62, is needed to fund construction for this purchase.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a bond sale is held and the loan can be repaid with proceeds from the bond sale.  The funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred to Fund 6109 and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development and/or the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those documents necessary to acquire fee simple title and lesser interests to property located adjacent to the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant located at 6977 S.
