    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1 project, CIP #650724-100000, in an amount up to $3,974,363.79.\n \nProfessional construction management services are needed to ensure construction of the Lower Olentangy Tunnel follows the requirements and specifications of the project design and that the City receives an end product capable of providing the intended function.  Existing City staff are not adequate to devote multiple qualified personnel full time to management of the project construction activities. These activities include full time construction inspection, project coordination, reporting, budgeting, scheduling, document tracking, and startup coordination.   Much of the project alignment generally follows Olentangy River Road.  This is a planned contract modification to add funds to continue the work.\n \nThe project is in the Citywide Community Planning Area #99.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $3,974,363.79\nOriginal Contract                                           $4,174,157.47 (ORD 0247-2020; PO221727) \n                     Mod. No. 1                                       $4,707,574.39 (ORD 0336-2022; PO324143)\n                     Mod. No. 2                                       $4,933,165.65 (ORD 0761-2023; PO396061)\n                     Mod. No. 3                                         $5,072,270.32 (ORD 1075-2024; PO452672)\n                     Mod. No. 4 (current)             $3,974,363.79\n                     Mod. No. 5 (estimated)     $   500,000.00\n                     TOTAL                                   $23,361,531.62\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process as a multi-year contract with planned renewals to add funding until the construction project is complete.  Another procurement process is not required. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work using established contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed the proposal and negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe project is part of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage’s 2015 Blueprint program which included significant outreach for the program.  The project will improve water quality in the Olentangy River by substantially reducing wet weather overflows from seven combined sewer overflow structures as well as three other sewer relief structures. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nBlack & Veatch Corporation’s contract compliance number is CC008038 and expires 8/22/25.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Black & Veatch Corporation has proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                             ODI Certification Status\nMarshWagner Inc.                                                             Columbus, Ohio                                                                              WBE\nAccenture, LLC                                            Columbus, Ohio                                                                               MAJ\n7NT Enterprises, LLC                                                                   Dublin, Ohio                                                                                        MBE\n \nThe certification of Black & Veatch Corporation and the above companies was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Black & Veatch Corporation or their subcontractors. \n \n4.
