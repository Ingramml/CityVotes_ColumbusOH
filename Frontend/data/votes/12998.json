    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with HDR Engineering Inc., for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project CIP # 650352-100008, in an amount up to $2,137,238.13.  \n \nThis original contract for this project provided preliminary design services for upgrades and improvements to the existing Odor Control Facility (OCF), the carbon Biotower and ventilation system serving the Sludge Loadout Building (SLB), and to the foul air fans at the Gravity Thickening Building (GTB) to improve odor control. These improvements will provide active ventilation, prevent corrosion, reduce foul air, and provide an Interconnector Junction Chamber (IJC) Odor Improvement Report on the IJC regarding the probability of success using existing OCF equipment to improve odor reduction or design a separate odor control facility for the IJC under a future contract.\n \nThis modification (modification number 1) will be for Step 2 - Detailed Design Services and will provide bidding and contract documents for the construction phase of this project. A future, second modification will be for Step 3 - Services during construction which includes technical field representation and other services throughout the construction phase of the project may be requested at the completion of Step 2 Services.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Columbus Community Areas 99- Citywide. \n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $2,137,238.13\nOriginal Contra                 $712,102.10 (ORD 1934-2023; PO406231)\nModification #1:                     $2,137,238.13 (current)\nModification #2:                $3,030,000.00 (future) Total                                $5,879,340.23\n  \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nModifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 1934-2023.  \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was bid using the City RFP process.  It was planned for multiple years with funding modifications.  This is one of the planned funding modifications.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between HDR Engineering, Inc. and the Department based upon the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe Odor Control Facility (OCF) has served the SWWTP for approximately 10 years; however recently SWWTP staff have expressed concerns about the increased maintenance of the facilities and questioned the overall system performance. An evaluation was performed and identified improvements to the OCF necessary to ensure continued performance and alleviate some of the increasing maintenance costs. The biofilters at the Influent Flow Structure have several areas with corrosion and cracking of concrete where the water is pooling. There is also deteriorating pipe due to UV exposure. The carbon biotower near the Sludge Loadout Building (SLB) is in a state of disrepair and in need of upgrade improvements. The foul air fans for the SLB are old and at the end of their useful life and need to be replaced. The Interconnector Junction Chamber (IJC) control gates are in a state of disrepair due to hydrogen sulfide gas corrosion of the metal, therefore improvements to the ventilation and hydrogen sulfide treatment are warranted. The repair and upgrade of each areas within this project will provide better, more reliable odor control and removal of environmentally hazardous gasses.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHDR Engineering Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC008851 and expires 3/11/2026.  \n \nAs part of their proposal, HDR Engineering Inc. has proposed the following four subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nDynotec Inc.                                                  Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nCAD Concepts Inc. dba CCI Engineering        Dublin, Ohio                                                                                             WBE   \nDHDC Engineering Consulting Services Inc.    Columbus, Ohio                                          MBE      \n \nHDR Engineering Inc.’s certification and all of the above companies was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against HDR Engineering, Inc.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2720-2024, passed by Council on 10/30/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA September 2025 Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved. \n \nFunds will need to be appropriated for this project in the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund, Fund 6111.  This is a reimbursement loan.  Invoices will need to be paid to HDR Engineering and then submitted to OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project; to appropriate funds within the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund; to make this ordinance contingent upon the Ohio Water Development Authority approving a loan for this project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,137,238.13 from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund to pay for the project.  ($2,137,238.13)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the SWWTP Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO406231 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1934-2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract modification is needed to add funding for continued engineering services during construction; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the professional engineering services agreement with HDR Engineering Inc. for the SWWTP Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2720-2024 authorized this project to be funded by a loan to be obtained through the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) Loan Account; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is contingent upon that loan being approved; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to appropriate and to expend funds from the from the Water Pollution Control Fund, Fund 6111 to pay for the contract modification; now, therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities is authorized to enter into a contract modification for the SWWTP Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project with HDR Engineering Inc. 8890 Lyra Drive, Suite 100, Columbus, OH 43240, for professional engineering services for the SWWTP Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project, CIP No. 650352-100008, in accordance with the terms and conditions as shown in the contract on file with the Department of Public Utilities, in an amount not to exceed $2,137,238.13.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the appropriation of $2,137,238.13, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund, Fund 6111, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 3.
