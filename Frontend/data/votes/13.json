    "title": "To authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various agreements with CMHA in order to finalize property rights and ownership at Barack Recreation Center, Champions Parkland, Sawyer Community Center, and Sullivant Gardens Community Center and Park; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into various agreements to finalize property rights and ownership of four (4) different locations at which the Recreation and Parks Department and Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) have standing partnerships with in working together for the community. The Recreation and Parks Department and CMHA have remained in partnership since the late 1970’s, providing community assets to the public for recreational opportunities. The four properties involved in this legislation have historical significance within the Recreation and Parks Department and the City of Columbus as a whole. This ordinance will allow the Recreation and Parks Department to finalize documents and enter into the various agreements with CMHA outlined herein. \n \nBarack Recreation Center:\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the acceptance a quitclaim deed for the real property rights and ownership to Barack Recreation Center, located at 580 Woodrow Ave, Columbus, Ohio 43207. The City constructed the building in 1963, in conjunction with CMHA, to help support the adjacent Lincoln Park CMHA Housing. The facility was renovated in 1999. Adjacent parcels acquired by private entities and the CMHA parcel were reverted back to the City in 2007. The Recreation and Parks Department currently operates the community center with active programming. The site has a pool, basketball courts, a playground, and a loop walk. The site is connected by green space to the Lincoln School.\n \nChampions Parkland:\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a Shared Use Agreement with CMHA for the parkland known as the Champions Parkland. This parkland is located at Champions Avenue and Hawthorne Avenue at the previous location of the former City of Columbus Champions Middle School. The Shared Use Agreement will allow CMHA, in coordination with the Recreation and Parks Department, to expend CHMA’s funding for improvements to Champions Parkland. This parkland was deeded to the Recreation and Parks Department in 2007 and has a long historical standing within the Poindexter and Mount Vernon Communities as a green space for recreational opportunities.\nRecreation and Parks maintains Champions Parkland as open green space and has not had capital funding identified for improvements to the parkland. CMHA has funding available to make improvements to this parkland, but use of the funding requires that a property interest be demonstrated in the Shared Use Agreement. CMHA has committed to working with the Recreation and Parks Department on the planning, design, and construction of the improvements to the Champions Parkland.\n \nSawyer Community Center:\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a Mutual Termination of Lease Agreement with CMHA for the property known as Sawyer Community Center, located at 1056 Atcheson St., Columbus, Ohio 43203, to release any leased rights or responsibilities to the CMHA owned property. Recreation and Parks entered into a lease agreement with CMHA in 1968 for the use of Sawyer Community Center and the facility was sublet to Neighborhood House in 1972. The lease expires April 9, 2045 as a result of two different 45 year agreements. Recreation and Parks has a one year lease agreement in place with Community for New Direction that expires in February 2021. No City of Columbus programs or staff currently work out of the facility and the facility is not currently being utilized by Recreation and Parks in any capacity. The facility is need of significant repairs. CMHA and Recreation and Parks have agreed to move forward with a terminating the lease in order to release Recreation and Parks of the facility burden, once the current tenant has been relocated.\n \nSullivant Gardens Community Center and Parkland:\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the acceptance a quitclaim deed for the real property rights and ownership to Sullivant Gardens Community Center and Parkland, located at 755 Renick St., Columbus, Ohio 43223. Recreation and Parks entered into a Lease Agreement in 1976 for a Lease Term of 40+ years.  Recreation and Parks has spent capital dollars to make improvements at this location and has continued to acquire adjacent parcels, most recently in 2014, 2016 and 2018. There is currently a recreation center, tennis courts, and a playground at this location. CMHA has not had the resources to provide a community asset such as a community center with programming or a park with recreational amenities. In deeding this property to Recreation and Parks, the Department will be able to continue to offer such programming and recreational space. There will also be the ability to make significant improvements to the facility and park, when funding is available.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nColumbus Metropolitan Housing Authority                  \n880 East 11th Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43211\nScott Scharlach, 614-421-6215\nNon-Profit Organization\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the agreements noted herein can be executed without delay. CMHA received approval for these actions at their December 2020 Board Meeting and the various agreements will be executed as soon as this ordinance is approved.\n \nBenefits to the Public: All four of the transactions will support a continued partnership with CMHA and provide more opportunities to make improvements for these underserved communities. Improving Champions Parkland will create a community park space for the surrounding neighborhoods. Acquiring the rights to Barack and Sullivant Gardens will allow Recreation and Parks to dedicate capital funding for larger scale improvements in the future. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: All of the properties involved have demonstrated significant community value in providing safe recreational programming and opportunities for all ages as well as green space for active and passive recreation.  Sullivant Gardens and Barack Community Center provide safe, recreational space in underserved neighborhoods while providing support of basic needs, such as food and health care services, for some community members. Life Care Alliance and other non-profit organizations are heavily involved in outreach within these communities and utilize these facilities often. Sawyer Center has historically provided space to Mount Vernon community groups for programming and health services. The primary concern at this location is the poor conditions of the building. Also, the current organization utilizing the space needs more room for their services and the building cannot sustain additional use without substantial investment. Champions Parkland is known as an open and maintained green space for the community. The Near East Area Commission has requested that improvements be made within the area and, since the redevelopment of the Poindexter Village area, Champions Parkland serves as a focal point for the community to have as a community park offering amenities.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Near East (56), Southside (63), Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the departments’ Master Plan by continuing to work with neighborhood groups and partners to improve upon recreational opportunities offered to the community. \n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal actions are requested at this time. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various agreements with CMHA in order to finalize property rights and ownership at Barack Recreation Center, Champions Parkland, Sawyer Community Center, and Sullivant Gardens Community Center and Park; and to declare an emergency.
