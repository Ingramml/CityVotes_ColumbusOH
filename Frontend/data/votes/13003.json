    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services to modify the professional services contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. for continued work on the Zoning Code and Map Update project, known as \"Zone In.\" The initial contract, authorized by Ordinance Number 1041-2022, was entered into in May of 2022 for a 24-month period and included two optional twelve-month extensions subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation.  The first extension was authorized by Ordinance Number 0867-2024.  The second extension was authorized by Ordinance Number 0924-2025. It is now necessary to modify the contract to add funding so Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. can continue to help guide the City through the next phase of Zone In - Economic and Housing Opportunity. \n \nThe term of the contract modification under this ordinance will be from the date of PO confirmation through May 8, 2026 to coincide with the existing contract term, which is within the second contract extension that was authorized by Ordinance Number 0924-2025. The Zone In project has always been expected to extend over multiple years under the expert guidance of Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc., therefore, it would be impractical to put the continuation of this project out for another professional service request for proposal process.  The funds needed for this modification are based on the negotiated costs of the professional services for the next phase of Zone In.\n \nThe team at Lisa Wise Consulting has been instrumental in assisting the City with the monumental task of comprehensively updating the Zoning Code.  Something that has not been done in seventy years! The 2020 Code Assessment Report noted that current City decision making processes and administrative review procedures were multi-layered, scattered and hard to use, and resulted in uncertainty for developers as well as residents. In close cooperation with City staff and outside agencies and the area commissions/civic associations, the Consultant Team will evaluate and recommend changes to the City's zoning review and administrative procedures based on best practices and the latest technological innovations. The objective is to ensure more user-friendly and efficient procedures for permitting and the administration of the Zoning Code are carried out with an understanding of the impacts of proposed changes on City staff. An updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth\nThe Consultant Team will hold weekly meetings with the City Zone In Project Team and will also work closely with other consultants on community outreach and engagement, such as participating in regular organizational and strategy meetings; preparing information for the project website, public meetings, and direct stakeholder engagement; participating in public meetings; participating in meetings with City leadership; and assessing community feedback/input in the preparation of proposed code updates.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: \nVendor: Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc.
