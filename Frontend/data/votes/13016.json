This will ensure support for coverage in the event of a failure and significantly reduce the risk of data loss.\nOrdinance No. 2942-2021, authorized the Director of Technology to enter into contract for the amount of $69,620.00.  The contract had the option to be renewed for four (4) additional one (1) year terms. Ordinance No. 2763-2022 authorized the first renewal amount of $49,476.00.  In 2023, the renewal amount of $19,118.00 was not legislated because the required amount was under the $50,000 threshold. \nOrdinance 2997-2024, passed on November 21, 2024, authorized the third (3) renewal for the Director of the Department of Technology to renew contract with The Jasper Group International, Inc.
