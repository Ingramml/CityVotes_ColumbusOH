    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to renew a contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC for the purchase of Juniper Care Services at a cost of $115,332.00. \n \nCurrently, the Department of Technology utilizes Juniper Care Services to maintain necessary service levels for our Juniper Data Center devices. This includes technical support, insights, support portal, service API, Juniper Software Support Evaluation Tool (JSSET), Support Digital Assistant, and Juniper Care Entitlements.\n \nOrdinance 2309-2024 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC for the purchase of Juniper Care Services.

This original contract established and authorized contract language allowing for four (4) mutually agreed upon one (1) year renewal options with the approval of City Council. This ordinance represents the first renewal option authorizing contracting with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC for Juniper Care Services.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC.\nThe term of the original agreement was from December 1, 2024, to November 30, 2025.
