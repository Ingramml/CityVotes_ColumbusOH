    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Safety, to modify a professional services and software licensing contract with Orion Communications Inc. for the LIONS Time and Attendance System to add  the LIONS Time and Attendance System. \n \nThe Division of Police has a need to replace the current time and attendance system and has chosen to utilize the LIONS Time and Attendance System Mobile App to manage employee attendance and payroll details. The contract includes maintenance and support services for the Time and Attendance System (LIONS) and the Accrual Import Payroll Interface.  \n \nPO490989 authorized the Director of Technology to enter a contract with Orion Communications, Inc. for the LIONS Time and Attendance System and Accrual Import Payroll Interface. The term of the initial contract was for one year starting March 24, 2025 through March 24, 2026, in the amount $42,643.00.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to modify the original contract in order to add 2,000 licenses of the LIONS Time and Attendance System - Mobile App, and to encumber additional funds for the new app service in the amount of $11,880.00. The term of the additional app service shall be from October 1, 2025 through March 24, 2026. \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: \nThe original contract amount:                                                           $42,643.00 (PO490989)                 \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                    $11,880.00 (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:  $54,523.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis unforeseen modification to add 2,000 licenses of the LIONS Time and Attendance System - Mobile App is to maintain operational efficiency for the Division of Police. The current system is being decommissioned, and a replacement is necessary.  It was decided that this Mobile App service would replace the old system and be added to the preexisting contract.   \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe Division of Police’s time and attendance software is a proprietary system from Orion Communications. As such, the City must purchase annual support and maintenance services from Orion Communications under the provisions of sole source procurement of the City of Columbus Code, Section 329. This modification adds funds to include the App License Fees.  It is in the best interest of the City to modify this contract.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is based on the pricing as defined in the attached proposal.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nOrion Communications, Inc\nVendor Account #: 010143\nExpiration date: 2/22/2026\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunding in the amount of $11,880.00 is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology’s, Information Services Division’s Operating Fund, Fund 5100.\n \n4.
