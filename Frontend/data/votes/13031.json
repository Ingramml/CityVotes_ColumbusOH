The original grant agreement expired on December 31, 2024. This legislation seeks to reauthorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a new not for profit service contract for the original amount of $76,143.00. Funding will be used by the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to administer a grant for the department’s C-PACE program. \n \nThese services provided by Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency Designation:  It is necessary to have this as an emergency to execute the agreement to provide funds from the City necessary to allow the Finance Authority to issue a grant and then close on a PACE Loan.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this project are available in the Private Grant Fund 2291, G602000.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 009436 and expires 01/12/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not for profit service agreement in an amount up to $76,143.00 with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to administer a grant for the department’s C-PACE program; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure in an amount up to $76,143.00 from the Private Grant Fund; and declare an emergency.
