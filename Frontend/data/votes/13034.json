At that time, the Director of Public Service shall seek Council approval to encumber and expend funds to support the local share of associated construction costs.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe local share of construction costs has yet to be determined as the preliminary cost estimate is still being finalized; however, the City agrees to be responsible for any construction costs not supported by ODOT. Legislation authorizing the requisite payment to ODOT shall be authorized under a separate ordinance at a later time.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis legislation is being put forth as an emergency measure as the Department of Public Service is required to provide a certified copy of this ordinance to ODOT on or before October 22, 2025, in order to expedite the project and to promote highway safety. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to an asphalt resurfacing project; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is administering the FRA- 317-0.00 project, PID 121177, which encompasses asphalt resurfacing on SR317; and \n \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned project is located within the corporate boundaries of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to grant consent and to agree to cooperate with ODOT relative to the aforementioned project; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize consent and cooperation for this project as the Department of Public Service is required to provide a certified copy of this ordinance to ODOT on or before October 22, 2025, in order to expedite the project and to promote highway safety, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat the following is an Ordinance enacted by the City of Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio, hereinafter referred to as the Local Public Agency (LPA). \n \nSECTION 1 - PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nWHEREAS, the STATE has identified the need for the described project:\n \nAsphalt resurfacing project on SR317.\n \nSECTION 2 - CONSENT STATEMENT\nBeing in the public interest, the LPA gives consent to the Director of Transportation to complete the above described project.\n \nSECTION 3 - COOPERATION STATEMENT\nThe LPA shall cooperate with the Director of Transportation in the above described project as follows:\n \nThe LPA further agrees to pay One Hundred Percent (100%) of the cost of those features requested by the LPA which are determined by the State and Federal Highway Administration to be unnecessary for the Project.\n \nThe LPA further agrees that change orders and extra work contracts required to fulfill the construction contracts shall be processed as needed. The State shall not approve a change order or extra work contract until it first gives notice, in writing, to the LPA. The LPA shall contribute its share of the cost of these items in accordance with other sections herein.\n \nThe LPA further agrees to pay their local match of pavement planning, pavement repairs, paving, and associated items.\n \nSECTION 4 - MAINTENANCE\nUpon completion of the described Project, and unless otherwise agreed, the LPA shall: (1) provide adequate maintenance for the described Project in accordance with all applicable state and federal law, including, but not limited to, 23 USC 116; (2) provide ample financial provisions, as necessary, for the maintenance of the described Project; (3) maintain the right-of-way, keeping it free of obstructions; and (4) hold said right-of-way inviolate for public highway purposes.\n \nSECTION 5 - AUTHORITY TO SIGN\nThe Director of Public Service of said City of Columbus is hereby empowered on behalf of the City of Columbus to enter into contracts with ODOT pre-qualified consultants for the preliminary engineering phase of the Project and to enter into contracts with the Director of Transportation necessary to complete the above described project.\n \nUpon the request of ODOT, the Director of Public Service is also empowered to assign all rights, title, and interests of the City of Columbus to ODOT arising from any agreement with its consultant in order to allow ODOT to direct additional or corrective work, recover damages due to errors or omissions, and to exercise all other contractual rights and remedies afforded by law or equity.\n \nThe LPA agrees that if Federal Funds are used to pay the cost of any consultant contract, the LPA shall comply with 23 CFR 172 in the selection of its consultant and the administration of the consultant contract.
