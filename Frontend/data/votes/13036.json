    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Thermoplastic Glass Beads with Potters Industries, LLC.  This contract provides for Ohio Type C glass beads used by the Division of Traffic Management for road striping to provide thermoplastic reflection.  This modification is necessary to ensure these items are readily available to enhance visibility to increase driver safety.  The contract, PO244415 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ016262 and will expire October 31, 2025.  It is in the best interest of the City that the contract be modified to allow for an extension for a period of five (5) months to and including March 31, 2026, allowing sufficient time to establish a new contract(s) through using a formal bid process.\n \nPursuant to Section 329.09(a) of Columbus City Codes:\n(1) Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funding is necessary to modify the option contract.\n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A\n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: N/A\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: N/A\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency to maintain an uninterrupted supply of the goods provided by the UTC, as the current contract expires on October 31, 2025 and time is needed to allow for a formal bid process.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Department of Public Service must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend the contract for the option to purchase Thermoplastic Glass Beads with Potters Industries LLC, and to declare an emergency.
