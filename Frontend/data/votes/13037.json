West High School will identify students to attend the program, and provide security, transportation, and social work supports. During the summer (June-August), 2026 NELC staff will work with any West student who attended NELC programming during the 2025-2026 school year at West High School.\nThis program will directly support action steps 6.2 - Increase 4-year high school graduation rate - and 6.3 - Reduce high school dropouts - of the Envision Hilltop Community Plan. \nFiscal Impact: The fiscal impact associated with the execution of the grant agreement is in the amount of $172,238.00 and is to come from Fund 1000 General Fund (GF).\nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested in order to ensure the funding can be made available to the YMCA so that the program can begin at the start of the 2025 - 2026 school year.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the Young Men’s Christian Association of Central Ohio (YMCA) for the purposes of administering a Nontraditional Education Learning Center for students at West High School; to authorize the expenditure of $172,238.00 from the Department of Neighborhoods; to advance funding per a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
