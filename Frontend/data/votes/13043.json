($23,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio, Inc., (MHA) a non-profit corporation, to provide fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program for an increased amount of $23,000, for a total contract amount not to exceed $123,000. The contract period is from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2026.  The original authorizing legislation is 0509-2024.\n \nColumbus Public Health has a need to increase the current contract amount to ensure that existing intervention activities being facilitated by MHA are adequately carried out by the One Block at a Time program (OBAT). The need for additional services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was awarded due to the unpredictability of the number of residents being served and at what capacity. Processes and procedures are already established under this contract and changing vendors would disrupt care for residents. The price for additional services was determined based on the average cost of services already provided and extrapolated to the end of the contract period.\n \nOBAT is a micro community intervention aimed at increasing the health and wellness of one block in the Linden area. OBAT requires a fiscal agent for this program due to the nature of the interventions, including meeting emergent needs for residents, purchasing and providing items and food for block events, supporting home repairs and physical improvements, gift cards, and other program incidentals.\n \nMental Health America of Ohio is a nonprofit entity and is exempt from contract compliance certification.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:\nEmergency action is being requested in order to avoid a gap in this critical service and to meet the ongoing demands of the intervention activities provided by the Columbus Public Health One Block at a Time program within the Linden community.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Expenditures to provide these services are budgeted in the 2025 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250. ($23,000.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio, Inc. to add additional funding for the Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program; to authorize an expenditure from the Health Special Revenue Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($23,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to modify an existing not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio to provide fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the not-for-profit contract will be increased by $23,000.00, for a new total contract amount not to exceed $123,000.00. The contract period will remain from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2026.\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to modify the not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio, Inc. to add additional funding to support Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program, in order to avoid a gap in this critical service and to meet the ongoing demands of the intervention activities provided to the Linden community, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify an existing not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio, Inc. that provides fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program to add additional funding by increasing the contract amount by $23,000.00, for a new total contract amount not to exceed $123,000.00. The contract period will remain from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $23,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from the 2025 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund 2250, Department 50, Division 5001, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this not-for-profit contract is in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all not-for-profit contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance and to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this not-for-profit contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City's financial records.\n \nSECTION65.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
