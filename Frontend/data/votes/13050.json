    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes a supplemental appropriation of $45,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (“Municipal Court Clerk”) computer fund for the purchase of toner. Due to recent legislative changes, the Municipal Court Clerk is now required to have electronic filing available for all case types and filings. The Municipal Court Clerk is compliant with this requirement, however, there has been significant impacts on our toner usage since the expansion of electronic filing. \nIn the past, the filing party provided physical copies to be sent out to the requested parties. However, when the documents are electronically filed the Municipal Court Clerk is currently taking on the burden of printing and preparing the copies to be served and put in the physical file. The Municipal Court Clerk is working in collaboration with the Municipal Court Judges and Administration to reduce the reliance on the physical file and the amount the Municipal Court Clerk is printing.  \nFiscal Impact: Funds for the supplemental appropriation totaling $45,000.00 are available within the Municipal Court Clerk’s Computer Fund.   \nEmergency: There is an immediate need to authorize a supplemental appropriation for the continuity of the Municipal Court Clerk’s daily operations.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize a supplemental appropriation of $45,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Municipal Court Clerk computer fund; and to declare an emergency. ($45,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance will allow the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk to appropriate said funds within the unappropriated balance of the Municipal Court Clerk computer fund; and\nWHEREAS, that the funds are available within the Municipal Court Clerk computer fund; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the daily operations of the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk in that it is immediately necessary to appropriate said funds to purchase toner for the daily operations of the Municipal Court Clerk, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, safety, and welfare, now therefore\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That from the unappropriated monies in the Municipal Court Clerk computer fund and from all monies estimated to be deposited into said fund, the sum of $45,000.00 be and is hereby appropriated within the Municipal Court Clerk's Computer Fund 227, Subfund 222702, Object Class 62020.\nSECTION 2.
