    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of Columbus Water and Power (CWP), to enter into a contract with Real Time Networks, Inc. for maintenance and ongoing support of an electronic key management system.\n \nThe Real Time Networks, Inc. key management system equips CWP with comprehensive key tracking capabilities, enhancing the security of assets, facilities, and vehicles, and assurance of continuous operational safety.\n \nTo procure these services, a Request for Proposals (SA005016) was published June 12, 2013.  The solicitation received six (6) proposals, which were scored by an evaluation committee of seven (7) representatives from the Department of Technology, Department of Public Utilities (now Columbus Water and Power), and Fleet Management Division. Because the RFP process was used to purchase the hardware associated with the key management system instead of the Invitation to Bid (ITB) process, Ord. 2422-2013 requested and authorized a waiver of competitive bidding provisions, in accordance with section 329.27 of Columbus City Code. \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes a waiver of competitive bidding, in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes. Given the established relationship with this contractor, and the lack of sufficient time to obtain and award bids before the current contract expires, it is in the City’s best interest to utilize bid waiver legislation for this ordinance.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $53,652.00 for the above-described services for the period of one year from the date of a confirmed purchase order by the City Auditor’s Office.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $53,652.00 is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Division Operating Fund, Fund 5100. \nEMERGENCY\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation. The current contract expired on August 31, 2025. To ensure a contract for the provision of the services described is in place as soon as possible, emergency action is necessary.  A lapse in service would negatively affect critical key management services that are necessary for the day-to-day operations of Columbus Water and Power. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Real Time Networks, Inc. \nVendor Account: 020066 \nExpiration Date: 6/7/2024\n \nReal Time Networks, Inc. will ensure contract compliance before a purchase order is issued.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of Columbus Water and Power, to enter into a contract with Real Time Networks, Inc. for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic key management system; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize an expenditure from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($53,652.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of Columbus Water and Power, to enter into a contract with Real Time Networks, Inc. for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic key management system; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $53,652.00 for key management services by Real Time Network, Inc.; and \n \nWHEREAS, the term of this agreement shall be for a period of one year from the date of a confirmed purchase order by the City Auditor’s Office; and\n \nWHEREAS, a waiver of the relevant provisions of Columbus City Codes relating to competitive bidding is hereby authorized; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with Real Time Network, Inc., as the current contract expired August 31, 2025, on behalf of Columbus Water and Power, for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic key management system, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the total expenditure of $53,652.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized to be expended from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund, as follows in the attachment to this ordinance. (2234-2025 EXP)\n \nSECTION 3. That this Council finds it in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code to enter into this contract.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for any contract or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.
