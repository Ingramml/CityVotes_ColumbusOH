    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a contribution agreement, or similar instrument, with and to provide funding to the Columbus Metropolitan Library, a public library, relative to Phase II of the 2020 Vision Plan. \nDescribed as “a multi-phased comprehensive blueprint that reinvents and revitalizes the entire 600,000 square feet maintained by the library”, the 2020 Vision Plan aims “to address and prioritize the needs of its aging locations and the evolving community demands upon them”. Phase I of “the aspirational building program” encompassed the renovation or reconstruction of 10 of 23 locations, and as part of that initial effort, the City agreed to contribute a maximum of $3,790,000.00 to support public infrastructure improvements at the following locations: Main Library, Northside Branch, Shepherd Branch, Martin Luther King, Jr. Branch, Driving Park Branch, Parsons Branch and Northern Lights Branch. \nPhase II of the 2020 Vision Plan will culminate in the renovation or construction of four branches this year, and the City has agreed to contribute a maximum of $3,000,000.00 to subsidize a portion of the costs associated with renovating and expanding the existing Barnett and Linden branches and constructing a new Marion-Franklin Branch. This legislation seeks to authorize the execution of a contribution agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto as may be necessary, between the Department of Public Service and the Columbus Metropolitan Library and the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funding for that purpose. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this project is available as follows: $1,800,000.00 within the Northland and Other Acquisitions Bond Fund and $1,200,000.00 within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to facilitate the execution of the requisite contribution agreement by the parties on or before September 30, 2025. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contribution agreement with the Columbus Metropolitan Library and to provide funding to the same relative to Phase II of the 2020 Vision Plan to renovate and expand the  existing Barnett and Linden library branch locations and to construct the new Marion-Franklin Branch; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,800,000.00 from the Northland and Other Acquisitions Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,200,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
