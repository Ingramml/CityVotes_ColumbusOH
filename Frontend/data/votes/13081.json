    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $50,000.00 to establish funding to repay various property owners for costs associated with the replacement of deteriorated concrete curb. \n \nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management, is responsible for curb replacement within the City limits.  Deteriorated curb is typically replaced by the City when a street is resurfaced.  As it can be many years between resurfacing of the same street, the City has a program to reimburse property owners that do not want to wait to replace deteriorated curb until their street is resurfaced.    \n \nProperty owners contact the Division of Infrastructure Management and are approved for the Curb Reimbursement Program.  Reimbursement occurs subsequent to inspection of the new curb by the City.  The majority of these replacements occur while the property owners are constructing new sidewalk, which are ordinarily the property owners' responsibility to maintain and/or replace.  The Division of Infrastructure Management requires funding for this beneficial program to improve curbs in the City.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this expense is available within Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Improvement NonBond Fund.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority to align cash with the proper project.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nPublic Service is requesting emergency designation so as to provide sufficient funding to be able to reimburse residents without delay. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget;
