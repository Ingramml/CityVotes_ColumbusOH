    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing service contract with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Labcorp) for Laboratory Testing Services for the Sexual Health and Wellness Center and the Alcohol and Drug Services Program. The contract period for this contract modification is March 1, 2025 to March 31, 2026 with an amount not to exceed $38,000.00, for a new total contract amount of $90,000.00.\n \nColumbus Public Health (CPH) has a need to increase Laboratory Testing Services within our Sexual Health and Wellness Center which are required to aid in the treatment of and/or prevention of infectious diseases and Alcohol and Drug Services Program. The volume is dependent on patient need. The additional services is due to an increase in patients without insurance who are also Medicaid ineligible which contributes to increased costs. This increase amount is based on the previous six months of purchased services which represent the current testing volume of the patients. \n \nThe current pricing was determined based on the estimated volume and using Labcorp’s existing contract rate of fifty-five percent discount. \n \nCPH has determined that it would not be in the best interest to have the additional contract awarded through other processes due to the lead time required for an integration within our existing electronic medical record system. Additional details are outlined in the attached bid waiver. Therefore, we are requesting that the competitive bidding provisions outlined in Chapter 329.18 of the Columbus City Code be waived. \n \nLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings' contract compliance number is CC-000670 expiring January 7, 2027.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $38,000.00 is budgeted in the Health Department Grant Fund for the Sexual Health and Wellness Center and Alcohol and Drug Services Program.  \n \nEMERGENCY: There is an immediate need to continue Laboratory Testing Services with Labcorp. A disruption to those services could be harmful to current patients according to medical treatment standards which could increase the risk of infectious disease transmission and disrupt harm reduction efforts in Franklin County.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings for increased Laboratory Testing Services for the Sexual Health and Wellness Center for the period of March 1, 2025 to March 31, 2026; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $38,000.00 from the Health Department Grant fund; and to declare an emergency. ($38,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health has a need to modify an existing contract for Laboratory Testing Services for the contract period of March 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026; and \n \nWHEREAS, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings has the expertise required to provide these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the Columbus Public Health Department to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board to modify a contract with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to ensure the continued Laboratory Testing Services to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in Franklin County, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify the existing contract with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings in the amount not to exceed $38,000.00, for a new total contract amount of $90,000, for the Sexual Health and Wellness Center for the period of March 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026. \n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the costs of said contract, an expenditure not to exceed $38,000.00 is authorized from the Health Department Grant fund, Fund No. 2251, per the attached accounting document. \n \nSECTION 4.  That the provisions of Sections 329.18 of the Columbus City Code are hereby waived. \n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this Ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
