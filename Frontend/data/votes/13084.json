    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: PO466189 authorized the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (hereinafter \"Municipal Court Clerk\") to enter into a one-year contract with Huntington National Bank for the provisions of bank and credit card services. This ordinance authorizes the Municipal Court Clerk to modify and extend the contract one year with Huntington National Bank for the provisions of bank, credit card, and electronic payment services.\nCurrently, the Municipal Court Clerk contracts with a third-party vendor for the provision of electronic payment services. Modifying the contract with Huntington National Bank by adding their SnapPay Solution streamlines the Municipal Court Clerk’s electronic payment services by providing a more modern transaction to the public and eliminates the need for a third-party vendor between the Municipal Court Clerk and their banking servicer. \nContracts:\nPO136576; $2,500.00\nPO191858; $500.00\nPO245805; $18,000.00\nPO296644; $30,000.00\nPO346554; $30,000.00\nPO408088; $24,000.00\nPO466189; $20,000.00\nOrdinance: 1876-2025; $22,000.00\nContract Compliance: 31-0966785\nExpiration Date: 04/18/2026\nDAX Vendor Number: 004526\nContract Modification: \nThis Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications.\n1.                     Amount of additional funds: Amount of additional funds to be expended under this modification is $22,000.00.\n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen: Additional funds were unforeseen due to the unexpected modification of adding the electronic payment service to the contract. \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used: Modifying the current contract with Huntington National Bank is the most cost-effective method because it streamlines the electronic payment services and eliminates the need for a third-party vendor. \n4.                     How was cost determined: Cost determination: The cost was determined by written quotes from the vendor. \n \nBid Information: The Municipal Court Clerk is in need to extend an existing contract with Huntington National Bank and modify the existing contract to allow for the addition of electronic payment services.  Therefore, the Municipal Court Clerk is requesting this City Council to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \nFiscal Impact: Funds totaling $22,000.00 are available within the Municipal Court Clerk's General Fund.\nEmergency: To maintain uninterrupted bank and credit services for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize Municipal Court Clerk to modify and extend the contract one year with Huntington National Bank for bank, credit card, and electronic payment services for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office; to waive the competitive provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $22,000.00 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
