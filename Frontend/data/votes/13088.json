    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this ordinance is to repeal Ordinance 1765-2025 in its entirety and replace it with a new ordinance.  The new ordinance, contained herein, will change the entity’s name with whom the City enters into agreement and authorizes the assignment of the agreement to another entity.\n \nOrdinance 1765-2025, passed by Columbus City Council on July 14, 2025, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Reserve at Maryland Avenue LLC for development of 84 housing units in an amount up to $2,020,000.00 and to reimburse construction expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order.  The project is known as The Reserve at Maryland.  As the development deal was finalized, the development team determined it was best to enter into a grant agreement with the City through the Oregon Corporation for Affordable Housing (OCAH), an Oregon nonprofit corporation, and then OCAH shall assign the agreement to Reserve at Maryland Ave, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company.\n \nThe Reserve at Maryland Avenue is a proposed 84-unit, multifamily development to offer income restricted housing to current and future residents of Columbus’ Near East Side. The project, which is in a Qualified Census Tract and within a specifically designated CRA target area within the City of Columbus, is an important part of the Near East Side Plan for revitalization. \n \nConnect Housing Blocks, an industrialized unit manufacturer in Columbus, will manufacture the individual dwelling units. The concept of modular units has many advantages: they are more environmentally sustainable and produce 70% less waste than a traditional stick build and are less weather dependent and more time efficient to build.  Due to the nature of building the units off site in a manufacturing facility, each unit is a separately licensed industrialized unit that is inspected in the factory, which leads to less burden for municipalities for inspections. \n \nThe complex will consist of five buildings: four residential buildings and a clubhouse. The unit mix will be 24 one-bedroom units, 48 two-bedroom units, and 12 three-bedroom units in four residential buildings; all units will be set to 60% AMI. The community will offer competitive unit sizes and amenities including fully equipped kitchens with dishwashers and garbage disposals, washer/dryer hookups, and spacious closets.  Project amenities include a playground, ample green space, and a separate community center with a kitchenette, exercise room, computer center, sitting area, and covered patio. \n \nThe location is within a half mile of the Amazon Distribution Center, four different transit stops, a daycare, and Eastgate Elementary School. Within one mile, residents will find several grocery stores and a public park.\n \nEmergency action is requested to maintain the construction schedule and to fulfill financing needs prior to closing deadlines with the developer’s other lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this project will not be available to the Department of Development until the bonds are sold related to the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget and are available at a future date, therefore it is necessary to certify the required funds, in the amount up to $2,020,000.00, against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099.  The fund will be reimbursed upon receipt of the bonds.  There is sufficient budgetary authority for this project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 053446 and contract compliance is pending.\n \nTitle\n \nTo repeal ordinance 1765-2025 in its entirety; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Oregon Corporation for Affordable Housing for development of 84 housing units in an amount up to $2,020,000.00; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to approve and execute an Assignment and Assumption Agreement that allows the  Oregon Corporation for Affordable Housing to assign some of its rights, responsibilities, and obligations under the grant agreement to Reserve at Maryland Avenue, LLC; to authorize the appropriation of funds within the Income Set Aside Subfund and the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the transfer of cash between the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,020,000.00 within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the reimbursement of construction expenditures incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order beginning January 1, 2024; and to declare an emergency.
