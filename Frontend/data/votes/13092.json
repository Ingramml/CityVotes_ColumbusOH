Franklin County approved the annexation on June 17, 2025 and the City Clerk received notice on July 10, 2025. \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation in the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to pass this ordinance due to the need of the developer needing to proceed with the development of this site for multi-family units for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety\n \nTitle\n \nTo accept the application (AN25-008) of Hank W. & Patricia Schreck and James E. & Karen L.
