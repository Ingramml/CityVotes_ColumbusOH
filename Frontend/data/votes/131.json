    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health originating from the Centers for Disease Control.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $120,000.00 in grant monies to fund the Creating Healthy Communities Grant Program for the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.  \n \nThis grant will utilize population-based strategies to address healthy eating, active living and smoke free living, with the goal of reducing chronic diseases. \n \nThe percentage of overweight and obese adults within the priority communities of Linden, South Side and West Side, is approximately 65%, with almost 60% of the residents in the priority communities not meeting the physical activity guidelines. 54.4% of adult residents are eating less than one serving of fruit per day, and 69.3% are eating less than one serving of vegetables per week (BRFSS - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2011-2016).  Lastly, almost 35.1% of residents within the priority communities are current smokers, compared to 22.7% in Franklin County (BRFSS, 2011-2016).\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible given the grant start date of January 1, 2021.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is funded by the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City match.
