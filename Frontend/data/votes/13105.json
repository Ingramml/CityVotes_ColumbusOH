    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the contract for the option to purchase Weed and Vegetation Management with TruGreen LP. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Weed and Vegetation Management with TruGreen LP, cc# 007293 & expires 11/14/2025. This contract provides for Weed and Vegetation Management primarily for the Department of Public Utilities and other agencies as needed. The Department of Finance and Management established the contract, PO309302, in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ020150 and will expire 12/31/2025. In accordance with the bid specifications, the City and TruGreen LP can renew the contract for two (2) additional one-year periods. However, the original ordinance 3227-2021 only authorized a one (1) additional one year renewal. The first one-year renewal has already been executed and now both the City of Columbus and the vendor wish to extend for the second one-year period. The new contract expiration date would be 12/31/2026.\n \n(1) No additional funding will be immediately necessary.  However, users of the UTC will have to secure their own funding for use of the UTC for the additional price/additional item as they place orders.\n(2) The need for an additional year of services was foreseen when drafting the contract specifications, however the Ordinance failed to include the second year of extension.\n(3) No additional contract requirements are needed, and it is in the City’s best interests to utilize the additional one-year renewal option.\n(4) No change in pricing is anticipated at this time.\n \n FISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  Agencies must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the contract for the option to purchase Weed and Vegetation Management with TruGreen LP. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Weed and Vegetation Management for use throughout the City of Columbus; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing Universal Term Contract with TruGreen LP, to extend the contract for an additional one-year period; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management  in that it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify a Universal Term Contract with TruGreen LP for the option to extend Weed and Vegetation Management, to authorize an additional one (1) year extension that was authorized in the contract documents but was not legislated, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify a Universal Contract for the option to obtain Weed and Vegetation Management with TruGreen LP.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
