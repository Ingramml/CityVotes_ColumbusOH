CAP-STONE & Associates, Inc. (dba and referred to throughout as Stone Environmental Engineering and Science Inc.) has been assisting the Department of Finance and Management in preparing Environmental Review Records for U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funded projects. \nThe Department of Finance and Management utilized a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process to identify and assess qualified firms for providing environmental review services. Proposals were submitted in response RFQ015377 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to professional services contracts, through which process Stone Environmental Engineering and Science Inc. received the highest overall score. RFQ015377 also stated that the proposal may be renewed annually for a period of up to five (5) years.\nOrdinance 2994-2023 authorized the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a professional services contract with Stone Environmental Engineering and Science Inc. (PO432141, PO432147, PO432149) for consultation services in the amount of $110,000.00 including CDBG, HOME, and HOME-ARP funds for the period of January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.

Ordinance 1077-2025 increased the budget by $20,000.00 using CDBG funds, for a total project cost of $160,000.00. \nThis Ordinance is needed to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the aforementioned contract to again increase the budget by $150,000.00 due to unforeseen costs of testing for and mitigating contamination and toxic substances found during the environmental review process. This budget increase includes $120,000.00 of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, $20,000.00 of HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) funds, and $10,000.00 of HOME-ARP funds, for a total project cost of $310,000.00. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance will authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $120,000.00 from the Community Development Fund (Fund 2248), $20,000.00 from the HOME Investment Partnerships Fund (Fund 2201), and $10,000.00 from the HOME-ARP Fund (Fund 2201) for a total expenditure of $150,000.00.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to increase the budget for this contract so that Stone Environmental Engineering and Science Inc. will have the ability to continue assisting the Department of Finance and Management with preparing environmental review records and avoid disruption in providing such services, to comply with federal requirements, and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify the professional services contract with Stone Environmental Engineering and Science Inc. to increase the budget by $150,000.00; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $120,000.00 from the Community Development Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $20,000.00 from the HOME Investment Partnerships Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $10,000.00 from the HOME-ARP Fund; and to declare an emergency.
