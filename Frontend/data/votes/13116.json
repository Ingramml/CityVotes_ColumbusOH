    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with 2LMN, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Signals - N. 4th Street, Phase 1 project.\nOrdinance 2904-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with 2LMN, Inc. for the Signals - N. 4th Street, Phase 1 project.  Ordinance 1222-2024 authorized the Interim Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $150,000.00.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $35,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $35,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $600,000.00     (PO364227, Ord. 2904-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $150,000.00     (PO449440, Ord. 1222-2024)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $35,000.00       (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $785,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is to cover the expanded scope of relocating utility and lighting facilities and the associated maintenance of traffic during construction. Utility conflicts were discovered during the project, and signal clearances require the lighting circuit to be placed underground and in some locations with new poles. Where luminaires can be relocated, structural analysis of existing poles is necessary. In addition, lighting calculations are necessary since poles are being relocated. Through multiple field meetings with the utility representatives, our utility coordinator, and signal reviewers, it was determined that the most cost effective direction for the project was to go underground and relocate the lighting facilities. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe consultant is under contract and currently working on designing the project, therefore it was decided that it is in the best interest of the Ciy to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work and keep the project on schedule to meet project funding fiscal years related to awarded OPWC grant funding. \n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe contract modification was determined based on anticipated necessary effort to complete the project. This information was used to negotiate a fee for the contract modification. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against 2LMN, Inc. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for 2LMN, Inc. is CC015414 and expires 4/11/2026.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $35,000.00 is available within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget and transfer of funds is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. Funds are appropriated.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with 2LMN, Inc. in connection with the Signals - N. 4th Street, Phase 1 project;  and to authorize the expenditure of up to $35,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to pay for the project.  ($35,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
