However, community input will be sought as appropriate for work that results from contracts awarded through this auditor certificate.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This arrangement will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to ensure that parks, trails, and facilities remain accessible, safe, updated, and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: $500,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of these various expenditures.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish an auditor’s certificate in the amount of $500,000.00 for continued professional architectural, engineering, and construction management services in conjunction with park, trail, and facility capital improvement projects managed by the Recreation and Parks Department; to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into multiple future professional service contracts as previously authorized in Ordinance 2486-2024; to authorize the transfer of $500,000.00 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $500,000.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $500,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
