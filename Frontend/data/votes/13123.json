    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: \nThe legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with St. Stephen’s Community Services, Inc. dba St. Stephen’s Community House (SSCH) in support of the Food and Nutrition Center (FNC) Delivery Program.\nSt Stephen’s Community House - Food and Nutrition Center (FNC) Delivery Program addresses food insecurity issues in the Linden community. The FNC Delivery Program provides the distribution of food boxes (35-40 pounds per household) to those vulnerable residents who are unable to utilize services at a traditional food pantry due to a variety of reasons - lack of transportation, physically disabled, lack of resources, homebound, etc. The program runs four days a week, delivering food boxes to over 225 residents twice a month.\nCompared to the same time last year, 2025 delivery services increased by 29% providing 42,500 meals to the Linden community.  Currently, 80% of households receiving delivery services have senior citizens and/or a minor child living in the home. The program currently uses SSCH vehicles to deliver the food boxes; employ staff to operate the program; and input all data into PantryTrak. This funding will be used to continue payroll and administrative costs for pantry assistants and delivery drivers.\nThe City of Columbus Department of Neighborhoods has been a supporter of the FNC since 2022. Funding from the City of Columbus Department of Neighborhoods will be used to support the One Linden Community Plan Big Idea to “Support Resident Health - Consider alternative ways to get fresh/healthy foods to households”.
