    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Administrative and Presiding Judge to enter into contract with Alvis Inc., a non-profit agency, and authorizes the expenditure of up to $131,608 .00 from the governmental grants fund for peer support of specialized docket participants.\n \nAlvis will provide two (2) certified Peer Support individuals to serve the needs of Probationers under the jurisdiction of the Franklin County Municipal Court. The Court will participate in the recruitment and final selection of Peer Support staff assigned to the Specialty Dockets. This staff members' primary headquarters is the Municipal Court offices. An appropriately licensed Clinical Supervisor will supervise the certified Peer Support. \n \nThe Alvis Peer Support staff members will provide case management, referrals to recovery supports, and presence during formal and informal court hearings/meetings. The Peer Supports will also provide other services as needed to support the Probationer’s recovery and successful supervision period. \n \nIt is well established in the realm of modern mental health services that certified peer supporters who walk alongside individuals struggling with mental illness and/or addiction have a unique perspective and gift of shared experiences to offer them and support their path to recovery. According to AllRise, the national authority on best practices in treatment courts, “Research has associated peer recovery support services with reductions in the recurrence of substance use, improved treatment engagement and retention, higher participant satisfaction, and reductions in emergency service utilization and hospitalizations.”   \n \nThe Franklin County Municipal Court has integrated Peer Support Specialists into its Specialized Dockets for several years with impactful results. Peer Support Specialists connect with participants immediately upon acceptance into the Specialized Docket and engage with them throughout their time with the program and even beyond graduation. The Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services has established a certification process for peer support specialists, formalizing the role as a paid profession. This program allows those with an established period of recovery and a drive to help others to further their professional development. \n \nEmergency Legislation is requested so that the contract can start on September 15. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funds are available within the governmental grants fund for this purpose.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into contract with Alvis Inc. for the provision of peer support staff; to authorize the expenditure of up to an amount not to exceed $131,608.00 from the governmental grants fund; and to declare an emergency.   ($131,608.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Court has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into contract with Alvis; and\n \nWHEREAS, $131,608 is needed to provide for services during the period through September 30, 2026; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the court, in that it is immediately necessary for the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges to authorize the contract and authorize the expenditure for peer support staffing with Alvis in this critical area of need for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court be and is hereby authorized to enter into contract with Alvis Inc. for peer support staffing for the specialized dockets for the period ending September 30, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $131,608.00 or as much thereof as may be necessary is hereby authorized from the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges governmental grants fund.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.   That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
