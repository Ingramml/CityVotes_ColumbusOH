    "description": "...Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Dam Engineering Services CT2 (DES2) project, CIP #690555-100002, in an amount not to exceed $200,000.00.  \n \nA variety of consulting services are required to meet planning, operational, capital improvement, and regulatory compliance needs of DOWs dam portfolio.  To meet these needs an RFP was issued and awarded to Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Dam Engineering Services CT2 (DES2) project.  The contract was approved by City Council via Ordinance 1080-2024 on 5/13/24.  This contract provides professional Dam Engineering Services (DES) to supplement existing engineering personnel within the Division of Water on an as-authorized, as-needed basis.  This modification will continue funding the contract work of establishing task order based professional services to augment existing technical support personnel within the Division of Water on an as-authorized, as-needed basis in order to accomplish a wide range of work that may include but is not limited to planning, design, and construction phase architectural services. \n \nThe Community Area is “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1.  UPDATED TIMELINE & FUTURE RENEWALS\nThere is no change in the timeline.  This is the first of three planned contract modifications to add funding.  The contract will expire when the last assigned task under contract modification 3 is completed and accepted by the City as stated in 1080-2024, the authorizing ordinance for this contract.  \n \n1.2.  ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT\nThis contract modification is expected to be $200,000.00.  Modifications will be performed on an as needed basis for future funding needs.  It is anticipated that total spending during the term of the project could total $800,000.00.  The amount of the initial contract and anticipated future contract modifications is listed below.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Initial Contract (ORD 1080-2024; PO459973)                     $ 200,000.00\nModification #1 (This modification - PO TBD)                     $ 200,000.00\n                     Future Modification #2 (future)                                                                                    $ 200,000.00\n                     Future Modification #3 (future)                                                                                    $ 200,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                         $ 800,000.00\n \n1.3.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4.  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe City project team identified the services that would be needed for this contract over the modification period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services using existing contract job titles, hourly rates, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project team and final pricing was negotiated with the consultant.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis Dam Engineering Services CT2 (DES2) contract will support various projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects will maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the Central Ohio area.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nMost projects will be located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public and for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for projects that occur outside of secure areas.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying DPU’s environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nBurgess & Niple, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004425 and expires 1/10/2026.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $200,000.00 are available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within Fund 6006 (Water Bond Fund) is also needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to add funding for the Dam Engineering Services CT2 (DES2) project with Burgess & Niple, Inc.;
