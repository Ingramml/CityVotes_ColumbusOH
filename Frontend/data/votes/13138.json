Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 1768-2023.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.  \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by DLZ, Ohio, Inc., reviewed by the Division of Power, and was deemed acceptable.  The fees in the proposal are based upon contract pricing already established for job titles, tasks, and allowable expenses for the contract.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe installation and conversion to LED lighting within the project area will provide both an additional sense of safety and security to the residents.  This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nDLZ Ohio, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004939 and expires 7/22/2026.  \n                                                       \nDLZ Ohio, Inc.'s certification was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for construction administration and inspection in the amount of $125,572.91 is available and appropriated within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303. The 2025 Capital Improvement Budget will need to be amended to align budget authority with the proper project.
