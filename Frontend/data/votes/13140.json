Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 0849-2023.  \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between CTL Engineering, Inc. and the Department based upon the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will install new storm sewer and water main to improve the degraded system in this area. This project will increase level of service for Barnett Road and surrounding neighborhoods.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nCTL Engineering Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004209 and expires 5/13/2026.\n \nCTL plans to perform this work without the use of sub-consultants. \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CTL Engineering, Inc.\n                                                         \nCTL Engineering Inc.’s certification was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe Barnett Rd Stormwater Improvements project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2720-2024, passed by Council on 10/28/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA October 2025 Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.  This project is budgeted within the OWDA Storm Sewers Fund, Fund 6211, in the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget.    Funds will need to be appropriated in the OWDA Storm Sewers Fund, Fund 6211.  \n \nThe Barnett Rd Water Main Improvements project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0700-2025, passed by Council on 3/31/25.  This ordinance is contingent upon the approval of the OWDA loan, which is anticipated to be approved in October 2025.  This project is budgeted within the Water - Water Fresh Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, in the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget.  Funds will need to be appropriated in the Water - Water Fresh Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014.\n \nThe OWDA Storm Sewers Fund and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program are both reimbursement programs.  Purchase orders will need to be established to CTL Engineering Inc. for this contract modification.  Public Utilities will need to pay the construction administration and inspection charges directly to CTL Engineering Inc., and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with CTL Engineering, Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract;
