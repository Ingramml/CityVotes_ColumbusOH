    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services (BZS) to modify and extend the document conversion services contract with 3SG Plus, LLC in an amount up to $102,000.00. The initial contract, authorized by Ordinance Number 2471-2024, was entered into in December 1, 2024 for a 12-month period and included two twelve-month extensions and two additional optional twelve-month extensions all subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation. It is now necessary to modify the contract to extend the contract period and add funding for the next 12 months of services. \n \nBZS has a need for the conversion of physical documents into electronic images, which optimizes storage space, reduces future storage costs, and provides efficient access to department information. These services have been consistently utilized by BZS since 2014.\n \nThe project was formally advertised on the Bonfire portal from June 7, 2024 to July 12, 2024. The evaluation committee, including representatives from the Building and Zoning Services and Technology departments, evaluated the statements of qualifications and reviewed technical proposals for all offerors and determined that 3SG Plus, LLC was the highest qualified offeror. The Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized contract negotiations between the City and 3SG Plus, LLC, which were successful. \n \nThe funds needed for this modification are based on costs negotiated in 2025 for the next year of services, due to decreased real need compared to the forecast provided in the Request for Statements of Qualifications. This document conversion project has always been expected to extend over multiple years. The contract modification authorized by this ordinance will extend the term date from November 30, 2025 to November 30, 2026.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: \nVendor: 3SG Plus, LLC.
