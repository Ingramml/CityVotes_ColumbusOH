No. 2011-2023, passed on July 31, 2023, provided an additional $1,250,000.00 to the project, authorized a restrictive covenant, allowing for some units to be utilized for the City's HOME match requirement which is an obligation for the City's HOME entitlement allocation.  The ordinance also permitted the assignment of some or all duties and responsibilities under the agreement to the project owner, Easton Loop Apartments II, LLC.  \n \nThe grant agreement for the total project contribution of $6,050,000.00 was created under purchase order PO421051.\n \nThis modification will adjust the mix of income levels as defined in the grant agreement from 30% AMI to 60% AMI to 30% AMI to 70% AMI.  The change in income levels served for the project was not known at the time the contract was executed.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is required.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 004842 and expires 03/13/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department Development to modify a grant agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc.
