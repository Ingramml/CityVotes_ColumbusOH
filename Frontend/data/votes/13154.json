    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with HDS Companies LLC (HDS) in an amount up to $52,500.00 of federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA2) funds and to modify the scope of service for the transition of data from the Allita system to the City of Columbus. \n \nOrdinance 3393-2022 authorized the Director of Development to enter into a contract with HDS in an amount of up to $239,228.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to provide software to administer the federally funded Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program and to allow for payment of services. The City has a need to continue utilizing this software including renewing the system license, maintenance, technical support, professional services, software hosting, storage of data, reporting and training for the continued operation of the ERA program and entered into a new contract with HDS which was authorized by Ordinance 2708-2023 in an amount up to $596,110.00. \n \nHDS’ software, Allita 360, is a fully web and end-to-end digital solution. This system supports intake and processing of applications for rent and utility assistance. The system supports separate portals for tenants, property managers/landlords, agencies, and community. The system is ADA compliant and supports multi-language applications. This software moves applications quickly through the process of approval and meets eligibility requirements. The system provides consistency among agency partners and flexibility to fund applications efficiently. \n \nThe City has a need to transfer the ERA2 application data from the Allita system to the City for retention purposes of the federal program.  This modification has been planned as from the beginning the City was aware there would be additional cost and modification within the agreement to include the transfer services.  \n \nEmergency action is necessary in order to ensure the contract has been modified within the timeframe  and that all data transferring has been complete prior to the end date of the contract of December 31, 2025.  The City must have access to the data for federal reporting and record retention purposes.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $52,500.00 is available in the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund (Fund 2208).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 044403 and expires on 01/24/2027.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the scope of service and increase funding of a contract with HDS Companies LLC in an amount up to $52,500.00 for the transferring of application data from Allita to the City; to authorize the expenditure of $52,500.00 from the ERA2 fund; and to declare an emergency. ($52,500.00)\n \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the city and its partners needing a software solution to administer the city’s and Franklin County’s federal Emergency Rental Assistance funds received as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n \nWHEREAS, the city and its partners selected the Allita 360 software system and individual organizations paid a portion of the costs for access to the software; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the city to allow for the modification of the scope of service to further account for the transferring of data from HDS to the City and increase funding of the contract in an amount up to $52,500.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the contract  with the HDS Companies LLC to increase funding and modify the scope of service to further clarify the need for the transferring of data from HDS to the City prior to the end of the contract as the City must have access to the application data for federal reporting and financial records, thereby preserving the public health, peace, safety, property, and welfare; now, therefore\n                      \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify a contract with HDS Companies LLC (HDS) in an amount up to $52,500.00 and modify the scope of service to include the transferring of data from HDS to the City.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purpose stated in Section 2, the expenditure of $52,500.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 2208 (ERA2), Dept-Div 44-10 (Administration Development), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes it.",
