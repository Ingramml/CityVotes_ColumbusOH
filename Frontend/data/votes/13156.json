    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with not-for-profit social service agencies for the Resilient Housing Initiative (RHI). See attached Exhibit A for the list of seven not-for-profit social services agencies included in this ordinance. The total amount awarded to these agencies is $479,000.00. The term of each Grant Agreement shall be a 6-month period beginning October 1, 2025.\n \nIt is the priority of the City to increase housing stability by helping residents stay housed and prevent displacement. Housing Stability is vital to our lives, contributing to social connection, health, and prosperity. Lack thereof contributes to disconnection, poor health outcomes, economic distress and—in the most critical situations—homelessness. The region is experiencing a housing crisis: our residents face rising rents, record rates of eviction, a lack of affordable housing, and an overburdened homeless shelter system. With these current realities, investing in homelessness prevention can limit housing crisis damage and relieve the impacts of emergency shelter stays.\n \nFederal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA2) ends September 30, 2025, leaving infrastructure in place to continue providing eviction and homelessness prevention to vulnerable residents of Columbus. The Resilient Housing Initiative (RHI) will continue homelessness prevention services through the first quarter of 2026 using local City of Columbus funding. The program includes housing crisis coaching, financial assistance, and housing-focused case management. RHI Service Providers will support eligible participants through each step of the program. The RHI Service Provider opportunity was made available to agencies that participated in the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA2)-funded Housing Resource Specialist program from 2023-2025. \n \nFunding will be advanced to each agency on a predetermined schedule. Advancement of funds is needed because many of the organizations do not have funding available to be reimbursed for program expenses. The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order. Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the grant agreement. Additionally, these programs/grant agreements may include reasonable food for participants of the programs which the expenditure is hereby deemed to be a valid public purpose in that such purchase will address the immediate needs of program participants.\n \nEmergency action is requested to provide emergency financial assistance to prevent eviction, homelessness and stabilize residents in a housing crisis.\n \nContract Compliance: See attached Exhibit A for a list of social services agencies and the vendor registration and contract compliance data.\n \nFiscal Impact: $479,000.00 is available within the Income Tax Set Aside (ITSA), contingent on the passage of ordinance 2449-2025, and Neighborhood Economic Development (NED) funds.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute grant agreements with seven not-for-profit, social service agencies identified in the attached Exhibit A in an amount up to $479,000.00 for the Resilient Housing Initiative; to authorize the payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages; to authorize expenses incurred prior to purchase order execution, beginning October 1, 2025; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule provided in the terms of the agreement; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $102,525.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $376,475.00 within the Income Tax Set Aside Fund; and to declare an emergency.
