    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City owns Franklin County Tax ID Parcel Nos. 010-054645 (the “NMDA Parcel”) and formerly owned 010-307276 as has been split and re-platted from time to time (the “Project Site”). North Market Development Authority, Inc. (“NMDA”) leases and operates a public market in a former warehouse (the “North Market”) on the NMDA Parcel. The City selected NM Developer LLC (the “Developer”) from a request for proposals to redevelop the Project Site with a 32-story mixed-use project. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 2135-2023 passed by City Council on July 24, 2023, the City entered into the First Amended and Restated Economic Development Agreement dated August 29, 2023 (the “Restated EDA”) with the NMDA and the Developer. Pursuant to the Restated EDA, the new development on the Project Site will include public parking spaces, an expansion of the North Market, a public atrium, patio, and plaza in support of the North Market, and other public improvements and site work described in the Restated EDA (collectively, the “Public Project”). Ordinance No. 2135-2023 also authorized the City to enter into the Cooperative Agreement dated August 29, 2023 (the “Cooperative Agreement”) with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to provide a portion of the financing for the Public Project (the “Public Improvements Grant”). Ordinance No. 3371-2023 authorized the first five million dollars of the Public Improvement Grant to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and Ordinance No. 3371-2024 authorized the next thirteen million dollars of said grant. This legislation will authorize amendments to the Restated EDA and the Cooperative Agreement to allow a more timely payment by the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority of a portion of the final $13 million dollars of the Public Improvement Grant to be remitted from the City to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority. It is necessary to certify the required funds, in the amount up to $13 million dollars against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099 and authorize the appropriation and transfer of the funds from the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund to the Development Taxable Bonds Fund. The funds will be reimbursed upon receipt of the bond proceeds.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in order to allow for the immediate payment to be made prior to the contractual deadlines per the agreements and amendments and such expedited payment is necessary for the Public Project to be completed on time prior to the deadline in the agreements.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this project will not be available to the Department of Development until the bonds are sold related to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget and are available at a future date, therefore it is necessary to certify the required funds, in the amount up to $13,000,000.00, against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. The fund will be reimbursed upon receipt of the bonds. There is sufficient budgetary authority for this project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize an amendment to the First Amended and Restated Economic Development Agreement dated August 29, 2023 with North Market Development Authority, Inc. and NM Developer LLC; to authorize an amendment to the Cooperative Agreement dated August 29, 2023 with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority; to authorize the appropriation of funds within the Income Set Aside Subfund and the Development Taxable Bonds Fund; to authorize the transfer of cash between the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Development Taxable Bonds Fund; to authorize the expenditure within the Development Taxable Bonds Fund in an amount up to $13,000,000.00 for the public improvements for the North Market project; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to remit a portion of the Public Improvements Grant to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority for the North Market public project pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement; and to declare an emergency.
