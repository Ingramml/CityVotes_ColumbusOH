    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the service contract with Synagro Central, LLC, for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project, CIP #690566-100001, in an amount up to $12,379,583.30.  \n \nThe purpose of the PAWP Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project is to provide services to remove, transport, and dispose of the water treatment residuals and grit-laden material from Lagoon 3. Residuals are the waste materials removed during the drinking water purification process.  Some of these materials will be disposed in a beneficial reuse manner as fertilizer or compost, while some of the materials will be taken to landfills for disposal.  This disposal preserves the existing lagoon to continue to be used for residual storage.  The cost of emptying Lagoon 3 of residuals is much less than it would cost to buy new land and build another residuals storage lagoon.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize a contract modification in the amount of up to $12,379,583.30 for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project.  The scope of work for the contract is not changing.  This is a planned modification to provide funding for a multi-year contract.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide.\n \n1.1  Estimated Cost of Project\nThe was an anticipated modification bid amount and proposed award amount is $41,379,583.30, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.\n \nCost summary: \nStage 1 funding (ORD 2704-2024, PO484694)                                                                    $      5,000,000.00\nModification 1 (current ORD 2186-2025, PO TBD)                                          $    12,379,583.30 \nModification 2 (future)                                                                                                         $    12,000,000.00\nModification 3 (future)                                                                                                         $    12,000,000.00\n \nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                              $   41,379,583.30\n \n1.2.  Reason other procurement processes are not used \nThis services contract was awarded per the City’s IFB process and approved via Ordinance 2704-2024 with planned modifications to add funding to continue the work.  This is the first of the funding modifications.  \n \n1.3.  How cost of the modification was determined\nThe cost of the modification was determined based upon one-third of the planned work remaining to be accomplished using the already approved contract rates. \n                     \n1.4  Timeline\nThe timeline remains as stated in the original contract.  All work shall be substantially complete within 1,580 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed (NTP), with Final Completion to occur within 1,610 calendar days of the NTP.  The NTP was issued on 1/15/25. \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe removal of residuals from Lagoon 3 will provide additional storage for residuals generated by the Parsons Avenue Water Plant.  This added capacity helps reduce the City’s risk of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System violation caused by discharges from the lagoons containing residuals, and is considerably less expensive than buying land and building a new storage lagoon.  There are no anticipated public meetings during this project. The Division of Water will be responsible for coordinating with stakeholders. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nSynagro Central, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC010213 and expires 5/23/26.   \n \n4.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nSynagro Central, LLC and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $12,379,583.30 is budgeted, available, and appropriated within the Water Operating Fund, Fund 6000.  \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the service contract with Synagro Central, LLC for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $12,379,583.30 from the Water Operating Fund.  ($12,379,583.30) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Parsons Avenue Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council authorized awarding the service contract for this project to Synagro Central, LLC via Ordinance 2704-2024, passed on 10/28/24; and\n \nWHEREAS, this contract was established with planned contract modifications to add funding for continued services to complete the contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify the services contract with Synagro Central, LLC for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 project for the first of the planned funding modifications; and\n \nWHEREAS, modification 1 will be used to add funding to the contract in the amount of $12,379,583.30; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for the services Synagro Central, LLC provides under this contract; NOW THEREFORE  \n  \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to modify the service contract for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant Residuals Removal and Disposal - Lagoon 3 with Synagro Central, LLC, 435 Williams Court, Suite 100, Baltimore, MD 21220, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Department of Public Utilities, in an amount up to $12,379,583.30.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $12,379,583.30, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized to pay for this contract modification per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
