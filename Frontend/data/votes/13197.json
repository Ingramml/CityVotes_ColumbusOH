    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Department of Finance and Management, Grants Management Section has received funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program. It is the goal of the CDBG program to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- to moderate-income people. \nThe City solicited CDBG-eligible project proposals for the 2023 program year. Columbus Next Generation Corporation submitted a proposal for CDBG funding for 2023 to support a transitional housing rehabilitation project at 2918 E. 5th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43219 (Project) with local non-profit, Ours Brothers Keepers, LLC. The City entered into a Subrecipient Agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation, serving as Project Manager and Fiscal Administrator for the Project, pursuant to Ordinance Number 3360-2022. The Project is eligible for CDBG funding due to the outcome of transitional housing rehabilitated, qualifying under the HUD Low- to Moderate-Income Housing National Objective. \nProject delays have required the City to modify the original Subrecipient Agreement twice to extend the agreement term. The original Subrecipient Agreement, as authorized by Ordinance 3360-2022 and modified by Ordinance 1501-2024 and 0803-2025, expired on July 31, 2025. \nThe City is still committed to accomplishing the Project for the outcome of providing transitional housing and space for administering services to at-risk youth. The City would like to enter into a new Subrecipient Agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation to ensure that the Project complies with a required HUD National Objective. There is $88,617.16 remaining on PO421338. This PO will be closed and the remaining balance of $88,617.16 will be put onto a new PO in connection with the new Subrecipient Agreement.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $88,617.16 from funding awarded to the City by HUD from Fund 2248. There is no impact to the General Fund as a result of this legislation. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a new Subrecipient Agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation, in order for the project to comply with HUD’s requirement to meet a National Objective as there has been a lapse of the original agreement which expired July 31, 2025, and to keep the lapse period as short as possible to ensure compliance with HUD regulations, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation in the amount of $88,617.16; to authorize the appropriation and the expenditure of $88,617.16; and to declare an emergency.
