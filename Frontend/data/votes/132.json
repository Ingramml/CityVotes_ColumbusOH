This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $80,000.00 in grant money for the period of September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021.\n \nThe purpose of this funding is to implement comprehensive sustainable interventions at the local level to prevent drug overuse, misuse, abuse, and overdose. The goal is to support local communities based on the needs identified within their community by providing resources for community coalitions and strategic plans, overdose fatality review boards, immediate community response plans and implementation of comprehensive sustainable systems in various settings to screen, identify and link at-risk populations with services. We have used this grant to formalize the Columbus & Franklin County Addiction Plan, with grant continuation focusing on coalition evaluation, as well as developing and implementing proposed changes for improvements on outcomes. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as emergency so a delay in services does not occur due to the start date September 1, 2020. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Drug Overdose Prevention Grant 2021 is fully funded ($80,000.00) by the Ohio Department of Health and does not require a City match. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Department of Health for the Drug Overdose Prevention Grant 2021 in the amount of $80,000.00; to authorize the appropriation of $80,000.00 to the Health Department in the Health Department’s Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($80,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS,  $80,000.00 in grant funds have been made available through the Ohio Department of Health for the Drug Overdose Prevention Grant 2021 for the period of September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds from the Ohio Department of Health for the support of the Drug Overdose Prevention Grant 2021; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health to meet deliverables and to appropriate these funds to Columbus Public Health for the immediate preservation of the public health, property, safety and welfare, and to avoid a delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $80,000.00 from the Ohio Department of Health for the Drug Overdose Prevention Grant 2021 for the period of September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department's Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the grant period, the sum of $80,000.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated upon receipt of an executed grant agreement to the Health Department, Division No. 5001, as indicated in the ordinance attachment.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.        \n        \nSECTION 4.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
