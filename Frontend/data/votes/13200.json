    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase PKS, Rotary and Lincoln Auto lifts with Leswego Corporation; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to purchase PKS, Rotary and Lincoln Auto lifts with Leswego Corportation DBA Anglin Equipment.  The Division of Fleet Management is the primary user for auto lifts. The installation of auto and truck lifts allow for City of Columbus personnel to elevate city owned vehicles for repair and service.  Leswego Corporation is the sole source for these parts and services as they are the only local distributor and authorized service provider for these specific three (3) manufacturers. The current contract expires on October 31, 2025. A lapse in contract would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Division of Fleet. Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n \nThe contract, PO290913 was established in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Code and authorized for extension under Ordinance Number 2484-2021 and will expire October 31, 2025.  The City and Leswego Corporation have agreed to modify and extend the contract for one additional year term subject to approval of proper City Authorities. The new contract expiration date will be October 31, 2026.  \n \nPer the requirements of Section 329.09(a) of City Code:\n(1) The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested. \n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A \n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: Any lapse in this contract would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Department of Technology. Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: The pricing has not changed. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contract.  The Division of Fleet must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation to be considered an emergency because the current contract expires October 31, 2025, and it is in the best interest of the City to modify and extend the contract to ensure the availability of the goods/services. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase PKS, Rotary and Lincoln Auto lifts with Leswego Corporation; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n  \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for PKS, Rotary and Lincoln Auto lifts for use by the Division of Fleet; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing Universal Term Contract with Leswego Corporation, to ensure PKS, Rotary and Lincoln Auto lifts are available to elevate city owned vehicles for repair and service; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Fleet in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract with Leswego Corporation for the option to purchase PKS, Rotary and Lincoln Auto lifts so that such services may continue uninterrupted as the current contract expires on October 31, 2025, all for the immediate preservation of the public property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore: \n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contract with Leswego Corporation, PO290913 for a period of (1) one year, from November 1, 2025 to and including October 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
