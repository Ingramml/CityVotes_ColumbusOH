If territory is detached from the city after adoption of the districting plan, council shall by ordinance, which shall be an emergency measure, amend the districting plan to detach the territory from the council district within which it previously resided. This ordinance amends the Columbus District Map to reflect any annexations that have been accepted since July 2024. \n \nPassage of this ordinance is contingent upon the passage of all ordinances outlined in Section 2. \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: Emergency action is requested in order to comply with Sec. 7-3 of the Columbus City Charter requiring that the ordinance amending a districting plan be an emergency measure as it is immediately necessary to authorize the adoption of this amended map to ensure that all residents that have been annexed into the City of Columbus are properly accounted for in time for the next general municipal election thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, or safety.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the Columbus District Map to reflect any annexations to the city since July 2024; and to declare an emergency. \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus voters overwhelmingly voted in support of Issue 3 in May 2018, to add two additional seats to City Council and create residential districts in the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, a five-member independent, citizen-led commission was seated prior to March 1, 2021 and charged with creating three Council residential districting plans in accordance with the Columbus City Charter (the “Charter”); and\n \nWHEREAS, the Charter mandated that the Commission follow specific requirements when creating the district map; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Charter mandated specific requirements for preserving the map; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in that the Charter requires that adoption of an amended map be passed as an emergency measure as it is immediately necessary to authorize the adoption of this amended map to ensure that all residents that have been annexed into the City of Columbus are properly accounted for in time for the next general, municipal election for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, or safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the City Council hereby recognizes its obligation under Section 7-3 of the Columbus City Charter to amend the Columbus District Map to include any annexations to the city.\n \nSECTION 2.
