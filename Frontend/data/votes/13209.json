    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\n The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Kieran Sherry, representative for Columbus State Community College asking that the City transfer them a 2,700 square foot (0.062 acre) portion of the right-of-way near E Spring Street.  The right-of-way area is north of Spring Street and east of Cleveland Avenue, abutted to the north by parcel 010-014105.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will allow the owner to incorporate it into the adjacent parcel to accommodate setback requirements for an upcoming development. The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $81,200.00 was established.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on July 17, 2025.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Columbus State Community College at the cost of $0.00 to them.\n                     \n2. FISCAL IMPACT\nThe Land Review Commission waived the cost, therefore, there is no fiscal impact to the City for transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of a 0.062 acre portion of right-of-way near E Spring St. to Columbus State Community College.
