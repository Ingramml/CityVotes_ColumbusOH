($267,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering / architectural services agreement with Abbot Studios architects + planners + designers, LLC (“Abbot Studios”) for the Watershed Facilities Improvements Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690525-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2177.\n \nWork under the initial contract (Step 1) provided a study and needs assessment service to identify rehabilitation/upgrade/repair needs and assisted the City in prioritizing these improvements by developing a project phasing plan for the facility improvements. \n \nContract Renewal No. 1 provided Step 2 - Detailed Design and Construction Bidding Services.\n \nThis Contract Renewal (No. 2) will provide Step 3 - Engineering Services During Construction.  \n \nThe Community Planning Area for this project is “99 - N/A” since the work services multiple community planning areas.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $267,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $ 196,000.00                     (PO077719)\nRenewal #1 (PO189134):                     $ 317,000.00\nRenewal #2 (current):                     $ 267,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal No’s 1-2):                     $ 780,000.00\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nStep 3 services were included in the RFP advertisement for which the Division received proposals in April 2017 from four interested firms.   The current consultant has since gained detailed knowledge of the site and existing facilities, and has completed the detailed design / construction documents.  Awarding this work to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the condition assessment and design work already performed, increasing project costs and extending the project schedule.\n \nHow cost of renewal was determined:\nAbbott Studios and the City developed a scope of work for Step 3 services based on the nature of the construction, the City’s needs, and the construction contract duration. Abbott Studios then developed the estimated level of effort / fee to perform the agreed to scope. The scope and fee were reviewed by the City PM and Abbott Studios, refining the agreement until a satisfactory scope, schedule, and fee was identified for both parties.\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nOccasional improvements are necessary to reduce excessive maintenance costs and extend the life of City buildings.  Upgrades and best practices to the administrative and field office facilities for Watershed Management were evaluated and considered for improvement. These improvements have positive environmental impacts and potential energy savings by improving the building envelopes, improving reliability of building mechanical systems and bringing facilities up to code, and addressing secure access for Watershed facilities.  The majority of the work will occur within areas that are not accessible to the public, so no community outreach is anticipated.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  31-1181520, expires 6/8/23, MAJ, DAX No. 4796.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Abbot Studios.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There are sufficient funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund - Fund No. 6006 for this expenditure.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering / architectural services agreement with Abbot Studios for the Watershed Facilities Improvements Project for the Division of Water; and to authorize an expenditure up to $267,000.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund.  ($267,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO077719 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1641-2017, passed July 17, 2017, was executed on August 21, 2017, and approved by the City Attorney on August 24, 2017, for the Watershed Facilities Improvements Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal No. 1 to Contract No. PO077719, identified as Contract No. PO189134 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1685-2019, passed July 19, 2019, was executed August 29, 2019, and signed by the City Attorney on August 30, 2019; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal #2 (current) is needed to provide Step 3 - Engineering Services During Construction; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering / architectural services agreement with Abbot Studios for the Watershed Facilities Improvements Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
