    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with    E. P Ferris & Associates, Inc.’s to add additional funds for the Pedestrian Safety - 17th Avenue ‐ I71 to Billiter Boulevard project.  \nOrdinance No. 1879-2024 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $800,000.00 professional services contract with E. P Ferris & Associates, Inc.’s for the Pedestrian Safety - 17th Avenue ‐ I71 to Billiter Boulevard project.   The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, improvements to existing sidewalk and curb along 17th Avenue from the I-71 southbound ramps to just west of Billiter Boulevard. Improvements include replacing the existing sidewalk, curb, driveways, ADA curb ramps, and resurfacing of 17th Avenue. Traffic signals at the I-71 NB ramps, Hamilton Avenue, and Cleveland Avenue will be replaced. Curb extensions will be constructed to protect parking. Surface drainage will be improved with modifications to the storm sewer. Existing water service lines containing lead or galvanized materials shall be replaced. Preliminary engineering will determine the sidewalk width, final locations and surface materials for the curb extensions, and where marked crosswalks are needed.\n \nOrd. 2534-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to submit MORPC Attributable Funds roadway improvement project applications and to execute project agreements for approved projects for the Department of Public Service for the Pedestrian Safety - 17th Avenue ‐ I71 to Billiter Boulevard project.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $400,000.00 for additional professional services to complete the detailed design of the project.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $400,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $800,000.00     (PO459964, Ord. 1879-2024)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $400,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $1,200,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification was anticipated. Task 1 was created to include all design services except R/W plans and retaining wall design. After negotiating Task 1, we knew we would need additional money because it exceeded the contract amount. The design cost for Task 2 - R/W plans and retaining walls were negotiated after preliminary alignment so that impacts and costs could be further understood.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis work is within the project limits of the original contract. It would be redundant to have a separate contract to perform this work, therefore, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the Ciy to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by an internal review of the work proposed and the suggested hours proposed by the consultant. The fee was negotiated and reasonable based on other projects of similar size and scope.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against E. P Ferris and Associates, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for E. P Ferris & Associates, Inc. is CC004823 and expires 05/01/2027.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $400,000.00 is budgeted, available, and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to continue the construction plan design. Plan design will affect the Right of Way design that needs to stay on schedule in order to be completed to meet the funding deadline for acquisition to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with E.
