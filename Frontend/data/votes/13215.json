    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with Student Success Stores, a non-profit corporation with the goal to meet the basic needs of students from economically disadvantaged communities, and to remove barriers to learning that can be created when life necessities are unavailable.\nStudent Success Stores has been providing students with free school supplies, personal hygiene products, nutritional food, school-code clothing, and more since 2016.
