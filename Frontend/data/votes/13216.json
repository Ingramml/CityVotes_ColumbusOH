    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Sessley Building Services LLC for the Beatty Community Center Renovations Project. The contract amount of $350,000.00 is being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Beatty Community Center, located at 247 North Ohio Avenue, dates to the construction of the gymnasium in 1926 and includes building additions constructed in 1951, 1966, and 2004. A fire broke out in the gymnasium on August 22, 2024. This incident led to fire and smoke damage throughout the building.  \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department will deliver this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) delivery method. This method will enable the immediate start of remediation services while the design team completes the drawings and specifications for construction.  This initial agreement is to begin executing repairs resulting from the fire and additional services to implement space for teen programming at Beatty Community Center. This work will include early construction activities such as hazardous material remediation and procurement of long-lead items. There will be one additional planned modification to the contract for the full Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), to be submitted once the project has been fully designed and the subcontractor packages bid. The full construction cost of this project is estimated to be $3.1 million.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on June 3, 2025 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on July 1, 2025. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nSessley Building Services LLC\n2K General\nAscension Construction Services\nHGC Construction\nMarker Construction\nMartin Painting Services\nSetterlin Building Company\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Sessley Building Services was the lowest and most responsive bidder.
