    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with O.A. Spencer, Inc. for the North Star Playground Project. The modification will add additional funding and extend the contract term. The additional funding being authorized by this ordinance is $133,529.00, with a contingency of $16,471.00, for a total of $150,000.00.\n \nThis modification involves detailed design, including the preparation of construction plans and specifications. It will also involve permits and bidding documents. The North Star Playground Project seeks to capture the historical, cultural, and geographical relevance of the hidden passage to freedom through the installation of thematic playground equipment and safety surfacing. This project will create the opportunity to educate visitors about an important time in history. It will also engage all ages and abilities in physical activity and play. This portion of the project is now called North Star. The original project completion date of the project was October 17, 2025. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, will be March 13, 2026.  \n \nThe Alum Creek Corridor served as a major hidden passage to freedom route for enslaved people to escape from the south to the north in the decades leading up to the American Civil War. The Recreation and Parks Department is seeking to highlight this time in history and how it has shaped the region. The Department plans to accomplish this through a series of installments in the parks and trails along the Alum Creek Corridor. The Department intends to develop a new installation annually, unveiling the design each February during Black History Month. North Star will be located on the south side of the Hayden Park parcel and will be the first of these installations. Alum Creek Greenway Trail is to the east, Nelson Road on the west, and a piece of land owned by the Columbus Metropolitan Library will serve as the connector trail to the amenities from Shepard Library. \n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $150,000.00\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: The original parcel where this project was planned is now being utilized by Columbus Metropolitan Library and is unavailable to the Recreation and Parks Department. The design will be relocated to the adjacent Hayden Park rather than the library parcel. These funds cover the redesign needed due to the relocation. \n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: The design started in November 2024. We were informed recently that we no longer have access to the parcel where the project was originally planned.  It is in the best interest that the contract is modified so that the design process is not interrupted. Most of the design that is already complete is not impacted by the changed site location. This modification allows for the completed work that is transferable to still be used.  \n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The rates were established in the original contract to determine the fee. The hours needed to finish the scoped tasks were reviewed and approved by the Recreation and Parks Department.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nO.A. Spencer, Inc.\n343 East Livingston Avenue \nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nOthelda Spencer, (614) 461-1035\nContract Compliance Number: 005585\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 24, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to minimize project interruption after being informed that the original site location is no longer available and an adjacent parcel will be used instead.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will provide cultural, educational, and recreational opportunities for the public.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The inspiration for this project came from a community request.\n \nArea(s) Affected: North Central (49)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing equitable outdoor play opportunities for the public.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $200,924.00 was legislated for the North Star Playground Project by Ordinance 2707-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $150,000.00. $150,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $350,924.00. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with O.A.
