($310,065.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The HVAC & Air Purification Units in the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant East Aeration Building are approaching the end of their useful life and are becoming increasingly difficult to repair and maintain.  Furthermore the current configuration is inefficient and over complex. The initial contract for preliminary engineering has been completed to analyze the space being served, calculate heating demands, sample for H2S, determine air purification needs, and investigate challenges with fitting the proposed equipment into the existing space. A detailed design memorandum has been created, and future scope of work will depend on these results.  This renewal will design the bid package for construction and a future renewal will provide professional services during construction.\n \nCommunity Planning Area:  64 Far South\n \nRenewal Information:     \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $310,065.00\n        Original Contract (preliminary design, competed)                                                                  $121,506.83\n        Renewal 1 (detailed design, current renewal)                                                                   $310,065.00\n        Future Anticipated Needs are Services During Construction                          $240,000.00\n        CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                  $671,571.83\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen.\nRenewals were planned in the original contract legislation, ORD. 0933-2020.\n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nSubstantial information and knowledge has been developed by the consultant through work performed during the first three years of work on this engineering agreement.  If the work to be performed under this modification was to be bid out separately, tasks already completed would be performed repetitively causing significant delays and incurring additional cost.  Also delays would put the City at risk of missing consent order deadlines.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nA scope of services, consistent with the original proposal and contract, was developed and fee was negotiated between the City and consultant.\n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: It is anticipated that this renewal will be for a term of 2 years.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n    \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  31-1612308 | MAJ | Exp. 4/7/2022 | Vendor # 005665\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: This project is necessary for replacement of failing HVAC and Air Purification systems at the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant facility.  Environmental benefits will likely be inherent in the project, because newly designed units will be likely be more energy efficient.  No community outreach or input is believed to be necessary.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $310,065.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. for the Southerly East Aeration Control Building HVAC and Air Purification Project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $310,065.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund. ($310,065.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to renew an existing engineering agreement with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. for the Southerly East Aeration Control Building HVAC and Air Purification Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $310,065.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Fund, Fund 6109; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. in connection with the Southerly East Aeration Control Building HVAC and Air Purification Project, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to renew an existing professional engineering service agreement with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd., 1405 Dublin Rd., Columbus, OH 43215, for the Southerly East Aeration Control Building HVAC and Air Purification Project in accordance with the terms and conditions as shown in the contract on file in the office of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSection 2.  That the Director is hereby authorized to expend up to $310,065.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109 per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That said company, Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd., shall conduct the work to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Utilities and the Administrator of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project account by monies from more than one source.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
