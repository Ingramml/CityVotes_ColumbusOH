    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with KUBRA Data Transfer, Ltd. for Bill Presentment services. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $9,000.00.\nThe City of Columbus (hereafter also referred to as “Client”) has approximately 300,000 water meters and 18,500 electric meters that serve approximately 1.2 million people with a projected growth of about 1% or less per year. Client produces annual water sales of approximately $234 million, sewer sales of $286 million, and electric sales of $85 million respectively. The Client remains primarily a residential community with approximately 94% of its meters being residential customers and 6% being commercial and industrial customers.\nKUBRA will provide bill presentment services for the Department of Public Utilities which includes the printing and mailing of service bills for the approximate 1.2 million, and growing, customers of the City’s water, sewer, and electric services. The bill presentment service will also include the ability to access bills electronically. This new system will replace the current bill presentment solution with Doxim in 2026. After this initial contract for the testing service portion of the contract, the Department of Public Utilities intends to modify this contract with KUBRA annually for billing services. \nFor this testing phase contract, KUBRA will perform test bill production runs prior to implementation including up to multiple days of full volume.

This contract will not automatically renew. The initial contract funding of $9,000.00 is for the testing portion of this contract, a modification is expected in early 2026 to authorize the funding for the first full year, April 1st, 2026 to and including March 31st, 2027, of the contract. \nThis ordinance authorizes the initial term of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\nProcurement:  \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive proposals through Vendor Services and Bonfire from September 27th, 2024 to October 18th, 2024 for Bill Presentment Services in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code, RFQ028833.
