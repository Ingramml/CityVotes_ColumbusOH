    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend an earlier ordinance authorizing the execution of a service contract between the Department of Public Service and Routeware, Inc. for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection fleet.\n \nRouteware, Inc. offers an on-demand routing solution, which enhances efficiencies for the Division of Refuse Collection by providing a streamlined option to develop optimized bulk collection and container management routes each day. Refuse drivers receive the routing instructions through iPhones leased by Routeware, Inc., and the routes are developed through an online portal that will pull in all relevant information for that day. The phones also allow the drivers to take before and after pictures to confirm service. This allows the Division of Refuse Collection to maximize efficiencies and to assess streets for pot holes, illegal dumping, and other street maintenance, as the vehicles travel around their assigned routes.\n \nOrdinance 1911-2025 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter a service contract with Routeware, Inc. and to expend up to $147,576.00 to support associated software subscription and maintenance costs. While that agreement was intended to be a one-year contract, with two, one-year renewal options, which was noted in the Bid Waiver section of that legislation, language conferring that authority was not included in the Be It Ordained section of that same ordinance. This legislation seeks to correct that omission. \n \nThis legislation also seeks to authorize the Department of Public Service to make payment to Routeware, Inc. for services rendered between April 1, 2025, and September 30, 2025, during which time the parties were engaged in contract negotiations.     \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Routeware, Inc. is CC030689, which expires September 1, 2027.  \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nAn Auditor’s Certificate, ACPO012174, has been established, pursuant to Ordinance 1911-2025, to compensate Routeware, Inc. for the services described herein.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the service contract so as to avoid a lapse in essential services. \n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance 1911-2025 so as to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute a one-year service contract, with two 1-year renewal options, with Routeware, Inc. for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection; to authorize the reimbursement of expenses incurred between April 1, 2025, and September 30, 2025, during which time the parties were engaged in contract negotiations; and to declare an emergency.
