    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to enter into grant agreements with recipients of the Department of Development, Division of Housing’s Critical Home Repair Program and to make payments directly to the contractor who performed the work.  The Department desires to encumber $700,000.00 of bond funds for this program and will enter into multiple agreements under the authority of this ordinance.\n \nThe Critical Home Repair Program is open to households up to 80% AMI with the exception of veteran households, which may go up to 120% AMI.  Households apply and if the application is approved, then City staff write the specifications for the project and publicly advertise through Bid Express.  The homeowner makes a selection from the bids received that are within 15% of the estimate prepared by the City.  The City then enters into a grant agreement with the homeowner, the homeowner signs the contract with the contractor, but the City pays the contractor directly.\n \nCritical Home Repair projects include things like roofs, windows (as necessary for security purposes) and doors, and mechanical repairs for emergency situations (i.e. faulty/dangerous electric, no heat, clogged sewer mains).  As the program has evolved, the department has learned that some critical home repair projects are more involved than originally expected, resulting in additional costs unanticipated by the homeowner, City, and the contractor.  As such, the Director is also seeking authority to modify Critical Home Repair contracts as issues are discovered, up to the amount of funds remaining on the ACPO.  This will allow the department to immediately authorize the additional work needed without stopping work to seek Council approval for a contract modification.\n \nThis is a long-standing program provided by the Division of Housing and approval will be requested, as needed, to continue funding the program. \n \n \nFiscal Impact: $700,000.00 is available in the 2024 Capital Improvement Budget, Affordable Housing bond fund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the expenditure of up to $700,000.00 of Affordable Housing Bonds; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into multiple grant agreements with recipients of the Department of Development, Division of Housing’s Critical Home Repair Program and to make payments directly to the contractor who performed the work; and to modify grant agreements funded from this ordinance as necessary to complete the project. ($700,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to encumber and be authorized to expend up to $700,000.00 of bond funds for the Division of Housing’s Critical Home Repair Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, under the Critical Home Repair Program, the City enters into a grant agreement with the homeowner, the homeowner enters into contract with the contractor, and the City pays the contractor directly; and\n \nWHEREAS, Critical Home Repair projects include repairs to roofs, windows (as necessary for security purposes) and doors, and mechanical repairs for emergency situations (i.e. faulty/dangerous electric, no heat, clogged sewer mains); and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director also seeks authority to modify Critical Home Repair grant agreements as issues are discovered, up to the amount remaining on the ACPO, allowing the department to immediately authorize the additional work needed without stopping work to seek Council approval for a grant agreement modification; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n                     \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to enter into multiple grant agreements with recipients of the Department of Development, Division of Housing’s Critical Home Repair Program, to make payments directly to the contractor who performed the work, and to modify grant agreements and purchase orders with the contractor, funded from this ordinance as necessary to complete the project, up to the amount remaining on this ACPO.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the purpose as stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $700,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized in fund 7779 (Affordable Housing), Project 782023-100000, Dept. 44-10 (Housing), in Object Class 06 (Capital Outlay) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n                                          \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
