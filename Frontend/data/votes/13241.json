    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement (Modification No. 1) with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $144,000.00 to provide time-limited payments of unrestricted funds to individuals engaged in an economic mobility initiative that is supported by a non-profit organization.  As it was authorized with the original agreement, this grant modification will include advancement of funds per a pre-determined schedule.\n \nOriginal                                       $ 578,700.00                            Ord. 2906-2024                      PO484610\nMod 1                                                                     $ 144,000.00                     \nTotal                                            $ 722,700.00         \n \nThe public purpose of this agreement and modification is to continue a partnership with The Tony R. Wells Foundation to integrate economic mobility accelerators (Accelerators) with the work of several nonprofit organizations. Accelerators are time-limited payments of unrestricted funds to individuals engaged in an economic mobility initiative that is supported by a non-profit organization. The Tony R. Wells Foundation will make the payments directly to the individuals. This modification provides additional funds to increase the number of participants able to benefit from Accelerators. The Wells Foundation also oversees an independent evaluation that will provide recommendations for improving, scaling and replicating the initiative.\n \nIn today’s post-COVID economy, many Columbus residents are challenged with making ends meet, yet they continue to work hard to increase their income and attain economic stability. Challenges to achieving economic stability include stagnant wages and rising costs (e.g. housing, childcare, and food).  These conditional cash transfers to residents participating in economic mobility initiatives will accelerate their economic mobility.\n \nBy increasing financial security, individuals can experience improved health and well-being as stress, anxiety and depression are decreased. Stability in housing and employment enables better outcomes for children in health, education and social connection. Moving toward greater economic stability can shape one’s opportunities and aspirations with promises of a better future.\n \nThe public purpose of this agreement is to establish a partnership with The Tony R. Wells Foundation to integrate economic mobility accelerators within the work of several nonprofit organizations. Accelerators are time-limited payments of unrestricted funds to individuals engaged in an economic mobility initiative that is operated by a non-profit organization.\n \nThe Tony R. Wells Foundation will make the payments directly to the individuals.  They will also provide each recipient with a 1099.  A portion of the grant amount will account for the administration fee for the Foundation’s services.  In addition, the Tony R. Wells Foundation will oversee an independent evaluation to provide recommendations for improving, scaling and replicating the initiative.\n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of the additional funds to be expended is $144,000.00.\n2.                     The Department of Development could not precisely predict the number of individuals that would participate in these economic mobility programs.\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to continue with the Tony R Wells Foundation’s current contract as they are already performing this work with nonprofit organizations. \n4.                     The amount of this modification is based on the availability of funds and not a pricing strategy.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding of $144,000.00 is available in Fund 2237, Neighborhood Economic Development Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s number is 038668 and expires on 05/22/2027.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $144,000.00 to provide time-limited payments of unrestricted funds to individuals engaged in an economic mobility initiative that is supported by a non-profit organization; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $144,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development Fund; and to authorize advance payments per a predetermined schedule.
