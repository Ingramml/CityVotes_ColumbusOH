    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Claire Weisz Architects LLP DBA WXY Architecture + Urban Design for the Linden Green Line Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $900,000.00.\n \nThe Linden Green Line represents an unprecedented opportunity to create a 58-acre linear park through one of Central Ohio’s most park underserved areas, impacting over 131,000 nearby residents. This corridor stretches from Windsor Park, near 17th Avenue, to Cooper Park in Northland. It will feature a 10 to 12 foot wide ADA-accessible multi-use path framed by native forests, meadows, and open green spaces. It will also have more than 40 potential access points to neighboring communities. Small-scale amenities such as play spaces, gathering areas, seating, and fitness elements will be integrated throughout the trail system and will be designed with community input.\n \nThis preliminary engineering phase will establish the vision and framework for the park. It will include design concepts. It will also include access and connectivity strategies. Also included will be ecological restoration plans, preliminary plans, cost estimates, and permitting strategies. An economic development study to evaluate how the project can support neighborhoods, stimulate reinvestment, and connect residents to new opportunities will also be included.\n \nA central component of this phase is a robust community engagement plan for the Linden and Northland Communities. Activities will include public workshops, interviews, tabling at community hubs, and guided corridor walks. Additional physical and digital outreach will also be included to ensure broad diverse participation. Input gathered through these efforts will inform design priorities, preferred amenities, and overall park planning.\n \nConstruction will be implemented in two or three phases. Claire Weisz Architects LLP DBA WXY Architecture + Urban Design will evaluate potential phasing limits and provide recommendations within the preliminary engineering scope. This legislation is the initial piece of several planned modifications to complete full design. The next modification for detailed design is anticipated in spring 2026. Recreation and Parks plans to bid the first phase of construction in fall 2027 and the second phase in fall 2028. \n \nFunding for the project is well underway. Recreation and Parks received a $12 million Federal RAISE grant in mid 2025 and has approximately $15 million in LinkUS funding for construction. Altogether, the construction budget is approximately $27 million. Together with future City investment, the Linden Green Line will provide environmental, social, and economic benefits. It will also advance Columbus’ broader mobility, equity, and sustainability goals. This project will establish the corridor as both a neighborhood asset and a regional destination.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Bids were advertised through Vendor Services and Bonfire, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 13, 2025, and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 24, 2023.

This complex project requires sufficient time for the design team to complete the master planning and preliminary design work, ensuring the project is thoroughly planned, community-informed, and ready for phased construction. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will provide seven linear miles of trail and 58 acres of park space to the Linden and Northland Communities. It will impact over 131,000 people within a ten-minute walking and cycling distance. This project will also connect residents with neighborhoods by providing safe pedestrian and bicycle routes. Lastly, it increase access to nature and park amenities. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Over 100 letters of support were received from various organizations and elected officials. The project team will also conduct a robust public engagement session with the community to inform planning and design.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by expanding equitable access to parks, schools, natural areas, jobs, and civic destinations. \n \nFiscal Impact: $900,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 and Voted Bond Fund 7712 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. $508,000.00 of the funds, in Voted Bond Fund 7712, will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date.
