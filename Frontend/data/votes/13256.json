    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with the Columbus Museum of Art for the administration and implementation of their roof replacement project. The amount being authorized by this ordinance is $1,000,000.00.\n \nThe Columbus Museum of Art requested capital support from the City of Columbus in 2024 to help fund the replacement of their roof. The roof over the Columbus Museum of Art’s primary structure, which houses their art galleries, is past its useful life. Installed over 30 years ago, the roof has allowed water to seep into the Elizabeth M. and Richard M. Ross Building and has resulted in water damage to the internal decorative plaster ceiling, lighting, and floors. Further water damage may potentially impact the works of art themselves. \n \nReplacing the existing roof with a new modern roof will cost approximately $4.5 million. The construction project will include removing the current aluminum roofing structure and replacing it with a combination flat rubber and copper standing seam roof. A copper standing seam roof was selected since the metal was the original material installed on the building in 1931.\n \nTo assist with financing the construction project, the Museum was awarded $1 million from the City of Columbus. This public financing request is in addition to financing requested from the State of Ohio ($2 million) and the Franklin County Commissioners ($1 million). The Museum will seek private donations for any portion of the project that does not receive public financing.\n \nPrincipal Parties:\nColumbus Museum of Art\n480 East Broad Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nNon-Profit Organization\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow the Columbus Museum of Art to keep construction on schedule, keeping the impact to facility operations to a minimum, and allowing the improvements to be utilized by the community as soon as possible; the funding authorized by this legislation is in addition to funding to be received from other sources needed for the roof replacement that will cost approximately $4.5 million.\n \nBenefits to the Public: These improvements will benefit the community by enhancing the visitor experience, creating a more attractive destination for Central Ohio residents and beyond. The Museum of Art and the surrounding public grounds are an asset to the entire Central Ohio community. \n \nCommunity Input Issues: Based on research and surveys conducted by the Greater Columbus Arts Council, most Columbus residents think it’s important for the city to financially support the arts and believe the arts greatly enhance the city’s quality of life.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  The entire City of Columbus, Central Ohio, and beyond will benefit from these improvements, adding to the quality of life for citizens and creating an attractive environment for industry.\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  This project supports the mission of the Recreation and Parks by enhancing the quality of life of our citizens.  The Master Plan’s focus on creating improved facilities is supported by these improvements. \n \nFiscal Impact: $1,000,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7712 to meet the financial obligations of this contract. The funds will not be available to the Recreation and Parks Department until the proceeds of the 2024-2025 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds against the General Fund 1000, Income Tax Set Aside Subfund 100099. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Columbus Museum of Art for the administration and implementation of their roof replacement project in the amount of $1,000,000.00; to authorize the transfer of $1,000,000.00 between the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation of $1,000,000.00 in the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $1,000,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
