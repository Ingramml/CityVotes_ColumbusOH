    "description": "...Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \nColumbus Public Health received additional grant carryover funds for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program, referenced in Ordinance No. 0151-2025. The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program is funded from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), with funds originating from the Department of Health and Human Services. This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into an initial contract with qualified vendor, Health Access LLC, to establish a system for efficient grant monitoring activities, thus ensuring any that implementation of program activities comply with HRSA policies and local service standards. The term of the contract is October 1, 2025 through February 28, 2026. \n \nEffective program implementation requires a mechanism to monitor and hold service providers accountable for implementing programs in compliance with HRSA policies and local service standards. These funds were approved by the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program funder, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), via a carryover request detailing grant funds devoted to establishing a system for an efficient monitoring system for Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant, similar to what is utilized for the Ryan White program. Under the terms of the grant, funds must be used during the grant period or they are forfeited and CPH may be subject to penalties related to future grant funding. Health Access, LLC is a for profit agency and a bid waiver is requested for this ordinance due to time constraints of the current grant cycle and need for continuation of service based grant requirements referenced above. This bid waiver is requested according to bidding requirements of the City Code 329. \n \nHealth Access, LLC CC-042931: $75,000.00\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that quality medical care continues to be available to eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS and to ensure timely payment to providers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAll expenditures are budgeted in the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Grant Program within the Health Department Grant Fund.
