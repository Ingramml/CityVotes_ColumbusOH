    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:                     \n \nThis Ordinance is submitted to settle the lawsuit known as Treadway, v. City of Columbus, et al., pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Case No. 2:22-cv-2287, in the amount of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and zero cents ($125,000.00). In late May of 2020, protests and civil unrest erupted across the country in response to the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Protests began in the City of Columbus on May 28, 2020, and lasted throughout the summer of 2020 (the “George Floyd Protests”). \n \nThis lawsuit arises out of an incident that occurred on May 30, 2020. Plaintiff Gaige Treadway brings claims against Defendants Michael Ramsey, James Long, the City of Columbus, and “Unknown Officers.” Plaintiff alleges that he attended the George Floyd Protests on May 30, 2020, wearing a gas mask. Plaintiff alleges that now-retired Sergeant Michael Ramsey removed his gas mask because he displayed the middle finger, and that he was arrested and charged for assaulting Sergeant Michael Ramsey without probable cause. Plaintiff’s allegations are fully described in the Amended Complaint filed on June 8, 2022. Plaintiff brings claims under Section 1983, alleging excessive force, false arrest, malicious prosecution, and violation of his First Amendment rights. He also brings a state-law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Prior to entering into this Settlement Agreement, the Court dismissed several of Plaintiff’s claims, including all claims against the City, Officer James Long, and the “Unknown Officers.” The only remaining claims in this case were Plaintiff’s First Amendment and excessive force claims against Michael Ramsey for removing Plaintiff's gas mask.\n \nFiscal Impact:                     \n \nFunds were not specifically budgeted for this settlement; however, sufficient monies are available within the Department of Finance’s Citywide Account for this purpose. \n \nEmergency action is requested for this ordinance to be effective immediately in accordance with the terms of the settlement of this lawsuit, which is in the best interest of the City, and to pay the agreed to sum without delay.\n \nTitle                     \n \nTo authorize and direct the City Attorney to settle the lawsuit known as Treadway v. City of Columbus, et al., pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Case No. 2:22-cv-2287; to authorize the expenditure of the sum of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars and zero cents ($125,000.00) in settlement of this lawsuit; to authorize the transfer of $125,000.00 within the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
