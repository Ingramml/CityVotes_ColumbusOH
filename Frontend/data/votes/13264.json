    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract through the City’s RFP process with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc for professional engineering services for the Southerly Water Reclamation Plant (SWRP) Switching Station Replacement project, CIP #650346-100004, in an amount up to $4,622,182.00. \n \nThis project is for Design Development services and will include a basis of design report, preliminary design report and 30% design drawings for the design and installation of a new Main Switching Station, Northeast Switching Station, Southeast Switching Station, and Raw Sewage Pump Switching Station.  It will eventually also include relocation of the Division of Power (DOP) Substation, and radial distribution electrical system routing for the facility. \n \nThis project will be completed utilizing the Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) delivery method.\n \nTwo future modifications will be requested. One modification will be requested at the completion of design development and a second will be requested for services during construction.\n \nCommunity Planning Area:  64 - Far South\nTIMELINE:  The Design Development Services portion of the contract is anticipated to be completed within 12 months of issuing the notice to proceed.  The notice to proceed is expected to be issued in October 2025 and the Design Development portion is scheduled to conclude in September of 2026. A future modification will be requested for the remainder of the design (Preconstruction Services). A second modification will be requested for Engineering Services during Construction. Currently, construction is anticipated to be for two years, concluding in September 2029.  These are all estimated timelines.  Work will continue on each phase until the work is completed and accepted by the City, even if this means work has to continue past an expected completion date. \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The proposed award amount is $4,622,182.00, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work. Future contract modifications are anticipated.\n                     \n         Original Contract (current)         $4,622,182.00\n                     Modification #1 (future)          $7,000,000.00\n                     Modification #2 (future)                              $7,000,000.00                 \n         CONTRACT TOTAL              $18,622,182.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nReplacing the switching stations reduces the likelihood of unplanned emergency replacements and the costs associated with them. This project will prepare for anticipated future power distribution needs through the sizing of the new gear. Additionally, the new main switching station will allow the new cogeneration facility to operate effectively, increasing the reuse capacity of the plant. The new DOP substation will be sized to accommodate growth within the plant and will move inside of the 100 year floodway to protect this critical infrastructure.\n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from 2/14/2025 through 3/28/2025.   Two proposals were received:\n \nName                                              C.C.
