    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & DeHaven, Inc. dba GPD Group for the 69-2 Circuit Improvements Project, CIP #670608-100015, in an amount up to $1,153,133.82 for the Division of Power.\n \nThe 69-2 Circuit Improvements project will upgrade a 50-year old transmission circuit.  This circuit is 9.7 miles long and stretches from our Southerly Substation to our Jackson Pike Substation.  Some of the line has already been upgraded but 8.3 miles of this circuit still need to be reconductored with newer, larger wire to extend the useful life of this circuit and to provide additional capacity for increased current from a planned solar field.  \n \nThe contract scope of work includes project management, field survey, detailed design, preparation of construction drawings, obtaining permits necessary for the work, engineering services during construction, and preparation of record plan drawings.  An assessment of the existing circuit infrastructure will also be performed to include poles, lightning arrestors, and anything deemed necessary to meet National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) requirements and proper transmission pole line design.\n \nThis project spans across three Columbus Communities: “64 - Far South”, “63 - South Side”, and “59 - Southwest”.  \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,153,133.82\nOriginal Contract                                                               $ 1,526,280.03 (PO431813, ORD 3200-2023)\nContract Modification #1                                        $ 1,153,133.82 (Current)\nFuture Contract Modification #2                  $ 1,000,000.00                                                                                                         \nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $ 3,679,413.85\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used  \nThis is the first of two planned contract modifications to add funding for continued work as stated in Ordinance 3200-2023.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined\nCosts are based upon existing contract hourly titles, pay rates, allowable expenses, and an estimate of what is needed to complete the scope of work.\n \n1.4. Timeline\nThere is no change in the estimated timeline at this time.  The contract started in early 2024 and is estimated to end in 2030.  The actual contract end date will be when construction services during construction are no longer needed for this project.    \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis project will construct a more resilient and reliable power distribution system.  This will result in fewer power interruptions to the customers on this circuit, reducing economic impacts due to power outages.  The improvements to this circuit will allow a reliable path for power to be transmitted from solar fields on the south end of Columbus to the core Division of Power service territory.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nGPD Group’s contract compliance number is CC006560 and expires 6/23/2027.\n \nAs part of their proposal, GPD Group has proposed that no subcontractors will be use to perform contract work.\n \nThe certification of GPD Group was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding is budgeted, available, and appropriated within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  Cash and appropriation need to be transferred between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with GPD Group for the 69-2 Circuit Improvements Project; to authorize an amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation within the Electricity Bond Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $1,153,133.82 within the Electricity Bond Fund to pay for the contract modification.
