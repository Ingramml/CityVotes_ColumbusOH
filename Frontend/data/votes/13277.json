    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize and Celebrate Chad Dworkin as the 2025 Recipient of the Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio’s Outstanding Pro Bono Collaboration Award\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Chad Dworkin is the 2025 recipient of the Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio’s Outstanding Pro Bono Collaboration Award; and \n                     \nWHEREAS, Chad’s path to pro bono work began in childhood. Raised in Columbus, he watched his parents volunteer tirelessly-his father as an EMT and both parents with the Red Cross; and\n \nWHEREAS, Today, Chad balances a busy family life with volunteering, and his free time is filled with their sports schedules, coaching travel softball, skiing, and even serving as a volunteer ski patroller; and \n \nWHEREAS, Together, along with Gretchen Lipari, the Nationwide trial attorneys take on pro bono cases that change lives-one family at a time; and\n \nWHEREAS, Both attorneys emphasize how critical LASCO’s work is and are being recognized for strengthening one another’s work. They credit Nationwide for making their service possible. The company’s partnership with LASCO and Nationwide Children’s Hospital’s Lawyers for Kids provides resources, encouragement, and structure; and \n \nWHEREAS, Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio, in conjunction with the Ohio Poverty Law Center, is committed to searching out the patterns, causes of, and solutions to the repetitive and fundamental legal problems facing low-income Ohioans and pursuing the legal recourse needed to address those problems; and \n \nWHEREAS, Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio is comprised of advocates who are passionate about providing legal services to low-income individuals, and it is an honor and a privilege to work with an organization that is committed to making the daily lives of Columbus residents better - a fact exemplified by the service of people such as Chad Dworkin; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council recognizes and celebrates Chad Dworkin as the 2025 Recipient of the Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio’s Outstanding Pro Bono Collaboration Award.",
