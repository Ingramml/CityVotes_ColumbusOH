    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize and Celebrate Frederick D. Benton, Jr., L.P.A. as the 2025 Recipient of the Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio’s Pro Bono Powerhouse Award\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Frederick D. Benton, Jr., L.P.A. is the 2025 recipient of Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio’s Pro Bono Powerhouse Award; and \n \nWHEREAS, Benton graduated from St. Joseph’s University with a degree in English Literature. He earned his law degree from Capital University Law School in 1980, then established his own law office in Columbus’ historic King-Lincoln District, where he practices primarily criminal law; and\n \nWHEREAS, Benton, president and CEO of Frederick D. Jr., L.P.A., has volunteered for over a decade at free legal clinics in Columbus and encourages others to do the same. He began volunteering at clinics hosted by Mt. Olivet Baptist Church through the Urban Resurrection Community Development Corporation, which later partnered with LASCO; and\n \nWHEREAS, Through his volunteer work with LASCO, Benton says his belief in the power of lawyers to create change has only grown stronger. Beyond that belief, he views it as a lawyer's duty to broaden access to justice. By mentoring colleagues and encouraging them to give back, he has multiplied the impact of his own service; and\n \nWHEREAS, For Benton, his leadership and mentorship are grounded in a simple truth and his leadership has extended far beyond the courtroom, changing the lives of clients and shaping the career paths of his fellow lawyer; and\n \nWHEREAS, Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio, in conjunction with the Ohio Poverty Law Center, is committed to searching out the patterns, causes of, and solutions to the repetitive and fundamental legal problems facing low-income Ohioans and pursuing the legal recourse needed to address those problems; and \n \nWHEREAS, Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio is comprised of advocates who are passionate about providing legal services to low-income individuals, and it is an honor and a privilege to work with an organization that is committed to making the daily lives of Columbus residents better - a fact exemplified by the service of people such as Frederick D. Benton, Jr., L.P.A.; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council recognizes and celebrates Frederick D. Benton, Jr., L.P.A. as the 2025 Recipient of Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio’s Pro Bono Powerhouse Award.",
