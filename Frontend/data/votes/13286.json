    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Voice, Video, and Data, Cabling Hardware, and Services with E2 Optics LLC; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to purchase Voice, Video, Data, Cabling Hardware, and Services with E2 Optics LLC.  The Department of Technology is the primary user for voice, video, and data services. Cabling hardware, and Services are used to maintain, relocate and repair interior network cabling. An RFQ process is needed to establish a new contract. The current contract expires on October 31, 2025 and there is not enough time to use a procurement process to award a new contract. A lapse in contract would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Department of Technology. Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n \nThe contract, PO295133 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ019419 and authorized for extension under Ordinance Number 2484-2021 and will expire October 31, 2025.  The City and E2 Optics LLC have agreed to modify and extend the contract for one additional year term subject to approval of proper City Authorities. The new contract expiration date will be October 31, 2026.  \n \nPer the requirements of Section 329.09(a) of City Code:\n(1) The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested. \n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A \n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: Any lapse in this contract would cause an interruption of this service which is needed for the Department of Technology. Pricing and terms have not changed on the contract.\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: The pricing has not changed. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contract.  The Department of Technology must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation to be considered an emergency because the current contract expires October 31, 2025, and it is in the best interest of the City to modify and extend the contract to ensure the availability of the goods/services. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Voice, Video, and Data, Cabling Hardware, and Services with E2 Optics LLC; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Voice, Video, and Data, Cabling Hardware, and Services for use by the Department of Technology; and  \n \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing Universal Term Contract with E2 Optics, to ensure voice, video, data, cabling hardware, and services are available to maintain, relocate and repair interior network cabling; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract with E2 Optics LLC for the option to purchase Voice, Video, and Data, Cabling Hardware, and Services so that such services may continue uninterrupted as the current contract expires on October 31, 2025, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore: \n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contract with E2 Optics LLC, PO295133 for a period of (1) one year, from November 1, 2025 to and including October 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
