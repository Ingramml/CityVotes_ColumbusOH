    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) is accepting Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) SFY 2027 applications for the Local Transportation Improvement Program (LTIP) and State Capital Improvement Program (SCIP).  MORPC serves in a staff support capacity to the District Three (Franklin County) Public Works Integrating Committee (PWIC).\n \nOPWC requires that a designated official be authorized to submit said applications and execute project agreements for approved projects.  Additionally, OPWC is required to award a minimum of 10% of the SCIP funding as a no interest loan; in order to make City applications more favorable, some of the applications may include a request for a no interest loan.  Therefore, the applications and ensuing agreements may also require a signature from the Director of Finance and Management and City Auditor, as appropriate, to sign for funding use certification, local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to submit applications and to execute project agreements for approved projects.  The legislation will also authorize the Director of Finance and Management and City Auditor, as appropriate, to sign for funding use certification, local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service plans to submit applications for the following projects:\n \n530086-100037 Intersection Improvements - Refugee at Hines.  This project will install a new railroad coordinated mast arm traffic signal system at the intersection of Refugee Road and Hines Road. The west and north approaches to the intersection will be widened to include turn lanes. Refugee Road will be widened west of the intersection to provide an eastbound left turn lane. The final section of Refugee Road west of the intersection will include three lanes (eastbound through, eastbound left turn, and westbound through). Hines Road will be widened north of the intersection to provide a southbound right turn lane. The final section of Hines Road north of the intersection will include three lanes (southbound right turn, southbound left turn, northbound through). Striping on Refugee Road east of the intersection will be adjusted to accommodate the new eastbound left turn lane. Additionally, sidewalk will be added on the north side of Refugee Road and west side of Hines Road, shared use path will be added on the south side of Refugee Road, the at-grade railroad crossing will be replaced, a pedestrian crossing of the railroad will be added, the railroad crossing warning devices will be replaced, street lighting will be installed, fiber optic interconnect will be installed along Refugee Road from Gender Road to Hines Road, and grading and storm sewer improvements will be installed as needed.  Total project cost is approximately $4,812,710.00.\n \n530161-100185 Roadway Improvements - Sancus Blvd Widening.  This project provides significant safety and congestion reduction improvements along Sancus Boulevard from Worthington Woods Boulevard to Lazelle Road. Improvements include pavement widening to add a center turn lane where necessary, pavement rehabilitation, shared use path, sidewalk, traffic signal replacements, and street lighting. Improvements will also be installed along Worthington Woods Boulevard and Park Road west and east of Sancus Boulevard, including adding turn lanes at their respective intersections with Sancus Boulevard and multi-modal improvements.  Total project cost is approximately $13,131,168.00.\n \n531079-100000 Roadway - Livingston Ave - 18th St to Nelson Rd.  This project consists of infrastructure improvements on Livingston Avenue from 18th Street to Nelson Road. The corridor will be reconfigured from a 4-lane section to a 3-lane section to enhance pedestrian, bicyclists, and motorist safety. Improvements include: complete reconstruction of the roadway, curb replacement - including curb extensions at Ohio Ave Champion Ave, and Kelton Ave, improvements to the storm drainage system, raised bike lanes, sidewalks, medians, street lighting, 16” water line replacement. Traffic signals will be replaced at 7 intersections at Ohio Ave, Champion Ave, Lockbourne Rd, Miller Ave, Kelton Ave, Fairwood Ave, and Nelson Rd. A pedestrian hybrid beacon (PHB) will be replaced at Carpenter St. Rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFB) will be installed for crossing Livingston Avenue at 22nd St, Wilson Ave, Lilley Ave, and Rhoads Ave. The north and south legs of Fairwood Ave will each be realigned to improve safety and efficiency at the intersection. To facilitate these improvements, the project also includes the relocation/replacement/ improvements of the utility poles, two City of Columbus (CoC) power circuits, CoC fiber optic facilities, signal interconnect, CoC Police safety cameras, and joint users currently on the existing utility poles.  Total project cost is approximately $40,929,052.00.\n \n(This listing is meant to be illustrative and is believed to be accurate and complete; however, last minute project additions and substitutions are permitted at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.)\n \n 3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nApproval of this legislation will provide an opportunity to secure funds for various projects.  The preliminary allocation for the District Three Public Works Integrating Committee is approximately $38,000,000, and it is to be awarded in the form of grants and loans.  As a part of the application for grant funds, the City may apply for a maximum of $3,000,000 in loans as necessary to make the applications more favorable to OPWC and the City.\n \nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to submit applications for the Local Transportation Improvement Program and State Capital Improvement Program and to execute project agreements for approved projects; to authorize the Director of Public Service and the Director of Finance and Management to submit loan documents and borrow money from the Ohio Public Works Commission for projects as awarded under the State Capital Improvement Program; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management and City Auditor, as appropriate, to sign for funding use certification, local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment.
