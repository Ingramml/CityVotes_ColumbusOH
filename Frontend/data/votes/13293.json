    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with The EDGE Group, Inc. for the Mason Run Park Development Project. The contract amount is $354,090.00, with a contingency of $69,000.00, for a total of $423,090.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nAcquired by Columbus Recreation and Parks in 2022, Mason Run Park is a 78-acre conservation area and future community park. It is one of the last undeveloped woodlands in the Mid East Community. This park will provide safe and accessible youth sports programming and active park amenities. These amenities will consist of multipurpose sports fields, hard courts, play spaces, and fitness spaces. Amenities will also include restored natural areas, creating a series of paths and trails through the woodlands. These paths and trails will provide both passive recreation within the park and improved community connectivity from Kimberly Parkway to Hamilton Road and the Eastland Mall Property. Parking will also be provided. Once the design is complete, Recreation and Parks anticipates bidding construction in the fourth quarter of 2026 and completing construction in winter 2027-2028.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status): Bids were advertised through Vendor Services and Bonfire, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 17, 2025, and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 7, 2025.
