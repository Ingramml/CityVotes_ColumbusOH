    "description": "EXPLANATION\n \nBACKGROUND: The City is currently involved in the North Market Development Project (“Public Project”).  As surveys were completed for the Public Project, it was discovered that the City was not the titled owner of a small portion of Vine Street.  This portion is, and has been for many years, City right-of-way.  The City’s Department of Public Service (“DPS”) reviewed the title report and, in an effort to clear title to this right of way, requested that the City Attorney acquire the approximate 0.154 acre parcel that is a portion of Vine Street between Park Street and Wall Street (“Real Estate”). Accordingly, the City intends to appropriate and accept the Real Estate in the event the City Attorney is unable to (i) locate the owners of the Real Estate, or (ii) agree with the owners of the Real Estate in good faith regarding the amount of just compensation. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: Not applicable.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable. \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Emergency action is requested in order to acquire the Real Estate and allow the Department of Public Service to continue to maintain and operate this right of way without unnecessary delay, which will preserve the public peace, health, property, safety, and welfare.\n \nTITLE\n \nTo declare the City’s necessity and intent to appropriate and accept certain fee simple title and lesser real estate in order to clear title to a portion of Vine Street right of way; and to declare an emergency.
