    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing contract with i3 Milestone, LLC to provide Co-browsing service licenses for the Customer Self-Service Portal Solution and Implementation services. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $45,000.00.\n \nThe i3 Milestone ePortal has been selected as part of the customer cloud service and Integrated Systems Upgrade Project. This portal is a new self-service software solution that will help support the Department of Public Utilities and its customers. i3 Milestone, LLC. is the sole developer of the software and will provide all licenses and support. Services under the original contract, authorized by Ord. 0497-2025, cover a one (1) year period from date of execution to and including March 31, 2026, with the option to renew annually for the duration of the software usage, on a year-to-year basis, or a portion thereof, based on mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds and approval of Columbus City Council. \n \nThe i3 Milestone ePortal is a new software solution that will support the Department of Public Utilities and its customers. It will be fully integrated with the Oracle customer cloud service, the interactive voice response system, and the Department’s bill print vendors. It will provide customers with various functionalities including the ability to retrieve historic bills, view and export usage data, and project rate increase and forecasted usage impacts on their budget. It will also provide our customers with easy navigation and the ability to update their account including paperless billing, billing alerts, and methods of communication. The new portal can be accessed to pay customers bills electronically via a desktop or mobile device. \n \nThe ePortal provides the City with a reduced call volume due to the self-service functions, allowing the Department’s Customer Service and Billing sections to operate more efficiently. Some of the calls that are expected to be minimized involve questions regarding special payment arrangements, customer moves, outage reporting, an agent chat, ability to complete online applications for discounts, and schedule appointments. \n \nPortal supports co-browse functionality through eAdmin, allowing CSRs to view customer accounts remotely. This feature is extremely useful if City of Columbus' customers’ needs assistance. It shows the CSR what customers are seeing on their screen and allows CSRs to point out how to navigate ePortal in real-time. Every click on the screen by CSRs can be viewed on the customers screen and vice versa. Through eAdmin, CSRs can also use a \"portal view” of a customer's account, where they would see a view-only version of the portal. \n \nThe co-browsing functionality is supported through the eAdmin, allowing customer service representatives to view customer accounts remotely. This co-browsing license will allow the customer service representative to see what customers are seeing on their screen and allows them to clearly help the customer navigate the ePortal in real time. This feature is useful if City of Columbus' residents require assistance. \n \nThe addition of the co-browsing service license term will be from contract execution to and including March 31, 2026. At that time, the co-browsing renewal will be apart of the regular software licenses and implementation services renewal. This contract shall not automatically renew. All other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.      \n \nProcurement:  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive proposals through Vendor Services and Bonfire from September 27th, 2024 to October 18th, 2024 for the Customer Self-Service Portal Solution and Implementation in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code, RFQ028837. Four (4) bids were received by 360S2G, i3 Milestone, LLC., J.P. Morgan, and VertexOne. They were all deemed responsive and were evaluated on October 18th, 2024. The evaluation committee determined that i3 Milestone, LLC. submitted the strongest proposal because of the relevant experience of its project team, its understanding of the Department’s scope of work, its understanding of the requirements of the remote desktop protocols, and presented a tailored approach to address those needs.  \n \nThe term of the contract will be for one-year with annual renewals for the duration of the software usage. For each year of the contract, funding is contingent on funding availability, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of City Council, and certification of funds by the City Auditor. \n \nOrdinance 0497-2025 authorized the initial term of the contract and was submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification is $45,000.00.  Total contract amount including this renewal is $265,000.00.\n \n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  Additional co-browsing service license is now required for the i3 Customer Self-Service Portal.\n \n3.
