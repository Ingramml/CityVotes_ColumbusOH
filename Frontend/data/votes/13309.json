    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: By Ordinance 3144-2018, Columbus City Council authorized the transfer to two properties held in the Land Reutilization Program to the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation (COCIC).  The properties were originally acquired by the City as a part of the implementation of the East Franklinton Creative Community Plan and were made available by COCIC to lease to small businesses engaged in art-related businesses.  With this legislation, the properties will be transferred back into City ownership and leased to the Franklinton Arts District (FAD), an Ohio nonprofit corporation.  FAD is a local arts organization who will occupy a portion of one of the buildings and continue sublease agreements with the existing tenants.  The agreement will require the establishment of ongoing building reserves from the income derived from the subleasing.   \n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to accept deeds for real properties located at 503 W.
