    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Smoot Construction Company of Ohio to provide construction services associated with the Hoover Amenities Project. The modification amount is $1,592,754.93, with a contingency of $545,000.00, for a total of $2,137,754.93 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Hoover Amenities project is located at two distinct locations around Hoover Reservoir. The boat launch ramp can be found near the intersection of Sunbury Road and Walnut Street at 7940 South Sunbury Road in Westerville. The Mudflats Boardwalk is located at the north end of the reservoir and is located near the intersection of Columbus Street and Front Street in Galena. The boat launch ramp is an existing feature that will require demolition and removal. The boardwalk was demolished last year during the low water level season.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department is receiving a grant of $1,500,000.00 from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources that will go toward the boat ramp removal and reconstruction. The Columbus Department of Water and Power is contributing up to $950,000.00 in funds for shoreline stabilization and parking lot repaving at the boat ramp. The Recreation and Parks Department is delivering this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) format and this modification will allow progress to the next phase of this project. \n \nThe original completion date of the project was April 17, 2025. The modified project completion date, as a result of the proposed modification, is June 13, 2026.  \n \nAmount of Additional Funds: $2,137,54.93\n \nWhy Additional Services Were Not Foreseen: This modification was foreseen due to the nature of Construction Manager at Risk contracts. This modification covers the scope for construction of the project.\n \nWhy It Is Not In The Best Interest For The City To Award Additional Services Through Another Procurement Process: All of the scope associated with this vendor's contract modification was planned as part of the original project scope. The project was broken into phases and contract modifications to align with the Construction Manager at Risk project delivery method.\n \nHow The Price For The Additional Services Was Determined: The price for additional services was determined by the vendor providing anticipated construction costs for the construction team.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nSmoot Construction Company of Ohio\n1907 Leonard Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio 43219\nGreg Palmer, (614) 253-9000                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 004871\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 6, 2026\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that work can be completed during the low water season of September 2025 through April 2026.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The reservoirs provide countless recreational opportunities to several hundred thousand Columbus residents per year for activities that include birding, hiking, boating, kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and more.  The three amenities included in this project will provide additional opportunities to experience the reservoir and will also promote improved participant accessibility.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Multiple concerned citizens have reached out to the Accessibility Office for the City of Columbus.  Their complaint was that Recreation and Parks does not allow fishing from any of the dock walkways due to accessibility issues for those individuals utilizing the boat ramps and marinas for boating.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by making needed upgrades to infrastructure.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $3,000,000.00 was legislated for the Hoover Amenities Project by Ordinance 0722-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $2,137,754.93. $2,137,754.93 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 and Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $5,137,754.93. Funds are appropriated and available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, for this expenditure. An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project. A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Smoot Construction Company of Ohio for the Hoover Amenities Project; to authorize an amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $2,137,754.93 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund and the Water Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
