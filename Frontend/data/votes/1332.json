    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and provide funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) relative to the Safety Upgrades - Hamilton Rd. Safety Improvements project, also known as FRA-70-21.33, PID 109014. \nAdministered by ODOT, the aforementioned project, which currently is in development, encompasses safety upgrades at the interchange of I-70 and Hamilton Road. Planned improvements include: widening the Hamilton Road ramp to I-70 eastbound to two lanes; realigning the I-70 east entrance and exit ramps at the SR 317/Hamilton Road intersection; removing the I-70 east to SR 317 NB connector and the connector to Hilton Corporate Drive; and upgrading the traffic signal at that location. \nODOT recently agreed, at the behest of the Department of Public Service, to install additional interconnect conduits within the project limits, necessitating design revisions that will be incorporated into the Stage 3 plans for the project. The cost of the additional design and engineering services is presently estimated to be $34,000.00.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $34,000.00 is available within the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund within the Department of Public Service to support the local share of estimated design costs. \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of requisite agreements with ODOT as soon as reasonably practicable in order to maintain the project schedule established by ODOT and to promote highway safety. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and provide funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Safety Upgrades - Hamilton Rd.
