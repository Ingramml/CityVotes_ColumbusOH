    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract with UKG Kronos Systems LLC to continue TeleStaff automated staffing (UKG TeleStaff Cloud) subscription services.  This service and support covers software from UKG Kronos Systems LLC, a web-based software solution designed specifically to help the Division of Fire manage its complex staffing assignments.  This indispensable staffing solution has been utilized by the Division of Fire since 2006.  A bid waiver is necessary as UKG Kronos Systems LLC is the proprietary owner of its contents, and thus no other vendor can offer these services; the Division of Fire is not currently seeking a replacement to this highly customized software.\n \nThe term of this contract is for three (3) years with the option of two (2) additional one (1) year renewal terms and subsequent one (1) year annual renewals thereafter by mutual agreement and approval by City Council.  The cost for each of the first five (5) years has been negotiated and fixed as $172,800.00 for Year 1 with a 4% year-over-year increase for the initial five (5) year term.  Funding for this contract will be encumbered on a year-to-year basis contingent upon the appropriation of City Council and certification of funds by the City Auditor.  \nContract Compliance: UKG Kronos Systems LLC, Fed Tax ID: 04-2640942, Vendor # 000190\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to guarantee uninterrupted subscription software and website support services since the current contract expires on December 31, 2025 and the service transition for the product at issue already has a three (3) month delay.\n \nBid Waiver Justification:  The Division of Fire has successfully implemented this specialized fire staffing software with UKG Kronos Systems LLC, the proprietary owner of its contents, and is not seeking replacement to this highly customized software.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $172,800.00 from the 2025 General Fund Operating Budget for UKG TeleStaff Cloud service and support with UKG Kronos Systems LLC.  For these services, the Division of Fire has spent $159,974.50 so far in 2025, $153,840.00 in 2024, and $136,638.74 in 2023. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a contract with UKG Kronos Systems LLC, for the Division of Fire, for UKG TeleStaff Cloud subscription services; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the contract as multi-year and renewable; to authorize the expenditure of $172,800.00 for Year 1 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
