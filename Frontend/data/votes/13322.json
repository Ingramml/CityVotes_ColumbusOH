    "description": "Explanation \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing contract with Woolpert, Inc. for Geographic Information System (GIS) professional services. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $150,000.00. The original contract was authorized by Ordinance 2574-2024.\nThis legislation allows the consultant to help with continued development of the City of Columbus’ GIS system, including its associated applications and datasets. Specific tasks include migrating legacy scripts to Python 3; migrating ArcGIS Desktop 10.x Data Reviewer rule set to ArcGIS Pro 3.x; support for the Climate Action Plan and Sustainability Team; web mapping and application creation and support; second tier support for the Hydrant Web, Water Valve, and Watershed Management applications; and other task-based on-site staff support. \nThe original contract associated with PO415023 for Geographic Information System (GIS) professional services expired on October 06, 2024, leaving $150,000.00 remaining. Ordinance 2574-2025 authorized a new contract for GIS professional services and approved the use of the funds available on PO415023 through the expiration of the new contract, November 30th, 2025. The term of the contract was established for one-year with two one-year renewal options. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be required.\nThis ordinance authorizes the first one-year renewal option. For each year of the contract, funding is contingent on availability within the budget, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of City Council, and certification of funds by the City Auditor. \n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal No. 2 is $150,000.00.  Total contract amount including this renewal is $300,000.00.\n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known at the time of the initial contract and this legislation authorizes funding to cover a continuation of the consultant’s work for an additional year.\n3. Reason other procurement processes were not used: Work under this renewal No. 1 is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract.  No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated currently.\n4. How was cost determined: The renewal is based on rates that were negotiated and established in the existing contract.\nPrincipal Parties: \nWoolpert, Inc.\n1 Easton Oval, Suite 400\nColumbus, Ohio 43219       \nBrian Stevens, (614) 476-6000                                         \nContract Compliance Number: 001040\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: 04/03/2027\nSubcontractor: \nCAD Concepts, Inc.
