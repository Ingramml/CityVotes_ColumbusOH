    "description": "Title\n \nTo Honor And Recognize Equality Ohio for 20 Years of Advocacy on Behalf of LGBTQ+ Lived and Legal Equality\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Equality Ohio was founded in 2005 by a group of 65 dedicated LGBTQ+ activists and allies from all corners of Ohio after voters passed a constitutional amendment prohibiting same sex marriage and civil unions, and in the 20 years since, Equality Ohio has provided vital and life-saving advocacy and services to Ohio’s LGBTQ+ community; and\n \n \nWHEREAS, In 2019, after a year of research examining community lawyering best practices around the United States and an assessment of over 2,000 community surveys, Equality Ohio established the only entity in Ohio providing culturally humble and sensitive general legal assistance to support a growing need within the LGBTQ+ community; and\n \n \nWHEREAS, Ohio still does not provide even basic nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ Ohioans in housing, employment, or public accommodations, yet Equality Ohio has aided 37 Ohio locales in the passage of a Non-Discrimination Ordinance and 14 Ohio locales in the passage of a “Conversion Therapy” Ban; and \n \n \nWHEREAS, The historic Equality Ohio Legal Clinic has served over 4,000 Ohioans since 2019, becoming the statewide experts on LGBTQ+ specific legal concerns and is one of only two legal clinics of its kind in the country, and\n \n \nWHEREAS, Equality Ohio’s services are required now more than ever as transphobia, homophobia, and queerphobia are growing exponentially in the United States, leading to violence, discrimination, and legislation that impacts LGBTQ+ Ohioans' concrete health outcomes and life expectancy; now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council hereby honors and recognizes Equality Ohio for the organization’s 20 years of advocacy on behalf of Ohio’s LGBTQ+ community.",
