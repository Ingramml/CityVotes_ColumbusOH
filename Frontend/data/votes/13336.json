    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to make payment to OST Inc. of the District of Columbia (OST Inc.), for services rendered, and to declare an emergency in the amount of $642,173.10.\n \nThese professional services support DoT’s operational needs and have played a critical role in the initial phases of the Zero Trust Network (ZTN) initiative, aiding the department in the transformation of the city’s network systems to enhance cybersecurity, asset management, and network efficiency across over 250 city locations.\n \nThe invoices incurred under an existing agreement with OST Inc. of the District of Columbia (OST Inc.), reflected rates above those set forth in the original rate card. This resulted in a discrepancy between encumbering documents and invoices.  Such invoices have been reviewed, and are determined by the Director to be reasonable, necessary, and related to the services performed within the scope of the agreement. \n \nThe total amount accounts for $302,658.45 in pending invoices. The amount of $339,514.65 has been paid in prior disbursements for services rendered under the agreement. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT \nThe amount of $339,514.65 has been paid in prior disbursements for services rendered under the agreement.\n \nFunding in the amount of $302,658.45 is available and appropriated for the payment of this expenditure on PO452697 (extended by Ord. 2984-2024) and PO485122 within the Department of Technology, as noted in the attached “Then and Now Certificate” approved by the City Auditor.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation to promptly pay the vendor for services rendered, and to ensure that there is no interruption in critical city operations including email, authentication services, VoIP, business system analysts, program management, operating systems, GIS, boundary networking, storage, databases, and the ZTN initiative.  \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: OST Inc. of the District of Columbia\nVendor Acct #: 042892\nExpiration Date: 8/6/2026\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to authorize payment to OST Inc. of the District of Columbia per the invoice approved by the Department Director (or designee) in an amount not to exceed $642,173.10 from established purchase orders; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, OST Inc., provided cybersecurity, asset management, and network productivity services to the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, after these services were rendered, the City received an invoice for which a purchase order, with a prior certification of availability of funds by the City Auditor attached, had been obtained, however the prices invoiced did not correspond with the price list; and\n \nWHEREAS, Section 5705.41 (D)(1) of the Ohio Revised Code provides that in certain circumstances a political subdivision may authorize payment on a contract executed without prior certification by the City Auditor; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Council now has before it a certificate from the City Auditor certifying there was at the time of making the contract and at the time of the execution of such certificate a sufficient sum appropriated for the purpose of such contract and in the treasury or in process of collection to the credit of an appropriate fund free from any encumbrances (a “then and now certificate”); and\n \nWHEREAS, less than thirty days have passed since the City Council’s receipt of the certificate from the City Auditor; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Council desires to satisfy the obligations of the contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the daily operations of Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to present this ordinance for the City Auditor to issue a warrant in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code Section 5705.41 (D)(1) and pay outstanding invoices, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.   That City Council hereby acknowledges receipt of the “then and now certificate” from the City Auditor and authorizes and directs the City Auditor to authorize payment to OST Inc. of the District of Columbia per the invoice approved by the Department Director (or designee) in an amount not to exceed $642,173.10 to OST Inc. of the District of Columbia, of which $339,514.65 has been paid on existing purchase orders and $302,658.45 will paid using established PO452697 and PO485122.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approved by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
