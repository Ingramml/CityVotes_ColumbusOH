    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance repeals Ordinance 2135-2025, passed by City Council on July 28, 2025. The grant agreement authorized under said ordinance has not been executed, and since the passage of the ordinance, the desired grant amount has changed. In addition to the repeal, this ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University in support of the Opportunity Port program operated by the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center.\n \nThe Drug Enforcement and Policy Center promotes and supports interdisciplinary, evidence-based research, education on illicit drugs and marijuana, and provide record relief services through two service engagement projects, Opportunity Port (sealing and expungement) and the Ohio Governor Expedited Pardon Project (clemency).\n \nOpportunity Port's mission is to make sealing/expungement application assistance more consistently available and more accessible through mobile-friendly, remote-based services. \n \nOpportunity Port expanded services statewide in January 2024, enabling its service providers to prepare (but not file) applications to seal/expunge criminal matters outside of Franklin County. Given this, Franklin County residents can therefore be provided with more comprehensive legal assistance through Opportunity Port.\n \nThe funding being requested from Council will support Franklin County operations only.\n \nEmergency Designation: This legislation seeks to declare an emergency to ensure that there are no gaps or delays in the provision of record-sealing services given the delay in the execution of the grant agreement and to ensure that the services continue to be provided to the community without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University in support of the Opportunity Port program operated by the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center; to authorize the reimbursement of expenses prior to the issuance of a purchase order; and to authorize an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to repeal Ordinance 2135-2025; and to declare an emergency. ($55,500.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the existence of criminal records hinders the equitable growth and success of Columbus as a whole; and\n \nWHEREAS, one in three American adults has a criminal record that will appear on a routine background check, the effect of which disproportionately impacts people of color and lower-income individuals; and\n \nWHEREAS, according to a University of Michigan study, record sealing has been shown to increase an individual’s earnings by 25% along with other positive impacts; and\n \nWHEREAS, Opportunity Port is an online tool that connects justice-involved persons with limited-scope legal service providers who assist with the record sealing and expungement application process; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to repeal Ordinance 2135-2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University in support of the Opportunity Port program to ensure that there are no gaps or delays in the provision of record-sealing services for the community, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That Ordinance 2135-2025, passed by City Council on July 28, 2025, authorizing a grant agreement of $47,500.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University in support of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center (DEPC) and the Center’s Opportunity Port program, in an amount not to exceed $55,500.00.\n \nSECTION 3. That the expenditure of $55,500.00 or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 2 of this ordinance, is hereby authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That expenses incurred prior to the issuance of a purchase order, from and after January 1, 2025 may be reimbursed.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
