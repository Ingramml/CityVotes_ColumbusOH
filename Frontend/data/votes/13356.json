    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded the Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Use Site-based Program Grant extension from the Bureau of Justice Assistance through the Board of Commissioners of Franklin County, Ohio, on behalf of Franklin County’s Office of Justice Policy and Programs (hereinafter the “County”), for the Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Division. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate up to $288,717.00 and any additional funds in grant money for the period of October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026. \n \nThe purpose of this funding is to increase access to harm reduction supplies for existing harm reduction vending machines in the community. These free supplies (naloxone, fentanyl test strips, condoms and pregnancy tests) will provide community members with items to prevent overdose, as well as decrease the spread of communicable disease.  Additionally, a part time Health Education Program Planner will be hired to expand outreach and engagement by educating community members on harm reduction strategies and how to access and use the vending machine supplies. This staff person will also monitor the machines and supplies, and collect data to report on the utilization of the machines.  \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency as the grant extension period began October 1, 2025 and as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible to expend the awarded funds and achieve the grant outcomes within the timeframe and deadlines of the grant.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Use Site-based Program Grant extension is fully funded by the Bureau of Justice Assistance through the County and does not require a City match. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to accept a grant from Bureau of Justice Assistance through the County in the amount of up to $288,717.00 and any additional funds;
