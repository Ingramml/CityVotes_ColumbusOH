    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Minsait ACS, Inc. for hardware, software, and project services related to the PRISM Historian hardware Server and eAlarm application. \n \nMinsait ACS, Inc. is the original developer and system architect for the Division of Power’s existing PRISM SCADA system. PRISM historian and eAlarm are add-ons to this existing system. PRISM historian extends the number of collected points beyond the 14,000 limit of PRISM HDC, supports data collection intervals down to one second, allows reporting through traditional Greport tool and LibreOffice macros, and supports high-availability database configurations. The eAlarm event application provides the capability for email alerts for system events or critical alarms for up to 20 recipients. Due to the custom solution used by the Division of Power, it is in the City’s best interest to enter into a sole-source contract for these two package add-ons.\n \nThe original PRISM system was upgraded under the authorization of ORD #2409-2022. This project is estimated to take three months from project kickoff, but as delays are possible, the contract will extend from date of execution through completion of the historical data transfer, and end with shipment of the system and acceptance by the Division of Power.\n \nVendor: \nMinsait ACS, Inc.                                                  \nContract Compliance Number: 008779\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: 7/8/2022 (pending update)\n \nFiscal Impact: $106,045 is budgeted and available from within the Public Utilities Electricity Operating Fund to meet the financial obligations of this contract.
