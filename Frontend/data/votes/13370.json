    "description": "Explanation \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing agreement with Irvin Public Relations, LLC. for Communications Support services. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $87,500.00. The original contract was authorized by Ordinance 3199-2024.\nThe Sustainable Columbus office works to reduce climate change impact in our community to protect the environment and improve the quality of life for today’s residents and for future generations. The office shapes policy, creates actionable programming to improve the city’s environment, and gives residents the tools to incorporate sustainability into their everyday lives. The work is guided by the Columbus Climate Action Plan, which commits the Columbus community to carbon neutrality by 2050 and a 45% reduction in emissions while imparting equity and improving quality of life for our most climate vulnerable residents. \nThe professional communications and marketing services vendor will continue assisting with earned media, digital media, social media, engagement opportunities, and events that will employ behavior change marketing strategies. The communication support will continue to increase visibility and provide an understanding of Sustainable Columbus, its programs, resources, and assist in connecting residents to climate solutions while creating social norms around climate action in Columbus.\nOrdinance 3199-2024 authorized the initial contract, with the option to renew annually for two (2) additional one (1) year periods upon mutual agreement between the parties, availability of budgeted funds, and approval by City Council. This ordinance authorizes the first one-year renewal option. This first year renewal will be in effect from January 1, 2026 up to and including December 31, 2026.\nFor each year of the contract, funding is contingent on availability within the budget, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of City Council, and certification of funds by the City Auditor. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.\nProcurement: \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive proposals through Vendor Services and Bonfire from October 4, 2024 to November 1, 2024 for strategic communication services in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code, RFQ028883. Seven proposals were received and were all deemed responsive and were evaluated on November 13, 2024. The evaluation committee determined that Irvin Public Relations, LLC. submitted the strongest proposal because of the relevant experience of its project team, its understanding of the Department’s needs, and presented a tailored approach to address those needs.\nThe term of the original contract was for one-year with two one-year renewal options. For each year of the contract, funding is contingent on funding availability, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of City Council, and certification of funds by the City Auditor. \nThis ordinance authorizes the first renewal option for the second year of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal No. 1 is $87,500.00.  Total contract amount including this renewal is $187,500.00.\n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known at the time of the initial contract and this legislation authorizes funding to cover a continuation of the consultant’s work for an additional year.\n3. Reason other procurement processes were not used: Work under this renewal No. 1 is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract.  No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated currently.\n4. How was cost determined: The renewal is based on rates that were negotiated and established in the existing contract.\nPrincipal Parties: \nIrvin Public Relations, LLC\n61 Jefferson Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                        \nSarah Irvin Clark, 614-225-9100\nContract Compliance Number: 002045\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: August 25, 2027  \nFiscal Impact: $87,500.00 is budgeted and available from within the Electricity Operating Fund to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n$59,700.00 has been spent so far in 2025\n$00.00 was spent in 2024\n$00.00 was spent in 2023\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract renewal with Irvin Public Relations, LLC for Communications Support services; and to authorize the expenditure of $87,500.00 from the Electricity Operating Fund.
