    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, dba GPD Group, Inc., for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project, CIP #670868-100001, in an amount not to exceed $200,000.00. \n \nThe Division of Power requires professional engineering services to assist Division personnel on a myriad of issues which cannot be provided exclusively by City personnel. Services to be performed under this contract include providing designs to connect new customers, reviewing applications for Joint Use, and designing the work required for the Division to complete in conjunction with the installation of solar on the system by NextEra. Other work that may be performed on this or subsequent renewals of this General Engineering Services contract include, but may not be limited to, Substation Design, Transmission Line Design, Distribution Line Design, Underground Distribution Design, Equipment Upgrade Program, Grounding Studies, SCADA, Streetlight Design, Power Quality Issues, Development of Bid Packages, Bid Analysis/Technical Reviews, Technical Submittal and request for Information Reviews, Easement Acquisition Services, AutoCAD Drafting, Surveying, Easement Legal Descriptions, Trouble Shooting, Maintenance and Testing Specifications, and Fiber Optic Cable System Design. \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide. \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $200,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract                                                        $  750,000.00 (ORD 1369-2022; PO328687)\nRenewal #1                                                                $  375,000.00 (ORD 1250-2023; PO390890)\nModification #1                                                           $  750,000.00 (ORD 2864-2023; PO430004)\nModification #2 (current)                                             $      200,000 (current)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                $ 2,075,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nGPD Group has been providing these services under a contract awarded through the City’s RFP process and with planned modifications/renewals to add funding for future years.  Rebidding the contract and using another company would be more expensive as the new company would need to spend time learning and redoing work already performed by GPD Group.\n \n1.3. How the cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis is a contract for needed supplemental engineering for the Division of Power’s various CIP projects, studies required by OSHA and PERRP i.e. Arc Flash Hazard Analysis, and possibly to reduce backlog of DOP’s routine engineering that may arise from unexpected work force reduction and/or greater than normal  workload volume.  As such, it will not have any economic impact, but it will include community outreach if it is used for projects that typically solicit input from the community.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nGPD Group’s contract compliance number is CC-006560 and expires 6/23/2027.  GPD Group’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.  \n \nThe subcontractor GPD Group proposes to use for this contract modification is listed below:\nCompany Name                                                        City/State                               ODI Certification Status\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants (AEC)                         Columbus, OH                                                                       MBE\n \nThe certification of GPD Group and AEC were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.  The Division of Power is anticipating a 2-month gap in funds between the last modification and the new general engineering services contract being in place. DOP is very shorthanded with engineering staff and needs to utilize this contract for technical support. A lot of work has been put on hold with GPD that we must restart to avoid delaying public and private utility projects including ODOT 70/71 and small cell tower projects.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT  \nFunds are appropriated and available within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, dba GPD Group, Inc., for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; to authorize an amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Electricity Bond Fund; to expend up to $200,000.00 from the Electricity Bond Fund for the project and to declare an emergency.  ($200,000.00)  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; and \n \nWHEREAS, Contract PO328387 was authorized by Ordinance 1369-2022 for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract modification with GPD is needed to provide funding for the upgrade work that will be performed this year; and\n \nWHEREAS,  it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvements Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient budget authority for the proper project; and \n \nWHEREAS, a transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for the contract modification; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities in that it is immediately necessary to execute the contract modification to avoid delaying public and private utility projects including ODOT 70/71 and small cell tower projects, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore,\n  \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change \n6303 / 670870-100000 / General Engineering Services - Power (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $196,852.00 $0.00 / ($196,852.00)\n6303 / 670774-100000 / Conversion to 3 Wire (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $10,247.00 / $7,101.00 / ($3,146.00)\n \n6303 / 670868-100001 / Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $0.00 / $200,000.00 / $200,000.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That a transfer of funds between projects within the Electricity Bond, Fund 6303, is authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.
