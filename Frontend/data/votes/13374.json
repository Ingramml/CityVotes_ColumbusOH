    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify an existing service agreement for the Columbus MSA Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) Engagement and Plan Development with Planning Communities, LLC to add additional funding. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $15,000.00. \nThe grant acceptance was authorized by ordinance 2503-2023 and the original contract with Planning Communities, LLC for the grant related work was authorized by Ordinance 0001-2024.\nThe contractor began work in 2023 and has been engaged in ongoing drafting and review of materials. The current phase, Drafts for Review, will continue through September 30, 2025. Following this, the contractor will shift to the Production of the Final Central Ohio Climate Action Plan Document, which will run through the project’s completion. During this production phase, a Public Meeting is expected to be held to gather feedback and support finalization of the document. The contract is projected to conclude no later than December 1, 2025, in alignment with the EPA’s required submission deadline.\n \nThis project advances multiple priorities for the City of Columbus and Central Ohio by strengthening environmental sustainability, economic resilience, and equities across the region. The Central Ohio Climate Action Plan will provide a coordinated pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while supporting workforce development, public health, and long-term cost savings for residents and businesses. By identifying strategies that lower energy use, expand clean energy, and reduce waste, the plan supports both economic competitiveness and environmental stewardship.\n \nEnvironmental advantages of the project include improving air quality, reducing harmful emissions, and promoting healthier communities through cleaner transportation, energy, and land use practices. Economic advantages include creating new opportunities in clean energy, construction, and sustainable infrastructure, as well as reducing long-term costs for households and businesses through greater efficiency and resilience. Taken together, the CCAP will position Central Ohio as a leader in equitable, sustainable growth while ensuring the region is prepared to meet federal climate targets and protect quality of life for future generations.\n \nThe work under this modification includes a deliverable for the Columbus Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) Workforce Planning Analysis (WPA). This analysis will cover the ten counties within the Columbus MSA. The primary objectives are to identify workforce gaps, devise strategies to address these gaps, and foster partnerships necessary for achieving the goals of the Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP) with emphasis on equity.
