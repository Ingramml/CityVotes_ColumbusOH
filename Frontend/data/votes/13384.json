($210,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Ordinance 2178-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on September 9, 2024, authorized the Public Safety Director to modify and extend its contract with SoundThinking Inc., formerly ShotSpotter Inc., for an additional three-year term (June 30, 2024 through June 29, 2027) for the Phase II coverage area. Ordinance 1644-2022, amended most recently by ordinance 1244-2024, passed May 20, 2024, established a three-year agreement with ShotSpotter, a subscription based service that involves the installation of a gunfire sensor network in areas identified by the City. These sensors connect to a cloud-based data center infrastructure, providing a 24/7/365 gunfire monitoring service within a twelve (12) square-mile radius of the installed sensor infrastructure.\nIn addition to gunfire detection, the SoundThinking service will notify law enforcement agencies of gunfire incidents and direct them to the precise location of gunfire. The service also offers the capability to instantly notify officers of shootings in progress with real-time data delivered to dispatch officers, patrol cars, and smart phones. The alerts are intended to improve police response to incidents of gunfire, enhance officer safety, speed aid to victims, assist in investigations and the collection of evidence, and ultimately, the apprehension of dangerous offenders. The original contract for services with SoundThinking, formerly ShotSpotter dated October 4, 2018 was established by Ordinance 2151-2018.  A modification to the contract was authorized by Ordinance 2543-2022, adopted October 3, 2022, which extended the contract term through July 2025.  As stated above, Ordinance 2178-2024 extended the term of the contract through June 29, 2027. This ordinance seeks to authorize funding for the second year of Phase II of the modified contract.\nThis ordinance is for the Phase II coverage area, which is three square miles.  Phase II will run from June 30, 2024 through June 29, 2027.  The cost will be $210,000.00 per year, which will be subject to the annual appropriation of funds by the City Auditor and approval of City Council.  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $210,000.00 for the second year of Phase II, which will run from June 30, 2025 through June 29, 2026.  The total cost of Phase II over the three year period will be $630,000.00.\nBid Waiver: Because of the established relationship with this contractor and the fact that they have technology in place at the required locations to interface with Columbus police equipment, it was not practical to bid out this service and incur start-up fees and breaks in coverage.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested in order to provide continuity to the gunfire detection program without any interruption and to pay an outstanding invoice.  \nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $210,000.00 from the General Fund with SoundThinking Inc, formerly ShotSpotter, Inc. for a gunfire location, alert, and analysis system. These funds are available within the 2025 General Fund budget. This amount represents the costs for the second year of the three-year period of Phase II.  The full cost of Phase II will be $630,000.00.  Funds will be appropriated on an annual basis.\n2024 Expenditures: $884,000.00\n2023 Expenditures: $884,000.00\nTitle\nTo authorize the expenditure of $210,000.00 from the General Fund for the second year of a three-year contract with SoundThinking Inc., formerly ShotSpotter, Inc., for use of a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis program in the Phase II coverage area; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency. ($210,000.00) \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety has determined there is a need to use the gunfire detection, alert, and analysis service provided by SoundThinking Inc. in the Phase II coverage area to assist law enforcement responding to incidents of gunfire in Columbus neighborhoods; and\nWHEREAS, this agreement covers a total radius of 3 square miles; and\nWHEREAS, a modification to the original contract was authorized by Ordinance 2178-2024, passed September 9, 2024, which extended the contract term through June 2027.\nWHEREAS, the contract is in effect for a three year period beginning June 30, 2024 and ending June 29, 2027 and will be subject to the annual appropriation of funds by the City Auditor and approval of City Council; and\nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $210,000.00 for the second year of Phase II, which will run from June 30, 2025 through June 29, 2026.  The total cost of Phase II over the three year period will be $630,000.00; and\nWHEREAS, SoundThinking can deliver instant, accurate tactical awareness to the Division of Police including precise location anywhere within the coverage area including latitude/longitude and street address, exact time and number of rounds fired and shooter position, speed and direction of travel; and\nWHEREAS, because of the established relationship with this contractor and the fact that they have technology in place at the required locations to interface with Columbus police equipment, it was not practical to bid out this service and incur start-up fees and breaks in coverage; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize appropriation of the funds needed for year two of Phase II of the gunshot detection agreement and avoid any interruption in services, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;  and NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance and to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City's financial records.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, the City Auditor shall establish such account codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That City Council finds it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding requirements under the Columbus City Codes, and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
