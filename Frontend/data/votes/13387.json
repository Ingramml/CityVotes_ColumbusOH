    "description": "Explanation \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase a contract with Azteca Systems, LLC to provide software for the Cityworks Asset Management System (AMS). The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $753,900.00.\nCityworks AMS is used as a department wide Asset Management solution and is replacing Oracle WAM. The software contract is an annual Enterprise licensing agreement that includes cloud-hosting services. The Cityworks solution modernizes our Work and Asset Management program by enabling best practices and GIS to empower DPU to better track, maintain, and manage assets across our entire organization. Cityworks provides three hosting environments, which include one each for testing, production, and development. The Department of Public Utilities (DPU) aka Columbus Water & Power (CWP) currently has 868 licenses. Additionally, the Division of Fire has 282 licenses funded by DPU and uses these licenses in collaboration with the Division of Water to support the maintenance and inspection process for Fire Hydrants across the City.\nThe initial contract term was established in accordance with the pertinent provisions to waive for competitive bidding of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code and authorized with Ord. 2517-2022. Services under the original contract covered a one (1) year period from date of execution with the option to renew annually for an additional five (5) years on a year-to-year basis, or a portion thereof, based on mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds and approval of Columbus City Council. Ord. 2833-2024 authorized the second renewal extending the contract expiration date through November 13, 2025 and adding funds for the initial 1,000 licenses through this period. Ordinance 0874-2025 authorized a modification that added 150 licenses, that were prorated from May 2025 through November 2025, each of these new Cityworks licenses prorated cost was approximately $409.38. \nThis renewal No. 3 is to provide the necessary funding for the continuation of the Cityworks Asset Management System. This proposed renewal No. 3 is for year four (4) of the contract. It will extend the contract through 11/13/2026 and add $753,900.00. The total amount including this renewal is $2,174,166.30. This contract shall not automatically renew. All other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. \nDue to a Request for Proposal (RFQ018791) that was published for the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to obtain an Asset Management System, Woolpert, Inc. was the awarded firm and the software solution they chose in the proposal was Cityworks. It has been determined that establishing one contract for services with Woolpert, Inc. and one contract for software directly with Azteca Systems, LLC (Cityworks) is the best path forward, and it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a renewal contract with Azteca Systems, LLC. \n1. Amount of additional funds: Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal No. 3 is $753,900.00.  Total contract amount including this renewal is $2,174,166.30.\n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known and provided for at the time of the initial contract award. This is a planned renewal.\n3. Reason other procurement processes were not used: Work under this renewal No. 3 is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract.  No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n4. How was cost determined: The cost, terms, and conditions are negotiated based on the number of users. The cost for this renewal was provided by a written quotation and is $753,900.00.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nAzteca Systems, LLC\n11075 South State Street, Suite 24\nSandy, UT 84070\nMichael Romano, (262) 751-6767                                         \nContract Compliance Number: 041096\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: PENDING UPDATE\n \nFiscal Impact: $753,900.00 is available from within the Public Utilities Operating Funds to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n$556,860.00 was spent in 2024\n$421,000.00 was spent in 2023\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase a contract with Azteca Systems, LLC. for software licenses associated with the Cityworks AMS system; to waive competitive bidding of the Columbus City Code; and to authorize the expenditure of $753,900.00 split between the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds.
