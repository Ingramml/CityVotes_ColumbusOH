    "description": "Title\n \nTo recognize October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month and Support Equity in Prevention, Treatment, and Survivorship. \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the average risk of a woman developing breast cancer in the United States in her lifetime is about 13%. \nWHEREAS, breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer amongst women in the United States, accounting for 30% of new female cancers each year, and remains the leading cancer diagnosis in both Ohio and Franklin County. \nWHEREAS, the breast cancer mortality rates in Franklin County and Ohio exceed the national average.  \nWHEREAS, Black women are more likely to develop breast cancer at younger ages and are disproportionately diagnosed with more aggressive forms of breast cancer compared to White women.\nWHEREAS, Black women have the highest breast cancer mortality rate at 41% and among women in Ohio, Black women have the lowest 5-year breast cancer survival rate.  \nWHEREAS, this year’s Breast Cancer Awareness Month emphasizes the urgent need to address racial disparities, calling for equitable access to cancer education, prevention and treatment for Black women who face an increased risk for breast cancer, now therefore; \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize the month of October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and does hereby recognize the numerous contributions and continued advocacy efforts by Turning the Page on Breast Cancer (TPBC), providing the comprehensive research and resources needed to promote equity, empowerment, and well-being within our community.",
