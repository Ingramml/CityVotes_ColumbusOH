    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify and increase the professional architectural / engineering services agreement, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with Karpinski Engineering, Inc., for the Department of Technology’s City Hall Structured Cabling Assessment & Design project, in the amount of $225,000.00. \n \nThis is a 2-Phased project.  Work under the Phase 1 included a comprehension assessment to upgrade/replace the aging structural wiring and cabling throughout the City Hall.  \n \nModification No. 1 (current) for Phase 2 will provide design-based services based on the results of Phase 1.\n \n2. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.  The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification:  $225,000.00  \n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $  80,381.00 (PO465203)\nModification No. 1 (current):                     $225,000.00\nTotal (Original and Mod 1):                     $305,381.00\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nThe need for Phase 2, design services, was foreseen at the time the contract was awarded with language included in Ordinance No. 1684-2024.\n \nC.  Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\nThe current contractor is familiar with the project and has completed all work to-date.  Bringing on a new contractor would further delay the project and result in higher costs bringing them up to speed.\n \nD.  How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nThe contractor submitted a cost proposal and was accepted by the Office of Construction Management.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: DAX No. 6639, expires 5/7/26, Majority-designated\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Karpinski Engineering, Inc.\n \n4.
