    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, to enter into a sole source contract with Motorola Solutions, Inc. for the ongoing maintenance and support services for the PremierOne Records system for one year, from January 1, 2026, through December 31, 2026, at a cost of $363,557.00.\n \nIn 2002, the Division of Police purchased and implemented a computerized Ohio Incident Based Reporting System/National Incident Based Reporting System (OIBRS/NIBRS), for offense and complaint/incident reports. NIBRS is a set of rules set forth by the federal government to be followed by local and state agencies when reporting crime statistics. It assures all law enforcement agencies report crime data using the same data makers, types, and descriptors, as well as the same reporting methods, which enhances the FBI's ability to analyze the incoming statistics. In 2014, the data was migrated from the legacy records management system (NetRMS) to the Motorola PremierOne Records system enabling the data to be stored within a single system.\n \nPremierOne Records is a proprietary system from Motorola Solutions, Inc., the sole provider and copyright holder. As such, the City must purchase annual support and maintenance from Motorola Solutions, Inc. For this reason, this ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the provisions of sole source procurement of the City of Columbus Code, Chapter 329.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance authorizes the continuation of maintenance and support services, from Motorola Solutions, Inc., at a cost of $363,557.00.
