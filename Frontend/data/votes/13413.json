    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\n The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority asking that the City transfer them a 19,500 square foot (0.448 acre) portion of the right-of-way near Refugee Road.  The right-of-way area is south of Refugee Road and East of Schwartz Road. The right-of-way area runs mainly east/west directionally for approximately 625+/- feet and the width is 40+/- feet, abutted to the north and by parcel 530-292866, and to the south by parcel 530-156568.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will allow the owner to incorporate it into the adjoining parcels and develop an apartment complex on the property. The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $62,000.00 was established.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on July 17, 2025.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority at the cost of $0.00 to them.\n                     \n2. FISCAL IMPACT\nThe Land Review Commission waived the cost, therefore, there is no fiscal impact to the City for transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of a 0.448 acre portion of the right-of-way near Refugee Road to Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority.
