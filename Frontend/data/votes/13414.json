Background\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from EMH&T Engineers, Surveyors, Planners, Scientists on behalf of the owner, OhioHealth Corporation, asking that the city allow encroachments into the public right-of-way. These encroachments consist of a wall shoring and drainage for the wall located along the north side of West North Broadway.

Allowing these elements will permit a parking garage to be built as part of the design. A $500.00 value for the encroachment easements were established.\n2.
