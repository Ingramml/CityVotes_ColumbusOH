    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This legislation authorizes the amendment of Ordinance No. 2395-2025, passed by Columbus City Council on Sept. 29, 2025, which authorized the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with the Columbus Museum of Art for the administration and implementation of their roof replacement project. The amount authorized in 2395-2025 was $1,000,000.00.In terms of history, the Columbus Museum of Art requested capital support from the City of Columbus in 2024 to help fund the replacement of their roof. The roof over the Columbus Museum of Art’s primary structure, which houses their art galleries, is past its useful life. Installed over 30 years ago, the roof has allowed water to seep into the Elizabeth M. and Richard M. Ross Building and has resulted in water damage to the internal decorative plaster ceiling, lighting, and floors. Further water damage may potentially impact the works of art themselves.To assist with financing the construction project, the Museum was awarded $1 million from the City of Columbus. This public financing request is in addition to financing requested by the Museum from the State of Ohio ($2 million) and the Franklin County Commissioners ($1 million). The Museum will seek private donations for any portion of the project that does not receive public financing.  An amendment is required to permit advancement of funds per a pre-determined schedule to be provided in the terms of the agreement and specify that a grant agreement shall be drafted to govern the funds.\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to prevent any project delays which could result in increased expense.\nPrincipal Party:Columbus Museum of Art\n480 East Broad StreetColumbus, Ohio 43215Non-Profit OrganizationKristin Helmick-Brunet, (614) 629-0347\nContract Compliance: The vendor number is 008897 and expires 3/17/2027.\n Fiscal Impact: There is no fiscal impact with this amendment.\nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 2395-2025 to authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a Grant Agreement with the Columbus Museum of Art; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule as provided for in the terms of the agreement; and to declare an emergency.
