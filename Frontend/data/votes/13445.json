    "description": "...Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Hazen and Sawyer for the Residuals Management Plan Update Project - Part 2, CIP #690540-100001, in an amount not to exceed $500,000.00.  \n \nWork performed to date under the initial contract included assistance with developing procurement documents for turnkey dewatering services, assistance with evaluating the resulting proposal, and assistance with developing contract documents for the turnkey services.  The work to be performed under modification 1 involved continued assistance with developing turnkey service contract documents, assistance with contract negotiations with the turnkey vendor, and providing engineering services during construction of the dewatering facility. The work performed under modification 2, included surveying and associated services to continue engineering services during construction, perform services for property splitting and assemblage at the MAQ for the dewatering facility, obtaining a beneficial use permit for the water treatment residuals, and other associated services for this MAQ turnkey project. The work to be performed under this modification, modification 3, includes services to continue engineering services during construction, perform assistance in submittal reviews, responses to RFIs, and review of commissioning services for the MAQ dewatering facility, contractor guarantee and warranty support, and other associated services for this MAQ turnkey project. These services are necessary to dewater, store, haul, and beneficially reuse water treatment residuals (WTR) sourced from the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP), Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP), and Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) and retained within the McKinley Avenue Quarry (MAQ). \n \nPlanning Area is Citywide - 99, because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1.  UPDATED TIMELINE & FUTURE RENEWALS\nThe initial contract started in June 2020.  This is the third of three planned contract modifications. This modification is anticipated to provide services through 2027.  This is the final modification planned with estimated beginning and end dates as follows:  modification number 3 - begins the 1st quarter of 2026 and ends in 2027.\n \n1.2.  ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT\nThis contract modification is expected to be $500,000.00.  No additional modifications are anticipated.  It is anticipated that total spending during the term of the project could total $1,729,000.00.  The amount of the initial contract and contract modifications is listed below.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract (Study) (PO230073,  Ordinance 1080-2024)                                          $    229,000.00\nModification Number 1 (PO372951, Ordinance 0056-2023)                                                  $    500,000.00\nModification Number 2 (PO479146, Ordinance 1809-2024)                                                  $    500,000.00\nModification Number 3 (current) (PO TBD, Ordinance 2483-2025)                             $    500,000.00\nESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                 $ 1,729,000.00\n \n1.3.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding.  This is one of the planned funding modifications so another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4.  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe City project team identified the services that would be needed for this contract over the modification period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services using existing contract job titles, hourly rates, and allowable expenses.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project team and final pricing was negotiated with the consultant.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nWater treatment facilities produce large volumes of residuals on a daily basis that must be continuously disposed of or reused.  Any disruption to the residuals handling operation can result in a shutdown to the water treatment system; thus, residuals handling is a critical component of the City’s water supply system.  This project is necessary to provide assistance to obtain turnkey beneficial use services of these water treatment residuals for the Division’s HCWP, DRWP, and PAWP so that DOW can continue to provide a long-term and reliable water supply to the central Ohio area.\n \n3.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHazen and Sawyer’s contract compliance number is CC000630 and expires 2/27/2026.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $500,000.00 are available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within Fund 6006 (Water Bond Fund) is also needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to add funding for the Residuals Management Plan Update Project - Part 2 with Hazen and Sawyer;
