    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes funds in an amount up to $12,000.00 to be spent by the City Attorney for expenses associated with acquiring the right-of-way needed for Walhalla Ravine Stream Restoration Project, C.I.P. No. 650870-110167.   \n \nThe City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) is engaged in the Walhalla Ravine Stream Restoration Project.  This project is part of the Blueprint Tulane/Findley Integrated Solution project.  It will stabilize 600 feet of the banks of the Walhalla Ravine with natural channel design while stabilizing that section of Walhalla Road.  The project will also reduce bank erosion which is expected to reduce total suspended solids by over 4 tons per year, partially achieving the water quality goals of the Blueprint Clintonville 3 projects.\n \nThe City must acquire in good faith and accept certain fee simple and lesser real estate located at the south end of the backyards of several properties along Walhalla Road between East Longview Ave and Clinton Heights, and on the east side of Walhalla Road south of Brynhild Road (collectively, “Real Estate”) in order for DPU to complete the Public Project. Accordingly, DPU requested the City Attorney to acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) in order for DPU to timely complete the Public Project.  Exhibits are attached to this Ordinance showing the details of the easements to be acquired for this project. \n \nOrdinance 0467-2024, passed by City Council on 3/18/24, authorized the expenditure of up to $60,000.00 to acquire right-of-way needed for this project along with other expenses associated with acquiring the right-of-way.  That was an estimated amount. Additional funds are needed to complete the acquisition.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nNot applicable. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $12,000.00 for this expenditure are available in the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109. An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to acquire the Real Estate and allow DPU to timely complete the Public Project improvements to this developing area before the sewer system can no longer accommodate the increased usage, preventing sewage overflow into storm water systems and basement flooding, thereby preserving the public peace, health, property, safety and welfare.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to spend City funds to acquire and accept in good faith certain fee simple and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Walhalla Road between East Longview Ave and Clinton Heights, and contract for associated professional services needed for the acquisition of Real Estate; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize an expenditure of up to $12,000.00 within the Sanitary Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
