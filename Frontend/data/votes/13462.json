    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Mid-Ohio Food Collective in support of its food distribution operations. This ordinance authorizes an upfront payment to Mid-Ohio Food Collective to support these efforts as need has greatly increased across its service area. Mid-Ohio Food Collective does not currently have sufficient funds on-hand to await reimbursement for expenses incurred.\n \nAs the federal shutdown continues through October and likely into November, the need for food only increases.  Funding from programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Women, Infants, & Children (WIC) is particularly at risk, as are the thousands of families in the Central Ohio region that depend on it.  As of last month, there were over 170,000 SNAP recipients in Franklin County alone, making use of $31 million in benefits.  If this funding is not received, the need at our City and state's food banks will increase exponentially.  The Mid-Ohio Food Collective is a non-profit organization that services twenty counties in Ohio, and is the largest food bank in the state.  Its mission is to end hunger one nourishing meal at a time while co-creating communities where everyone thrives.  Columbus City Council is providing $25,000.00 in additional funding for Mid-Ohio Food Collective for its food distribution operations, which may be expended on food and non-alcoholic beverages, to assist those in need now and through the holiday season.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $25,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is requested in order for Mid-Ohio Food Collective to immediately address the food distribution need exacerbated by the federal shutdown.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Mid-Ohio Foodbank dba Mid-Ohio Food Collective in support of its food distribution operations; to authorize the expenditure of $25,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the expenditure of funds on reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses; and to declare an emergency. ($25,000.00)  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is need to provide support and resources to our food banks, which will be facing greater need as the federal shutdown affects food assistance programs such as SNAP and WIC; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Mid-Ohio Foodbank is a non-profit organization that services twenty counties in Ohio, and is the largest food bank in the state; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing support of $25,000.00 in support of their food distribution needs; and \n \nWHEREAS, $25,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is necessary for the Clerk to enter into a grant agreement immediately with the Mid-Ohio Foodbank to address the food distribution need exacerbated by the federal shutdown, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Mid-Ohio Foodbank dba Mid-Ohio Food Collective in support of its general operations.\n \nSECTION 2.

That the purchase and distribution of food and beverage corresponding to the program’s activities are deemed to serve a public purpose for the reasons stated in the Explanation portion of this ordinance, and that the total expenditure authorized in Section 2 may be expended on food and non-alcoholic beverages.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
