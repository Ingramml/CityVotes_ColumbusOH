    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1 project, CIP #650724-100000, in an amount up to $1,888,917.00.\n \nThe proposed Lower Olentangy Tunnel will work in tandem with the four pillars of the Blueprint Columbus program to enable the City to address several elements of its sewer consent orders that the four pillars alone cannot address and will also improve water quality in the Olentangy River.  The project will provide hydraulic relief to both the Franklin Main Interceptor Sewer and the Olentangy Scioto Interceptor Sewer near Second Avenue and near Lane Avenue; it will control the seven upper Olentangy combined sewer overflows per the consent order; mitigate the activation of four designed sewer relief structures per the consent order; and allow closure of a fifth designed sewer overflow structure.  This contract modification will fund the continuation of design services through plan signature, engineering services during construction bidding and approximately six months into construction.   \n \nWork completed to-date under this contract:\n•   The original contract included the review of existing information, preliminary field investigations, preliminary geotechnical investigation, and a preliminary design report.  \n•   Modification No. 1 included a large portion of the detailed design, final geotechnical investigation, and survey and easement preparation.  \n•   Modification No. 2 included completion of detailed design, production of specifications, and bidding related services.  \n•   Modification No. 3 included engineering services during construction for the first year.\n•   Modification No. 4 included the continuation of engineering services during construction for the second year.  \n•   Modification No. 5 included the continuation of engineering services during construction for the third year. \n•   Modification No. 6 will include the completion of engineering services during construction and the commissioning of the tunnel.  This will be the final planned contract modification. \n \nThe project is located within the Downtown, Near North/University and West Olentangy community areas.  The Community Area used for the ordinance will be “99 - Citywide” because the work associated with this contract serves multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,888,917.00\nOriginal Contract                                $5,488,356.22 (PO018717 / ORD 1315-2016) \n                     Mod.

No. 3                   $1,979,602.00 (PO270796 / ORD 0613-2021)\n                     Mod. No. 4                              $1,960,034.50 (PO316380 / ORD 0133-2022)\n                     Mod. No. 5                              $1,884,000.00 (PO383201 / ORD 0590-2023)\n                                          Mod. No. 6                   $1,888,917.00 (current)                     \n                     TOTAL                        $24,086,332.44\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process as a multi-year contract with planned modifications to add funding until the construction project is complete.  Another procurement process is not required. \n  \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work using established contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed the proposal and negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe project was identified in the Integrated Plan and 2015 Waste Water Management Plan Update Report which was developed with input from numerous stakeholder groups and submitted to the Ohio EPA.  The project will mitigate sewer overflows into the Olentangy River as described in the report. \n \n3.
