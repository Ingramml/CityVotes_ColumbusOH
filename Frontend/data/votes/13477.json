    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the assignment of all past, present, and future business done by the City of Columbus with T4S Partners, Inc., to Kanchi Technologies 2i LLC. This change will reflect a company name change for all contracts and purchase orders established with T4S Partners, Inc.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to renew the contract with Kanchi Technologies 2i LLC, formerly known as T4S Partners, Inc., for support and maintenance of Ivanti Neurons software for the contract amount of $98,356.20. \n \nDoT is currently using Cherwell ITSM for information technology service management. Ivanti purchased Cherwell in 2021 and merged Cherwell functionality into their more modern product, Ivanti Neurons. This software is enabling DoT to build a modern service catalog and knowledge base to track and manage service requests and issues that impact the city.\n \nOn September 15, 2023, DoT opened solicitation number RFQ025678 to procure Ivanti Neurons ITSM software licensing, software maintenance and support, training, integration, and software implementation services. Three responses were received. After reviewing the proposals, it was recommended that the award be made to T4S Partners Inc, who scored the highest of all the proposals received.\n \nOrdinance 3026-2023, passed on November 20, 2023, authorized entering a contract with T4S Partners, Inc. to purchase and maintain Ivanti Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) software.

The original contract was for one year from the date of a confirmed purchase order, with four optional one-year renewals with the approval of City Council. This ordinance represents the second of the four allowable, optional renewals for support and maintenance of Ivanti Neurons software.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the second renewal at a total cost of $98,356.20 for a period of twelve (12) months, starting on February 20, 2026, and ending on February 19, 2027.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to modify and extend the existing agreement with Kanchi Technologies 2i LLC, formerly T4S Partners, Inc., through the extension of purchase order PO431170 for an additional year.  There are no funds associated with this extension. Rather, the extension ensures access to the balance of funds on the above-mentioned purchase order for an additional year. \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended\nThe original contract amount:                        $450,637.00 (PO431170, Ord. 3026-2023)\nNegotiated renewal #1:                                                 $98,356.20 (PO481377, Ord. 2789-2024)\nNegotiated renewal #2:                                                 $98,356.20 (This ordinance)\n \nTOTAL CONTRACT AMOUNT WITH RENEWALS: $647,349.40\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Kanchi Technologies 2i LLC\nDAX vendor no.: 053669\nExpiration Date: 9/23/2027\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $98,356.20 is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund, Fund 5100.
