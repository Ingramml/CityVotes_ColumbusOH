    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Remanufactured and OEM Ink Cartridges with US Laser LLC, CC# CC-005163, expires August 8, 2026.  This contract provides ink cartridges used by all City agencies.  Ink, toner, and accessories are used for printing and copying.  This modification is necessary to ensure that ink cartridges are readily available for printing and copying needs. The contract, PO361488 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ022851 and will expire December 31, 2025. It is in the best interest of the City that the contract be modified to allow for an extension for a period of one (1)  year to and including December 31, 2026, to ensure the products are supplied to help maintain copy and print equipment.\n \nPursuant to Section 329.09(a) of Columbus City Codes:\n(1) Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: For UTCs, no additional funding will be immediately necessary for a modification, but if the modification deals with price changes or added items, please explain that users of the UTC will have to secure their own funding for use of the UTC for the additional price/additional item as they place orders. N/A\n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A\n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: N/A\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: N/A\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency because the current contract expires December 31, 2025 and ink, toner and accessories need to be readily available for printing and copying needs Citywide.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Departments must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend the contract for the option to purchase Remanufactured and OEM Ink Cartridges with US Laser LLC, and to declare an emergency.
