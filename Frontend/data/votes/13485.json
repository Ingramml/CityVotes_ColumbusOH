The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $36,875.00 was established.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on April 17, 2025.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Effler Commercial, LLC at the reduced cost of $27,500.00 to them.\n                     \n2. FISCAL IMPACT\nThe City will receive a total of $27,500.00 and the funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of a 0.068 acre portion of right-of-way near Western Avenue to Effler Commercial, LLC or an affiliated entity, provided said entity is the owner of all property abutting the right-of-way at the time of transfer.
