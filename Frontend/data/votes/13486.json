    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into an agreement with and contribute funding to the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to support the completion of feasibility studies related to the LinkUS initiative. \nLinkUS is a collaborative transportation and growth plan developed by the City of Columbus, the Franklin County Board of Commissioners, the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), and the Columbus Partnership, which seeks to expand transit and to create more walkable communities in Central Ohio, increasing opportunities for residents. Together, MORPC and its regional partners have identified more than 80 projects aimed at creating more than 150 miles of new sidewalks, bikeways, and trails across the region within the first five years of implementation. \nIn a letter dated November 21, 2023, to MORPC, the Department of Public Service expressed support for an application by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office seeking $320,000 in MORPC Attributable Funds to study the feasibility of certain Transit-Supportive Infrastructure (TSI) projects recommended for completion as part of LinkUS. The Department of Public Service also committed to contribute up to $80,000 to the Franklin County Engineer’s Office for that purpose. \nThe purpose of this legislation is to authorize the execution of a contribution or reimbursement agreement between the Department of Public Service and the Franklin County Engineer’s Office related to the LinkUS TSI Feasibility Studies and the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funding to pay the City’s proportional share of the actual cost of those studies. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $79,051.00 is available and appropriated for this project in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of funds is necessary to align spending with the proper project.\n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to enable the City to make payment to the Franklin County Engineer’s Office on or before November 28, 2025.\nTitle\nTo amend the 2025 Capital Improvement budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contribution or reimbursement agreement with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office and to provide funding to the same relative to the completion of the LinkUS TSI Feasibility Studies; to authorize the expenditure of $79,051.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
