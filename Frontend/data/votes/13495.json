    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing not-for-profit service contract with the Ohio State University Physicians, Inc., (OSUP) for specialized physician services in the Ben Franklin Tuberculosis (TB) Clinic. This modification is to add funding in the amount of $10,000.00, for a new total contract amount of $75,000.00, for the current contract term of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025.\n \nOSUP provides outpatient care throughout Central Ohio and is the approved practice plan for The Ohio State University College of Medicine designated by the University Board of Trustees. This contractor is a nonprofit organization and is exempt from certification.\n \nColumbus Public Health has a need to increase physician services specializing in infectious disease with expertise in Tuberculosis including consultation and other coverage as needed. Cost estimates for calendar year 2025 were based on historic case rates, however the acuity of some TB cases has increased resulting in the need for more physician consultation hours for those cases. \n \nThe current pricing is based on the OSUP physician hourly rate of $130 per hour and is based on the estimated number of hours after reviewing 3rd quarter billings.  \n \nIt would not be in the best interest of the City to not award this contract through other procurement processes due to the specificity of the physician specialization and relationship with local hospital systems. Our physician also serves as the medical director of the Ben Franklin TB Clinic. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The amount of $10,000.00 is budgeted in the Health Department Grant Fund for physician services for Columbus Public Health. ($10,000.00) \n \nEMERGENCY: There is an immediate need to increase this contract in the amount of $10,000 to allow for continued consultation and continued infectious disease treatment for patients of the Ben Franklin TB Clinic. Failure to manage TB patients according to medical standards will significantly increase the risk of TB transmission in Franklin County.\n \n Title\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to modify an existing not-for-profit contract with Ohio State University Physicians (OSUP) to add funding in the amount of $10,000.00 for the current contract period of January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $10,000.00 from the Health Department Grant fund; and to declare an emergency. ($10,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health has a need to modify an existing contract for specialized physician services for the current contract period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Ohio State University Physicians, Inc., can provide physicians who have the expertise required; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to contract with the Ohio State University Physicians, Inc., for specialized physician services in order to ensure continuity of care for patients of Columbus Public Health Ben Franklin Tuberculosis Clinic, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify the existing contract with the Ohio State University Physicians, Inc. (OSUP) to add funding in the amount of $10,000.00, for a new total contract amount of $75,000.00, for the current contract period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the costs of said contract, the expenditure of $10,000.00 is hereby authorized from the Health Department Grant Fund, Fund No. 2251, Department of Health, Division No. 5001, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this contract is in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
