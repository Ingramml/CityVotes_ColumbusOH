    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to apply for, accept, and execute a private grant from the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund in an amount up to $50,000.00 to incorporate legacy planning into the free one-on-one financial counseling service currently offered by the Financial Empowerment Center.  \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Jewish Family Service (a not-for-profit agency) for FEC financial counselors to receive additional training specific to the legacy planning process and  training to provide clients access to a will-based legacy plan through an online will-generation software in an amount up to $50,000.00.  This contract will be in an amount up to $25,000.00 for year one of the grant and then the remaining $25,000.00 will be entered into upon year two of the grant.  \n \nLegacy planning is a service that includes putting a formal plan in place for how you want the people and things you’re responsible for to be taken care of when you can’t make decisions yourself. This includes organizing assets, reviewing insurance and titles, updating account beneficiaries, and preparing legacy planning documents such as a will, guardianship plans, or power of attorney. \n \nPlanning for the transfer of wealth, estate, or other assets to a beneficiary is a complex process, highlighting the need for financial counseling in this area. Legacy planning services can also be expensive, adding an additional barrier to accessing this important service.  \n \nThe FEC already provides free one-on-one financial counseling services supporting all central Ohio residents in a variety of needs, from guiding clients in increasing their savings and credit score to assisting small business owners with their personal finances to launch and sustain a small business. \n \nThis grant will provide the necessary resources and training to expand financial counseling services to include legacy planning which will round out the services provided by the FEC and support central Ohio adults with financial wellness support in all stages of life. Building generational wealth begins with financial decisions made in the present to support future financial stability and prosperity for families and in turn, the financial security of all residents in Central Ohio.\n \nEmergency Action is necessary to ensure funding is available to continue the support of the FEC, allowing for the continuous provision of services to Columbus residents through crucial financial counseling services. Jewish Family Services (a not-for-profit agency) currently administers the FEC on behalf of the City and will be administering this portion of the program as financial counseling services cannot be provided by existing city employees. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation requests approval of the Auditor’s Office to appropriate up to $50,000.00 within the Private Grant Fund (Fund 2291), grant number to be determined, for this grant.  Funding from this grant will be distributed to the City in three tranches:  $25,000.00 upon execution of the grant agreement, $15,000.00 upon receipt and approval of the interim report, and the remaining $10,000.00 will be paid upon receipt of the final report and documentation of at least $40,000.00 of the grant funds have been disbursed.  \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to accept and execute a private grant from Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE) in an amount up to $50,000.00 to incorporate legacy planning into the financial counseling services that the Financial Empowerment Center currently offers; to authorize the appropriation in an amount up to $50,000.00 which will be reimbursed upon receipt of the grant funds at various stages of the process; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute a not-for-profit service contract with Jewish Family Service  the expenditure in an amount up to $25,000.00 for year one of the grant and be effective as of June 1, 2025 and the additional $25,000.00 to be entered into in year two of the grant; and to declare an emergency.
