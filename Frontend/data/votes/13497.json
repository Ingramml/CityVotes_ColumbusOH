    "description": "Explanation\n \nOrdinance 2248-2023 authorized the City Auditor to transfer $200,000.00 within the General Fund; authorized the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (\"Municipal Court Clerk\") to enter into a contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier service; allowed  the” Municipal Court Clerk to enter into the program established by the Ohio Association of Municipal/County Court Clerks which allows courts to have exclusive pricing and service to aid in the delivery of court documents unmatched by the state term contract. The program utilizes the OneRate pricing program from FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”). Through the implementation process, it was discovered by CourtView Justice Solution, Inc. that the OneRate pricing program needed to be added to the portal. Ordinance 1164-2024 authorized the program change to be implemented. \nOrdinance 1468-2024 authorized the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract with FedEx to add an additional pricing agreement. FedEx agreed to change the pricing agreement to allow the FedEx Portal to issue out FedEx mailers by the Two-Day Rate while the OneRate programming is being added. This allowed the Municipal Court Clerk to start offering commercial carrier service in August.  \nOrdinance 2721-2024 legislation authorized the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract with FedEx to waive the additional $1.00 fee that is being added to the Two-Day Rate shipments. FedEx has agreed to waive the $1.00 additional fee since they are offering us the OneRate pricing. This allowed commercial carrier service to continue to be issued at the agreed upon price. \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of the Municipal Court Clerk to use the State Term Contract and modify the existing contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier service. The state term contract fits the needs of Municipal Court Clerk better than the program established by the Ohio Association of Municipal/County Court Clerks. Although the rate is lower when using the established Courts agreement, the state term contract allows for consistent billing and understanding of government processes that is lacking in the Courts agreement. All and all this change will help the Municipal Court Clerk continue to provide commercial carry services consistently and effectively. \nContract Compliance: 71-0427007\nExpiration Date: 10/20/2027\nDAX Vendor Number: 009933\n \nFiscal Impact:  No additional funds are required.\n \nEmergency: There is an immediate need to modify the contract to the state term  contract rates to ensure that services may continue uninterrupted. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of the Municipal Court Clerk to use the State Term Contract and modify the existing contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier service; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Municipal Court Clerk's Office has a need to use the State Term Contract and modify the existing contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier service; and                            \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to use the State Term Contract and modify the existing contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier service to transition from the current pricing to the Government State Term Contract  pricing, so that services may continue uninterrupted, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n             \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf  Municipal Court Clerk is authorized and directed to use the State Term Contract and modify the existing contract with FedEx for the provision of commercial carrier service. \nSECTION 2.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure, which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approved by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
