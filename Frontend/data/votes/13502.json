    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes funds in the amount of up to $50,000.00, to be spent by the City Attorney for expenses associated with acquiring the right-of-way needed for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1, C.I.P. No. 650724-100000.   \n \nThe City of Columbus entered into two consent orders with the Ohio EPA in 2002 and 2004 to address sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). To comply, the city developed a long-term plan that evolved into Blueprint Columbus. This plan focuses on removing stormwater from the sanitary sewer system through various green infrastructure projects, which is a more integrated and community-focused approach than the original gray infrastructure-heavy plan.  The Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1 project is one of the projects undertaken to comply with the consent orders.\n \nThe City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) is engaged in the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1, C.I.P. No. 650724-100000 (“Public Project”).  This project is constructing a sewer tunnel in the Olentangy corridor for relief of the Olentangy combined sewer overflows and area Trunk Sewers, reducing CSOs to a typical year level of service.  The tunnel will extend from the Henry Street Regulator (OARS shaft 6) to Tuttle Park.  It will provide relief to the Olentangy Main, OSIS, Franklin Main, Clinton #3, and Kinnear Sub-Trunk sewers.  \n \nThe City must acquire in good faith and accept certain fee simple and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Tuttle Park and located 320 feet west of the intersection of Neil Ave and Hudson St. (collectively, “Real Estate”) for DPU to complete the Public Project.  Accordingly, DPU requested the City Attorney to acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) for DPU to complete the Public Project timely.  Exhibits are attached to this Ordinance showing the details of the needed easements.\n \nThe Real Estate is in Columbus Community 44 - University District.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nNot applicable.\n  \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $50,000.00 are available in the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109. An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION\nEmergency action is requested as Real Estate is needed to complete the project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to spend City funds to acquire and accept in good faith certain fee simple and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Tuttle Park for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1 project; to contract for associated professional services in order for the Department of Public Utilities to timely complete the acquisition of Real Estate for the project; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
