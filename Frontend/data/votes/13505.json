    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into contract with Touchstone IQ LLC for software licensing, maintenance services, and technical services in the amount of $155,740.00.\n \nAs the Energy Benchmarking Code, Chapter 4117, has matured, so have the technical needs of the program. Initially, BZS had a contract with Touchstone IQ for the use of the tool for benchmarking data and communications. The solution is custom built for public officials and allows staff and public officials to efficiently triage incoming communications, reply to those messages and conduct communication and data analysis. The transparency map, a component of the Energy Benchmarking Code, was a supplemental contract with Touchstone IQ that provides information about the physical features of a Covered Property and its operational characteristics, which is shared with the public.\n \nLast year, BZS worked with Touchstone IQ and Columbia Gas to add the ability for customers to have online access and direct auto upload of aggregate utility natural gas consumption data to the EPA’s ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® tool. This was accomplished by creating an independent portal and co-branded website with a user access system to facilitate the customer auto-upload process. Providing Columbus building owners with access to aggregate whole-building energy data is fundamental to the success of the Energy Benchmarking Code, the Columbus Climate Action Plan, and is an invaluable service to Columbus building owners. It is necessary to combine all components of the software licenses and maintenance at this time. Combining the contracts will allow for a more efficient and effective way to manage these tools. The contract will be for one year, beginning January 1, 2026, and ending December 31, 2026.\n \nTouchstone IQ LLC is the sole proprietor and manufacturer of Touchstone IQ software products. Thus, Touchstone IQ software licenses and support can only be provided by Touchstone IQ. As such, this ordinance is submitted in accordance with the provisions of sole source procurement of Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $155,740.00 for the above-described purpose.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are budgeted and available in the Department of Building and Zoning Services’ Development Services Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: Touchstone IQ LLC (D365 Vendor Account # 032992)\nContract compliance number: CC-032992; Exp. 12/12/2026\nState of Ohio Number 5154184\nThe company is not disbarred according to the excluded party listing system of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved finding for recovery certified search.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into contract with Touchstone IQ LLC for software licensing, maintenance, and technical services in accordance with the provisions of sole source procurement of Columbus City Codes; and to authorize the expenditure of $155,740.00 from the Development Services Fund.
