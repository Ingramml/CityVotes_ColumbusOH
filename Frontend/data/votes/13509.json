    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract in an amount up to $44,000.00 with The Homeless Families Foundation for organizing temporary housing and essential services for participants of the department’s Displaced Tenant Services program.\n \nWhen a structure is not fit for human habitation as deemed by the City of Columbus through departments such as Building and Zoning Services, the City must require the occupants to vacate the unit until it is brought into compliance. This disruptive displacement may harm the residents and have a cascading effect on their well-being, for example by disturbing employment or education transportation; destabilizing social connections; and significantly increasing stress. \n \nDue to the current housing crisis, securing new housing quickly is also extremely difficult, especially for our most vulnerable residents who are more likely to receive a vacate order. These vacated residents often need immediate assistance to avoid homelessness, including emergency temporary housing, rental assistance, help locating housing, and other additional supports to promote stability.\n \nThe goal of Displaced Tenant Services is to mitigate the effects of disruptive displacement. This program provides relocation support to residents who are emergency vacated by the City of Columbus by:\n•                     Offering reasonable and necessary temporary housing during the displacement, as needed\n•                     Securing an alternative, permanent housing option OR the tenant returning to the original unit\n•                     Providing all essential services to accomplish the above\n \nThe Homeless Families Foundation acts as the program’s Temporary Housing Coordinator, organizing temporary housing and essential services for tenants, while also providing housing focused case management services. HFF collaborates with the program’s Fiscal Manager, The Tony R. Wells Foundation, to pay for the hotels at the time of the emergency. They also collaborate with the entire program team, including Columbus Public Health Social Work, R.H. Brown and Co professional relocation services, and The Department of Development’s Division of Housing Stability.\n \nThe Homeless Families Foundation (HFF) provided similar services under a separate not-for-profit service contract, PO476464, with the Department of Development, funded by the Emergency Rental Assistance grant.  This contract expired on September 30, 2025.  HFF continues to serve Columbus residents in need and this ordinance will also authorize expenditures incurred prior to the purchase order, starting October 1, 2025.  This agreement may be renewed once, pending authorization by City Council.\n \nThat Columbus City Council acknowledges and defines as operating costs inherent to the mission of this non-profit the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages for populations experiencing homelessness, housing insecurity, and/or food insecurity.  Any or all of the expenditure authorized by this ordinance may be spent toward payment of food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses for such populations.  Expenses incurred prior to the creation of a purchase order may be reimbursed.  However, in no case may food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses incurred prior to the date of the original legislation adoption be reimbursed.  City Council declares that the expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses authorized by this ordinance to be for a proper public purpose.\n \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.  \n \nEmergency action is requested to continue the work of providing temporary accommodations for those who are vacated from their homes due to emergency conditions.                     \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Department’s Business Tax Incentive fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 025439 and expires 4/3/2027.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract in an amount up to $44,000.00 with The Homeless Families Foundation; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $44,000.00 from the Housing Business Tax Incentive fund; to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for residents; to approve expenditures incurred prior to the approval of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
