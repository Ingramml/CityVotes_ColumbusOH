    "description": "Explanation\nThe annual City of Columbus (the “CITY”) Tax Incentive Review Council (the “TIRC”) was held on August 22, 2025 to evaluate the compliance status of the CITY’s property tax related incentives - Enterprise Zone Agreements, Post-1994 Community Reinvestment Area Agreements, and Tax Increment Finance Districts - for Reporting Year 2024. The Ohio Revised Code (under Section 5709.85) stipulates that on the basis of the determinations of the TIRC, on or before the first day of September of each year, the TIRC must submit to the legislative authority written recommendations for continuation, modification or cancellation of each agreement. Additionally, a legislative authority that receives such recommendations must, within sixty (60) days of receipt, hold a meeting and vote to accept, reject, or modify all or any portion of the recommendations. In a memorandum from the Director of the Department of Development to Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”) dated October 20, 2025, the results of the TIRC were presented and attached to this memorandum titled “2025 TIRC Council Summary of Recommendations.” This resolution is requested to be considered to fulfill the stipulations set forth in Section 5709.85 of the Ohio Revised Code and by this resolution will accept the recommendations of the 2025 TIRC.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is required to allow the Department of Development to implement the recommendations of the TIRC in an expedient manner as adjustments to the monitoring and administration of economic development agreements move forward.\n \nTitle\nTo accept the recommendations of the 2025 Columbus Tax Incentive Review Council regarding the continuation, modification or cancellation of all property tax incentives based on the evaluation of Reporting Year 2024; and to declare an emergency.
