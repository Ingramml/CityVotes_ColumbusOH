    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this ordinance is to provide financial support to Columbus Recreation and Parks Foundation's Adopt-a-Center Program. Adopt-a-Center is an annual community initiative led by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Foundation that brings holiday joy and essential resources to families across Columbus. Through partnerships with local businesses, civic groups, and individual donors, the program “adopts” more than 30 Columbus Recreation and Parks community centers and programs each year to provide warm meals, winter clothing, hygiene items, toys, and household essentials to residents in need. In 2024, Adopt-a-Center served over 8,000 Columbus residents by distributing more than 6,500 meals and thousands of gifts to youth, families, and seniors. The program helps ensure that every family, regardless of income, can celebrate the holiday season. By engaging volunteers and donors citywide, Adopt-a-Center fosters a stronger, more compassionate community while supporting the mission of connecting people through nature, wellness, and creativity.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018.\n \nREASON FOR EMERGENCY: The Adopt-a-Center program takes place before the holidays and during the holidays. If this legislation is not passed on an emergency basis, funds may not be available until after the program concludes.
