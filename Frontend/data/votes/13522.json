    "description": "Explanation\n \n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation will authorize the Board of Health to enter into a contract with DAS Health Ventures, LLC., for the archival of health record data from our existing electronic medical record system and hosting services for the period of November 15, 2025, through December 31, 2025, in an amount not to exceed $55,300.00 \n \nColumbus Public Health (CPH) is in the process of implementing a new electronic medical record system and this service will allow CPH to access existing medical records after our current system, NextGen, is decommissioned. The proposed agreement will provide health record archival and hosting services. \n \nDAS Health Ventures, LLC (DAS), is our current consultant who contracts with both CPH and Department of Technology on NextGen-related services such as training, template development, SQL development, SQL performance tuning, interface assistance, and performance tuning. Because of the specialized expertise in our current electronic medical record system, CPH is requesting the competitive bidding provisions outlined in Chapter 329.18 of the Columbus City Code be waived. \n \nDAS contract compliance certificate is #CC-041006. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this contract are available and budgeted in the Health Department Grant fund.\n \nEMERGENCY: Emergency legislation is requested to provide immediate funding for this critical component of the transition to our new electronic medical record software system. Proper archival of health records meets legal compliance for data retention and provides continuity of care by preserving patients' medical histories. This contract is funded by the recently reinstated Enhanced Operations Grant which requires that all contracts be executed and services completed prior to the grant end of December 31, 2025. Failure to execute this agreement will result in a loss of the total contract amount for reimbursement.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into a contract with DAS Health Ventures, LLC., for data archival and hosting services for the period of November 15, 2025, through December 31, 2025, in an amount not to exceed $55,300.00; to authorize the expenditure of $55,300.00 from the Health Department Grant fund; to waive competitive bidding requirements; and to declare an emergency. ($55,300.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Board of Health on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, to enter into a contract with DAS Health Ventures, LLC., for data archival and hosting services of electronic medical records; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract period is November 15, 2025 through December 31, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the Columbus Public Health Department to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the critical operation of transitioning electronic medical record software systems and it is necessary to authorize the Board to enter into a contract with DAS Health Ventures, LLC., to meet the December 31, 2025 end of grant period for the Enhanced Operations Grant, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with DAS Health Ventures, LLC., for the period of November 15, 2025, through December 31, 2025, in an amount not to exceed $55,300.00.\n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the cost of said contract, the expenditure of $55,300.00 is hereby authorized from the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, Department No. 50, Division 5001, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this Council finds it is in the best interest of the city to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to competitive bidding to permit the aforementioned purchase.   \n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
