    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc., for construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities construction projects bid during the calendar years 2023 through 2025 as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contracts.  \n \nPrime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. will be assigned construction projects as tasks on their contract and will ensure the work is performed to City of Columbus construction standards and specifications.  As projects are added to the contract, the contract will be modified to authorize Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. to perform the work and to add funding to pay for the work.\n \nThe construction projects to be administered by Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. under this contract modification are the Lead Service Line Replacements - Pilot Program, CIP #690236-100178, in an amount not to exceed $298,967.91, and the Lead Service Line Replacements - Part 2, CIP #690236-110001, in an amount not to exceed $1,261,686.04.  The Lead Service Line Replacements - Pilot Program project was previously bid, has been modified to add additional work, and needs to have additional construction administration/inspection services funding added for the additional work.  The Lead Service Line Replacements - Part 2 project is currently going through the bid award process.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Community Planning Area “99- Citywide.”\n \n1.1.                     Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,560,653.95\n \nOriginal Contract                                                               $   201,851.31 (ORD 1727-2023; PO411801)\nModification #1:                                                                                    $     72,154.14 (ORD 1803-2023; PO419003)\nModification#2:                                                                                    $1,204,608.25 (ORD3237-2023; PO428570, PO42857, \nPO428580, PO428584, PO428589)\nModification #3:                                                                                    $   350,000.12 (ORD 1618-2024; PO461720)\nModification #4                                                                $     70,310.34 (ORD 1640-2024; PO469578)\nModification #5                                                                $1,783,848.34 (ORD 3022-2024; PO503546)\nModification #6                                                                $   217,365.42 (ORD 0196-2025; PO505402)\nModification #7                                                                $1,427,800.45 (ORD 1002-2025; PO518825)\nModification #8                                                                $   127,171.68 (ORD 1891-2025; PO527579)\nModification #9 (Current)                                          $1,560,653.95 (ORD 2485-2025)\nTotal:                                                                                                         $7,015,764.00 \n \n1.2.  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025 for which modifications were anticipated pursuant to the original authorizing legislation under Ordinance 1727-2023 to account for future construction projects being assigned to Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. \n \n1.3.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.   \n \n1.4.  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency and valves that are inoperable.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nPrime Construction Management & Survey, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-024771 and expires 7/1/27.  \n  \nAs part of this contract Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. has not proposed the use of subcontractors for this project.  The certification of Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. is in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nLead Service Line Replacements - Pilot Program, CIP #690236-100178\nThe construction administration/inspection services contract for the Lead Service Line Replacements - Pilot Program project is expected to be financed through the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0700-2025, passed by Council on 3/31/25.  This Ordinance did not list this project as one of the projects expected to be financed with this loan program.  Section 2 of Ordinance 0700-2025 does give City Council’s approval for projects to be added to the list.    \n \nAn amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, in the amount of $298,967.91 is needed to fund this contract.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Reserve Funds.  The loan is expected to be approved in December, 2025.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new Fund. \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  A purchase order will need to be established to Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc., for these services.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc., and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nLead Service Line Replacements - Part 2, CIP #690236-110001\nThe construction administration/inspection services contract for the Lead Service Line Replacements - Part 2 project is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized the application and acceptance of funding through this program via Ordinance 0348-2025, passed by Council on 4/28/25.  \n \nAn amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the WSRLA Loan Fund, Fund 6011, in the amount of $1,261,686.04 is needed to fund this contract.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Reserve Funds.  The loan is expected to be approved in December, 2025.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new Fund. \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.  The use of lead water lines is a public health hazard that must be eliminated as quickly as possible.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Prime Construction Management & Survey, Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund to the WSRLA Loan Fund and to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; to appropriate funds in the WSRLA Loan Fund and in the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; to authorize the application and acceptance of loan funding from the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program; to authorize the expenditure of funds from the WSRLA Loan Fund and in the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund to pay for this contract modification; and to declare an emergency.
