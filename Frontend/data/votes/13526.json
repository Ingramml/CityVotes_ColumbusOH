    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement (Modification No. 3) with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $514,100.00 to assist individuals facing housing instability, emergency vacate orders, or potential homelessness with funding for temporary accommodations and other necessary relocation expenses as part of the Displaced Tenant Services program.  This modification will also extend the agreement term, currently expiring on December 31, 2025, to March 31, 2026.  As it was authorized with the original agreement, this grant modification will include advancement of funds per a pre-determined schedule.\n \nOriginal                                                         $   65,000.00                            Ord. 1686-2024                      PO467735\nMod 1                                                        $ 150,000.00                                           Ord. 3360-2024                                          PO485707\nMod 2                                                                                    $   50,000.00                                          Ord. 1994-2025                                          PO522914\nMod 3                                                                                    $ 514,100.00\nTotal                                                             $ 779,100.00         \n \nDue to the current housing crisis, securing new housing quickly is also extremely difficult, especially for our most vulnerable residents who are more likely to receive a vacate order. These vacated residents often need immediate assistance to avoid homelessness, including emergency temporary housing, rental assistance, help locating housing, and other additional supports to promote stability.\n \nThe goal of Displaced Tenant Services is to mitigate the effects of disruptive displacement. This program provides relocation support to residents who are emergency vacated by the City of Columbus by:\n•                     Offering reasonable and necessary temporary housing during the displacement, as needed\n•                     Securing an alternative, permanent housing option OR the tenant returning to the original unit\n•                     Providing all essential services to accomplish the above\n \nThe Tony R. Wells Foundation acts as the program’s Fiscal Manager, making payments for temporary accommodations and other necessary relocation expenses. The Tony R. Wells Foundation collaborates with the entire program team, including Columbus Public Health Social Work, R.H. Brown and Co professional relocation services, Homes for Families, and The Department of Development’s Division of Housing Stability.\n \nUnder this agreement, funding is included for recipients’ needs and a fee for the Tony R Wells Foundation acting as the fiscal manager.  \n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of the additional funds to be expended is $514,100.00.\n2.                     The Department of Development could not predict the rate at which the initial funds would be expended to meet the needs of the community’s most vulnerable residents.\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to continue with the Tony R Wells Foundation’s current contract as they are the acting fiscal manager for The Displaced Tenants program. \n4.                     The amount of this modification is based on the availability of funds and not a pricing strategy.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to have funding available as soon as possible to assist residents who are displaced and need immediate assistance for transitional housing to prevent homelessness.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the Housing Business Tax Incentive fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s number is 038668 and expires on 05/22/2027.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement with the Tony R Wells Foundation dba The Wells Foundation in an amount up to $514,100.00 to provide assistance to individuals facing housing instability; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $514,100.00 from the Housing Business Tax Incentive fund; to extend the agreement to March 31, 2026; to authorize advance payments per a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
