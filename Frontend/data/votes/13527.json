    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into grant agreements with the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, the Children’s Hunger Alliance, Lifecare Alliance, and Columbus City Schools in support of their respective food distribution operations. This funding support is necessary due to the continued threatened cessation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and gaps in that funding. \nAccording to data from Ohio Jobs and Family Services, approximately 12.8% of households in Columbus receive SNAP benefits. These benefits are crucial to preventing hunger and supporting food security among the City’s residents. Franklin County has 173,523 SNAP beneficiaries obtaining approximately $31 million per month in benefits. Additionally, Columbus City Schools estimates that approximately 29,000 students receive SNAP benefits. For many of these households, SNAP benefits constitute the primary or sole means by which they can afford to purchase food. The suspension of SNAP benefits will have immediate and severe consequences for Columbus and its residents. When those benefits are suspended, the burden of meeting basic nutritional needs falls to local government and nonprofit service providers that already operate at capacity.The city recognizes that a TRO was granted on 10.31.25, and anticipates that the benefits to eligible recipients will be made available sometime this month. Due to the gap period, however, the city is requesting emergency funding to be able to serve the community during this time. \n \nThe City’s community partners-including local food pantries-have reported an increase in residents seeking emergency food assistance since the federal government shutdown began in early October. If November SNAP benefits are not issued, the City anticipates a surge in food insecurity and hunger that will far exceed available resources.\nThe Mid-Ohio Food Collective is a non-profit organization that services twenty counties in Ohio, and is the largest food bank in the state.  Its mission is to end hunger one nourishing meal at a time while co-creating communities where everyone thrives.  Founded in 1970, the Children’s Hunger Alliance is a statewide nonprofit organization dedicated to ending childhood hunger. They collaborate with organizations throughout Ohio to provide nutritious meals to at-risk children who need them most. LifeCare Alliance is a nonprofit human services organization that provides a comprehensive array of health and nutrition services to residents of central Ohio. LifeCare Alliance’s mission is to lead our community in identifying and delivering health and nutrition services to meet the community’s changing needs\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is requested in order for the community partners to immediately address the food distribution need exacerbated by the federal shutdown and the continued threat of the cessation of SNAP benefits.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $695,000.00 from the Health Special Revenue Fund collectively with the Mid-Ohio Food Collective, the Children’s Hunger Alliance, Lifecare Alliance, and Columbus City Schools in support of their respective food distribution operations.\nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to enter into grant agreements with the Mid-Ohio Foodbank dba Mid-Ohio Food Collective, the Children’s Hunger Alliance, Lifecare Alliance, and Columbus City Schools in support of their respective food distribution operations; to authorize the transfer of $695,000.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the appropriation of funds, including any additional funds, form the unappropriated balance of the Health Special Revenue Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $695,000.00 from Health Special Revenue Fund; to authorize the expenditure of funds on reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses; and to declare an emergency.
