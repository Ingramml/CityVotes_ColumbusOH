    "description": "Explanation\n \nOn March 13, 2023, Columbus City Council voted to prohibit the inquiry and use of salary history information in the job application and interview process through Chapter 2335 of the Columbus City Codes. Since then, City Council has continued to seek out policy solutions that promote economic mobility for families and reduce pay disparities.\n \nThis legislation seeks to amend Chapter 2335 to require pay transparency in job postings. Cleveland City Council passed similar legislation earlier this year. Cincinnati and Toledo also have pay transparency requirements. This legislation will increase uniformity in policies for employers in Ohio, promote best practices in human resources, support job seekers in their search and in pay negotiations, and ensure that Columbus employers are operating competitively in the market by implementing these best practices.\n \nThese amendments also include updated references to Chapter 2331, which was updated in 2024, triggering the need for changes to Chapter 2335.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Chapter 2335 of the Columbus City Codes in order to require pay transparency in job postings; to repeal the existing Chapter 2335.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in March 2023, Columbus City Council voted to prohibit the inquiry and use of salary history information in the job application and interview process through Chapter 2335 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council continues to seek to identify policy solutions that promote economic mobility for families and reduce pay disparities; and\n \nWHEREAS, multiple Ohio cities, including Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Toledo have implemented pay transparency requirements in job postings; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing amendments to Chapter 2335 of the Columbus City Codes that will update references to Chapter 2331 which was amended in 2024 and to require pay transparency in job postings; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That Chapter 2335 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended per the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2.  That existing Chapter 2335 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3. That Section 2335.03(C) of the Columbus City Codes, which requires pay transparency in job postings, shall not be enforced until January 1, 2027.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
