    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to modify a not-for-profit service contract with OARnet/OSU for the VMware software licensing, maintenance, and support services contract. \n \nThe Department of Technology (DoT) uses VMware software to operate virtual servers that run critical applications for enterprise systems such as Accela, CUBS, and 311. Server virtualization is the conversion of one physical server into multiple individual and isolated virtual storage spaces. This industry standard was adopted by DoT in 2009 to reduce the costs of Data Center operations. This also reduces power consumption, cooling requirements, and provides further capabilities for recovery and availability of information systems. \n \nOrdinance 1716-2010 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology to enter a contract with OARnet/OSU for VMware for software licensing, maintenance, and support services. \n \nOrdinance 3005-2023, passed by City Council on November 13, 2023, authorized entering a two-year contract with OARnet/OSU, beginning on April 2, 2024, and ending on April 1, 2026. \n \nMost recently, Ordinance 2987-2024, passed by City Council on November 25, 2024, extended that contract through July 30, 2027, at an additional cost of $596,791.16 to ensure on-going service provisions.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to modify the contract to add funds to pay for additional professional services and software licensing in the amount of $218,292.48.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: \nThe original contract amount:                                   $916,566.52 (PO423161, PO485100, PO505140 Ord. 3005-2023)                          \nModification #1:                                                                                           $596,791.16 (PO505140 Ord. 2987-2024)\nModification #2:                                                                         $218,292.48 (This ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications: $1,731,650.16  \n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nIt was recently determined that additional funding is needed to purchase services required to license the city’s VDI infrastructure, which will enable the virtual desktop environments to function correctly. This modification will provide the necessary licensing to ensure peak functionality, proper maintenance, and support.  \n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThrough the State of Ohio Virtualization Program, OARnet/OSU offers significant discounts on VMware that are not available in the marketplace. As such, it is in the city’s best interests to procure VMware through OARnet/OSU, rather than another procurement process. The pricing offered to the city reflects the agreed upon public sector discounts available to all participants in the State of Ohio Virtualization Program. It is in the best interest of the city to modify this contract.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is based on the prices provided on a quote from the vendor.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: OARnet/OSU\nVendor Account #: 006163\nExpiration date: 6/10/2027\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $218,292.48 is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Fund, Fund 5100.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify an existing contract with OARnet/OSU for VMware software licensing, maintenance, and support, pursuant to Columbus City Codes sections relating to not-for-profit service contracts; and to authorize the expenditure of $218,292.48 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Fund.
