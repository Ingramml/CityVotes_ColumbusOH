    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) is currently preparing project grant agreements for projects awarded 2026 Transit Supportive Infrastructure (TSI) Program grant funds.  The TSI Program is part of the LinkUS Initiative, which is a collaboration between the LinkUS Partners, who are COTA, the City of Columbus, Franklin County, and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC).  Funding for COTA’s TSI program is provided by the COTA sales tax increase that was approved by Franklin County voters in 2024; with the LinkUS Partners agreeing that 27.5% of the future revenues from the new 0.5% increase are to fund the TSI Program.\nThe projects comprising the TSI Program’s five-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and annual Capital Improvement Budget (CIB) were identified and selected by the TSI Technical Working Groups, the TSI Technical Coordinating Committee, and the TSI Leadership Committee.  Once selected by the TSI Committees, the COTA board then reviewed and approved both the CIP and CIB.\nCOTA is now in the process of preparing project grant agreements for projects awarded 2026 TSI Program grant funds.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with COTA or others in connection with the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant for projects that have been selected to received TSI Program funding in 2026.  \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe following is a list of the specific projects selected for TSI Program funding in 2026.\nBikeway - Broad Street Urban Trail - Washington Ave to Alum Creek Trail.  This project, initially identified on the TSI Program’s CIP and CIB as East Broad Capital Trail - East (Washington Ave to Alum Creek Trail), consists of installing separated bike lanes along the south side of Broad Street; resurfacing and restriping Broad Street; providing buffers between the roadway and the proposed path as well as between the proposed path and the sidewalk; replacing signals at Broad and Douglas/17th, Ohio, Champion/Governors, Winner/Wilson, Taylor, and Woodland; and providing protected intersection corners for bicyclists at all signalized intersections.  This project will connect to the Alum Creek Trail to the east, and it will connect to the separated bike lanes planned to the west as part of the Bikeway - Broad Street Urban Trail - Scioto Peninsula to Washington Avenue project.  Total project cost estimate is approximately $37,400,00.  The total TSI funding request is approximately $11,700,000.\nBikeway - Broad St Urban Trail - Scioto Peninsula to Washington Ave.  This TSI project, initially identified on the TSI Program’s CIP and CIB as Capital Trail -  (Broad St from Scioto Peninsula to Washington Ave), consists of a two-way separated bikeway from Belle Street to the eastern limit of the BRT project at Washington Avenue. It will be continued by the Bikeway - Broad Street Urban Trail - Washington Ave to Alum Creek Trail project further east to connect to the Alum Creek Trail.  Total project cost estimate is approximately $17,800,000.  The total TSI funding request is approximately $17,800,000.\nBikeway - West Broad Street BRT Corridor Shared Use Path.  This project, initially identified on the TSI Program’s CIP and CIB as W Broad St, consists of two segments along the West Broad Street Bus Rapid Transit corridor where shared use paths will be funded through the TSI program. The first is from Rockbrook Crossing Avenue/Doherty Road to Westwoods Boulevard/Hilliard Rome Road where shared use path will be along one side. The second is through the I-70 interchange, from approximately Lechner Avenue to Schultz Avenue, where shared use path will be along both sides.  Total project cost estimate is approximately $7,770,000.  The total TSI funding request is approximately $3,000,000.\nRoadway - Trabue Road and Walcutt Road.  This project, initially identified on the TSI Program’s CIP and CIB as Trabue Rd - Renner Rd to Buckeye Yard, will realign the intersection of Trabue Road with Walcutt Drive and construct a shared use path on the south side of Trabue Rd from the intersection of Renner Rd with Rentra Dr to the existing SUP east of Walcutt Dr. Improvements also include the addition of an eastbound right turn lane at the intersection of Renner Rd with Rentra Dr, sidewalk on the north side of Trabue Rd, and pavement resurfacing.  In addition to connecting to the existing shared-use path to the east, this projects shared-use path will also connect to the shared-use path that will be constructed on the south side of Renner Road as part of Columbus’ 538017-100000 Intersection - Hilliard Rome Rd at Renner Rd project.  Total project cost estimate is approximately $17,912,047.  The total TSI funding request is approximately $2,700,000.\nMobility - Nelson Road - Livingston Avenue to Main Street.  This project, initially identified on the TSI Program’s CIP and CIB as Trabue Rd - Renner Rd to Buckeye Yard, will construct a sidewalk along Nelson Road to provide a pedestrian connection between Livingston Avenue and Main Street.  This connection will provide pedestrian access to the East Main Street Bus Rapid Transit Corridor to the north and the Livingston Avenue improvements to the south.  Total project cost estimate is approximately $5,000,000.  The total TSI funding request is approximately $2,500,000.\n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  The expenditure of City funds will be approved in the form of design and/or construction contracts that will be submitted to City Council at a later time. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant and other requisite agreements with the Central Ohio Transit Authority for the acceptance and administration of said grants for projects approved to received 2026 Transit Supportive Infrastructure Program funds; and to authorize expenditure of any awarded fund and the refund of any unused funds.
