Pursuant to Ordinanace 1568-2021, services are to be performed until all work is completed.

Ordinance 1061-2025 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the original contract to provide additional funds for continued development for the Asset Information Management System (AIMS).\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract to add additional funding for $185,000.00 for system hosting, technical support, and continued development of the SaaS solution for the Asset Information Management System. \n \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of work to develop a SaaS (software as a service) solution for the Asset Information Management System (AIMS). \n \n1.1                     Amount of additional funds to be expended: $185,000.00\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $185,000.00.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $650,000.00     (PO281991, Ord. 1568-2021) \nModification No. 1                                                                                                                 $196,820.00     (PO356504, Ord. 2852-2022)\nModification No. 2:                                                                                                 $280,000.00    (PO392337, Ord. 1276-2023)\nModification No. 3:                                                                                                 $185,000.00    (PO509527, Ord. 1061-2025)\nModification No. 4:                                                                                                         $185,000.00    (This Ordinance, Ord. 2810-2025)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $1,496,820.00  \n \n1.2                     Reason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to add additional funds to pay for software maintenance, technical support, and additional software coding related to the Asset Information Management System (AIMS). \n \n1.3                     Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe Asset Information Management System (AIMS) was formally advertised, bids were evaluated, and the proposal from Cultivate Geospatial Solutions, LLC was selected by the committee.
