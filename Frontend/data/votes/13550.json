    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant revocable encroachment easements to Mt Vernon Ave A.M.E. Church to allow a portion of their building and retaining wall (0.005 acres) to remain on City property within existing right-of-way, at 1145-1155 Mt Vernon Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43203 (parcel 010-046584 and 010-040087).  \n \nThe Department of Public service is engaged in the Roadway - Multimodal - Mt Vernon Avenue Phase 1 project.  This project includes roadway improvements to the Martin Luther King Jr/Mount Vernon Avenue corridor from Hamilton Avenue to North Champion Avenue.  Improvements include adding on-street separated bike paths with an added concrete median, floating bus islands at various locations, repaving the full width of the roadway, and sidewalk repairs.\n                                                                                                           \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request that the City grant a Revocable Encroachment Easement to allow a portion of their building and retaining wall (0.005 acres) to remain on City property within existing right-of-way. The existing building and retaining wall were identified to be encroaching into the right-of-way while reviewing the construction plans for the project. The existing building and retaining wall are not impacting any functionality of the right-of-way.  Granting these encroachment easements is needed in order for ODOT and the City of Columbus to clear the right-of-way for this project.  The following ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute documents necessary to grant these encroachment easements for the proposed building into the public right-of-way. \n \nOrdinance 0688-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds for the Operation Safewalks - FRA - SRTS Mt. Vernon Avenue project.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to grant this Revocable Encroachment Easement.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so establishment of the necessary encroachment easements can proceed without delay allowing for acquisition related activities to continue towards clearing right-of-way for this project and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant a Revocable Encroachment Easement to Mt Vernon Ave A.M.E. Church to allow a portion of their building to remain on City property within existing right-of-way; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a Revocable Encroachment Easement in the public rights-of-way was requested by the owner of the property located at 1145-1155 Mt Vernon Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43203; and\n \nWHEREAS, the encroachments include the existing building and retaining wall; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute those documents necessary to grant encroachment easements to Mt Vernon Ave A.M.E.
