    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure correction in the amount of $437,700.00 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 to the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to be applied towards the costs of tree plantings. \n \nIn 2024, the Recreation and Parks Department applied for and was awarded funding through the Urban Forestry Grant Program administered by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Upon award of this grant, the Recreation and Parks Department entered into contract with Ironsite, Inc. for the Street Trees - Fall 2024 Project, per Ordinance 1913-2024. The contract was originally funded by the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 with funds awarded by the ODNR Urban Forestry Grant Program. When this project was nearing completion, a technicality was found in the planting specifications. The planting specifications used in the contract language included wire baskets to cover the root ball when planted. ODNR does not approve the use of wire baskets, so they did not approve of this expense coming from the grant funding, requiring the grant funds be diverted to a future project. Since the grant agreement and related funding does not expire until April of 2028, the Recreation and Parks Department still plans to utilize the ODNR grant funding on future tree planting projects. Forestry staff are working with ODNR to submit a grant revision that will lead to new procurement of tree planting services. Ultimately, these grant funds will be used for future tree planting contracts in 2026 and 2027. \n \nAn expenditure correction to move the existing project’s expenses to an alternate funding source is being requested in this ordinance. Once completed, the grant funding will be made available for the future tree planting contracts. Invoice amounts paid from existing PO465612, in the amount of $437,700.00, will be expenditure corrected and the remaining balance of this purchase order will be cancelled. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nIronsite, Inc.\nPO Box 304\nSunbury, Ohio 43074                                                     \nPeter Isbell, (740) 965-4616                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 005926\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: August 26, 2027\n \nBenefits to the Public: Planting street trees increases the Urban Tree Canopy and this project replaces trees lost due to varying causes of tree mortality. Trees help to reduce storm water runoff, utility costs, air pollution, and heat-island effects in urban areas. \n \nCommunity Input Issues: The majority of the trees being planted as part of this contract have been requested by the property owners.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by planting trees to enhance the city’s overall environmental health.\n \nFiscal Impact: $437,700.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure correction. This ordinance is contingent on the deposit of bond sale proceeds from the 2025 General Obligation Bond Sale for the City of Columbus.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize an expenditure correction of $437,700.00 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund to the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund to be applied towards the costs of tree plantings; and to authorize the expenditure of $437,700.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
