    "title": "To authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with OSS Ohio Holdings, LLC. for security officer services to add additional funding; to authorize a total expenditure of $30,000.00 from the Health Special Revenue Fund for said contract modification; and to declare an emergency.  ($30,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with OSS Ohio Holdings, LLC., for security services at Columbus Public Health, for the period March 1, 2025 to February 28, 2026, to provide additional funding in an amount not to exceed $30,000.00 for a new total contract amount of $530,000.00. This modification is necessary due to increased hours and pay rates of all levels of security officers. (1) the amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: $30,000.00; (2) why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: we estimate a total contract amount to the best of ability, outside factors affect that such as officers at various pay rates, OT costs for events, etc.; (3) why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: OSS Ohio Holdings is our current awarded security vendor, these are not new services, just additional funds needed; and (4) how the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: by bidding documents and security officer payroll costs.\n \n \nThe contract compliance number for OSS Ohio Holdings, LLC., is CC-044219 and is valid through 1/3/2027.  This ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to avoid a break in the delivery of these needed security services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $30,000.00 is budgeted and available within the Health Special Revenue Fund to meet the financial obligation of this contract modification. PO492672 authorizes $500,000.00 for these security services. With this modification, the contract amount will be $530,000.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with OSS Ohio Holdings, LLC. for security officer services to add additional funding; to authorize a total expenditure of $30,000.00 from the Health Special Revenue Fund for said contract modification; and to declare an emergency.  ($30,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a current existing contract for security officer services for the Health Department facility located at 240 Parsons Avenue; and\n \nWHEREAS, a modification to the existing contract is necessary due to increased hours and pay rates of all levels of security officers; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health desires to modify its existing contract with OSS Ohio Holdings, LLC., as an emergency measure in order to avoid a break in these needed security services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual, daily operations of the Department of Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract for security officer services for the Health Department’s 240 Parsons Avenue facility to avoid any delay or break in these needed security services and to utilize current funding available for this modification, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare, and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with OSS Ohio Holdings, LLC., for security officer services for the Health Department facility located at 240 Parsons Avenue for the period March 1, 2025, through February 28, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $30,000.00 is hereby authorized from the Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250, Department of Health, Division No. 5001, in object class 03 - Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance and to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City's financial records.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
