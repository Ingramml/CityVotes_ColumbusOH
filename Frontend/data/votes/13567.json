    "description": "...Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a sanitary easement described and recorded in Instrument Number 202407180071846, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”).

The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed a request by the owner of the Servient Estate to vacate a 0.754 acre, more or less, portion of the existing Easement and determined that the portion of the Easement is no longer needed as a new easement was granted in Instrument Number 202508130086702 and the easement is no longer necessary. DPU has determined that terminating the City’s rights to the portion of the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Not applicable.\n \n...Title\n \nTo authorize the director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release a portion the City’s sanitary easement rights described and recorded in Instrument Number 202407180071846, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
