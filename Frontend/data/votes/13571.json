    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain YSI Parts and Services with Fondriest Environmental Inc  This contract provides parts and services in the remote water quality monitoring network in the source water, as well as the finished drinking water distribution system throughout the City of Columbus service area. The Division of Water is the primary user for these items.  This modification is necessary to allow price increases that exceed the increases currently allowed under the existing terms of the UTC due to fluctuating markets and an increase in the cost of doing business as requested by the vendors.  The contract, PO383085, was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ023803, Ordinance #0726-2023 and will expire May 31, 2026.\nNo additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested.  There is no change in the type of products being procured.  The original contract was formally bid.  The remainder of the original terms and conditions remain in effect. \nPursuant to Section 329.09(a) of Columbus City Codes:\n(1) Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: No additional funding is required to modify the UTC. Agencies ordering from the UTC will secure their funding for its use according to the new price schedule for the UTC.\n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A; not adding goods/services with this modification.\n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: The existing UTC was competitively bid, and price increases are due to market fluctuations and rising costs of doing business. It is important that the ability to order these supplies continues without interruption for the users of this UTC.\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: No additional goods are being added, but manufacturers provided price increases and reasoning for the increases on existing products covered by the UTC.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency because YSI Parts and Services are needed to maintain water quality monitoring service without interruption. The following manufacturer prices increased by the percentage noted due to an increase in the cost of doing business, and a price increase needs to be implemented on the contract immediately to continue orders:\nFondriest Environmental Inc - 22.9%\nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Division of Water must set aside its own funding for its estimated expenditures.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract with Fondriest Environmental Inc. to allow for manufacturer price increases for the option to purchase YSI Parts and Services; and to declare an emergency.
