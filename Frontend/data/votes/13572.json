No. 611038-100001 (“Public Project”).  This project originated from an Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) assessment of the Twin Lake Upper Dam.  The 2016 inspection identified items related to dam safety that needed to be addressed. These items included a hydrologic and hydraulic study to determine the Twin Lakes discharge/storage capacity and associated design implementation, design and installation of an emergency spillway at Twin Lakes Dam, concrete repairs and other ancillary work.\n \nThe City must acquire in good faith and accept certain fee simple and lesser real estate located in the vicinity of Brookwood Road and College Avenue along US 33 at either side of the US-33 embankment (College Ave) (collectively, “Real Estate”) in order for DPU to complete the project.  Accordingly, DPU requested the City Attorney to acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) in order for DPU to timely complete the Public Project.  An exhibit is attached to this Ordinance showing the details of four (4) permanent easements to be acquired for this project.\n \nThe property to be acquired is located in Columbus Community 57, Mid East.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nNot applicable. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $100,000.00 for this expenditure are budgeted, available and appropriated in the Storm Bond Fund, Fund 6204. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to acquire the Real Estate while the property owners are ready to proceed with the transactions so construction can begin on the needed dam safety improvements. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to spend City funds to acquire and accept in good faith certain fee simple and lesser real estate needed to complete the Twin Lake Dam Rehabilitation Project and to contract for associated professional services needed for the acquisition of the real estate; to authorize an expenditure of up to $100,000.00 within the Storm Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
