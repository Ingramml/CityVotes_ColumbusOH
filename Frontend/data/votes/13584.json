    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into an agreement with Columbus FiberNet LLC (CFN) for fiber optic cable maintenance services in the amount of $88,201.27 for the CFN fiber duct system, in support of the City’s fiber optic infrastructure. The original agreement (EL010409 and EL011025) was authorized by Ordinance 1296-2009, passed October 5, 2009, and Ordinance 1327-2010, passed October 4, 2010. These ordinances authorized the City to acquire a portion of the conduit system, known as FiberNet, which at that time consisted of one-point-nine-inch (1.9\") duct with ninety-six (96) strand single mode installed fiber. This ordinance funds year sixteen (16) of a twenty (20) year agreement, authorized by Ordinance 1296-2009. At the time of purchase, maintenance fees were waived for a period of five years. However, starting in 2015 contract terms for scheduled annual maintenance (with an annual maintenance fee) were authorized. These terms are as follows:\n \n“Section 9.1 references: \"Scheduled Maintenance Seller shall use commercially reasonable methods to maintain the property in a secure and good condition. Such routine maintenance (“Scheduled Maintenance”) shall include, but is not limited to, locating and marking the property and pumping, venting, air quality testing, and proofing the property when necessary. Buyer shall pay to Seller for Seller’s services under this Section 9.1, an amount equal to $0.19 (cents) a year per foot of conduit owned by Buyer (the “Maintenance Fee”) for the period commencing 5 years from the closing date and continuing thereafter for a period of 12 months (“Initial Term”). The first 5 years of this contract the fees will be waived. After the Initial Term expires, the Maintenance Fee shall increase annually by the change in CPI. This fee shall continue for so long as Seller is providing Scheduled Maintenance services to Buyer hereunder. Such payments are due up front on the first day of each anniversary of the closing date.\"\n \nThe City owns fiber optic cabling in various strand count quantities throughout the City. The above-described services are needed to regularly inspect and maintain these assets and provide fiber optic cable maintenance services in the event of unforeseen damage to the fiber network. This agreement provides labor, equipment, and materials needed to ensure reliable operation of the City’s fiber network.\n \nThe original agreement was most recently renewed on July 24, 2024, with passage of Ordinance 1904-2024, authorizing the required annual maintenance for the period of October 21, 2024, through October 20, 2025. As the current contract has expired, this ordinance also authorizes a waiver of competitive bidding, in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  Given the extensive and urgent need for the continued fiber optic cable maintenance services, and the established relationship with the vendor, it is in the City’s best interests to utilize bid waiver legislation for this ordinance.\n \nLastly, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $88,201.27 for the above-described purpose.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the above-described services are budgeted and available in the Information Services Operating fund.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation. The current contract expired on October 21, 2025. To ensure a contract is in place as soon as possible, emergency action is necessary.  The City has invested in a large fiber network and owns fiber optic cabling in various strand count quantities throughout the City that need to be regularly inspected and maintained.  These critical services include but are not limited to the locating and marking the property and pumping, venting, air quality testing, and proofing the property when necessary are critical for fiber optic cable maintenance.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nVendor Name: Columbus FiberNet LLC \nVendor Number: 005936\nExpiration Date: 8/20/2026\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter an agreement with Columbus FiberNet LLC for fiber optic cable maintenance services; to authorize the expenditure of $88,201.27 from the Information Services Operating fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
