    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to execute an intergovernmental agreement with the Regional Council of Governments for the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging, and transfer the amount of $6,000,000.00. This transfer is in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 167.06 relating to intergovernmental transfers. The Regional Council of Governments for the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (“COG-COAAA”) is a Regional Council of Governments serving Delaware, Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Licking, Madison, Pickaway, and Union counties.  \nThe mission of Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) is to inform and support people as they navigate the experience of aging or disability. \n \nThis funding will ensure the newly established COG-COAAA can meet payroll, retirement contributions, and insurance coverage obligations for staff who are hired by the Regional Council beginning January 1, 2026. This intergovernmental transfer will enable the Regional Council to operate for two months, thereby preventing any delay in meeting said obligations. \n \nIn addition, the COG-COAAA will operate out of 3776 S. High St with the need to have use of all existing personal property within the building as said property had been previously acquired by COAAA through the acquisition of federal and state grant funding in support of their mission as an AAA.  This property will include but is not limited to office furniture, appliances, fixtures, computer equipment, and copy machines. This ordinance will direct the Director of Recreation and Parks to donate all personal property recorded and attached to this ordinance, to the COG-COAAA and waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes relating to the sale of City owned personal property.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $6,000,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2286 to meet the financial obligations of this transfer. A transfer of appropriation between objects within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund is needed to align appropriation with the proper object\nclasses.\n \nPrincipal Party: \nRegional Council of Governments for the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging \nTamara James, Interim Executive Director\n3776 S High Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43224\nPhone: 614-940-0905\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to execute an intergovernmental agreement with the Regional Council of Governments for the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging, to authorize a transfer of appropriations between objects within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund, to authorize the expenditure of $6,000,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund, and to waive relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes relating to the sale of City owned personal property for donation to the COG-COAAA.
