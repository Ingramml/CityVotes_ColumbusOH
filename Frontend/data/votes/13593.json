    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a grant agreement with the Mid-Ohio Foodbank dba Mid-Ohio Food Collective for the amount not to exceed $10,000.00 for food distribution operations. This funding support is necessary due to the continued threatened cessation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and gaps in that funding.  \nAccording to data from Ohio Jobs and Family Services, approximately 12.8% of households in Columbus receive SNAP benefits. These benefits are crucial to preventing hunger and supporting food security among the City’s residents. Franklin County has 173,523 SNAP beneficiaries obtaining approximately $31 million per month in benefits. Additionally, Columbus City Schools estimates that approximately 29,000 students receive SNAP benefits. For many of these households, SNAP benefits constitute the primary or sole means by which they can afford to purchase food The city recognizes that a TRO was granted on 10.31.25, and anticipates that the benefits to eligible recipients will be made available sometime this month. Due to the gap period, however, the city is requesting continued emergency funding to be able to serve the community during this time. \nThe City’s community partners-including local food pantries-have reported an increase in residents seeking emergency food assistance since the federal government shutdown began in early October\nThe Mid-Ohio Food Collective is a non-profit organization that services twenty counties in Ohio, and is the largest food bank in the state.  Its mission is to end hunger one nourishing meal at a time while co-creating communities where everyone thrives.  \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is requested in order for Mid-Ohio Food Collective to immediately address the food distribution need exacerbated by the federal shutdown and the need to fill the gap as SNAP benefits are loaded.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $10,000.00 from the Health Special Revenue Fund with the Mid-Ohio Food Collective for food distribution operations. \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to enter into a grant agreement with the Mid-Ohio Foodbank dba Mid-Ohio Food Collective; to authorize the expenditure of $10,000.00 from Health Special Revenue Fund; to authorize the expenditure of funds on reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses; and to declare an emergency.
