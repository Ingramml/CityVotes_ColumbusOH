    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement with LifeCare Alliance in support of food distribution operations. This funding support is necessary due to the continued threatened cessation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and gaps in that funding. \nThe Department of Finance and Management receives annual entitlement funding awards for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The purpose of CDBG funds is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low-and moderate-income persons. The delivery of emergency food support operations is an eligible CDBG public service to improve the quality of life of low- to moderate-income residents.\nAccording to the American Community Survey’s 2023 5-year estimates, more than 34,000 families in Columbus receive SNAP benefits; approximately 12.8% of all households. These benefits are crucial to preventing hunger and supporting food security among the City’s residents. For many of these households, SNAP benefits constitute the primary or sole means by which they can afford to purchase food. The suspension of SNAP benefits will have immediate and severe consequences for Columbus and its residents. When those benefits are suspended, the burden of meeting basic nutritional needs falls to local government and nonprofit service providers that already operate at capacity. While the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services has indicated they will begin issuing SNAP benefits as early as November 19th, federal guidance has reduced the amount families will receive to 65% or less than their normal benefit. Due to the delay in payment distribution and reduced payment amounts the City is requesting emergency funding to be able to serve the community during this time. \nOrdinance 3013-2025 authorized the expenditure of $695,000 to support food distribution operations of four local partner agencies. The addition of $40,000 in CDBG funds will reinforce support for the City’s community partners to address Columbus residents’ increased need for food assistance resulting from the recent federal government shutdown.\nLifeCare Alliance is a nonprofit human services organization that provides a comprehensive array of health and nutrition services to residents of central Ohio. LifeCare Alliance’s mission is to lead our community in identifying and delivering health and nutrition services to meet the community’s changing needs.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists within the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a subrecipient agreement with LifeCare Alliance and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $40,000 from Fund 2248 in order for the City’s community partners to immediately address critical food distribution needs exacerbated by both the federal government shutdown and the delayed delivery and reduced amount of SNAP benefits.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $40,000.00 in FY 2024 CDBG funds awarded to the City by HUD from Fund 2248.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement with LifeCare Alliance in support of their respective food distribution operations, in the cumulative amount of $40,000.00; to authorize the appropriation and the expenditure of $40,000.00; and to declare an emergency.  ($40,000.00) \nBody\nWHEREAS, there is need to provide support and resources to our community partners, which will be facing greater need as the federal shutdown affects food assistance programs such as SNAP and WIC; and\nWHEREAS, LifeCare Alliance is a nonprofit human services organization that provides a comprehensive array of health and nutrition services to residents of central Ohio; and\nWHEREAS, Mayor Ginther is proposing support of $40,000.00 (collectively) in support of their food distribution needs; and \nWHEREAS, $40,000.00 of FY 2024 CDBG funds are available within Fund 2248 for this purpose; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is necessary to enter into subrecipient agreement immediately with LifeCare Alliance in support of their respective food distribution operations to address the food distribution needs exacerbated by the federal shutdown and the cessation of SNAP benefits, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement with LifeCare Alliance in support of their respective food distribution operations, in the amounts described below:\nLifeCare Alliance: $40,000.00\nSECTION 2.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\nSECTION 7.
