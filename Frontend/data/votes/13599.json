    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:                     \n \nThis Ordinance is submitted to settle the pre-litigation matter brought by Luis Escobedo Villanueva for the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($75,000). \nThe pre-litigation matter was brought through counsel by Luis Escobedo Villanueva who, on September 16, 2024, was detained in a traffic stop, arrested on warrant for someone else, spent two and half days in jail, and had felony charges filed against him based on the warrant for someone else.  On September 16, 2024, Columbus police officers responded to a report of 50-60 vehicles doing burnouts in a parking lot.  Villanueva was stopped for an equipment violation.  Officers ran Villanueva’s information through the computer systems and a warrant alert populated.  Records technicians reached out to the issuing agency in Indiana and the warrant was confirmed.  Subsequently, Villanueva was arrested on the warrant, taken through ID and booked into jail.  \nTo initiate the extradition to Indiana, a Columbus detective filed a criminal complaint for Fugitive from Justice, a felony charge.  The detective also requested a high bond. Villanueva was able to post bond on September 19 and the felony charge was dismissed by prosecutors on September 25.      \nThe warrant from Indiana was for a man with the same first name and same date of birth.  However, the wanted man had a different surname, lived in Indiana, was shorter, and weighed less.  This ordinance would allow settlement and resolution of all claims relating to the September 16, 2024 arrest. \nFiscal Impact:                       \nThis ordinance authorizes the settlement of a pre-litigation matter.  Funds were not specifically budgeted for this settlement; however, sufficient monies are available within the Department of Finance’s Citywide Account for this purpose.\n \nEmergency action is requested for this ordinance to be effective immediately in order for the parties to effectuate the settlement of the pre-litigation matter brought by Luis Escobedo Villanueva, which is the best interest of the City, and to pay the agreed to sum without delay thereby mitigating any potential claim of further liability.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Attorney to settle the claims of Luis Escobedo Villanueva; to authorize the expenditure of the sum of Seventy-Five Thousand and No Cents ($75,000.00) in settlement of the matter; and to declare an emergency. ($75,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Luis Escobedo Villanueva alleges that his constitutional rights were violated on or about September 16, 2024, when Columbus police officers arrested him on a warrant for another person and then initiated felony charges against him; and   \n \nWHEREAS, a settlement in the amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($75,000.00), to be paid by the City and to include attorneys’ fees and court costs, was deemed to be acceptable in exchange for a release from Villanueva of any claims against the City of Columbus and any of its employees, agents, officials; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, in that it is necessary for this ordinance to be effective immediately in order for the parties to effectuate the settlement of these claims in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement, which is in the best interest of the City, and to pay the agreed to sum without delay; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
