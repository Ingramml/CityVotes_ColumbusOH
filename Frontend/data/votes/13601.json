    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract (FEM Project No. 1505.4.) with Cornerstone Maintenance Services, Ltd. for heating ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC), and air purification maintenance services at various facilities within the Department of Public Utilities (DPU).\nThe work to be performed under this contract modification concerns HVAC & air purification units and their associated equipment and systems that require inspection, sampling, testing, troubleshooting, balancing, maintenance, and repair or replacement. This includes maintenance and repair of piping and ductwork. The work may also include software updates for the various HVAC units or any HVAC associated equipment.\nThis equipment helps ensure required environmental conditions are met in areas housing sensitive electronics crucial to monitoring, operating, and controlling many plant processes and equipment. Regular inspection and maintenance of HVAC and air purification equipment help ensure the equipment operates safely throughout its expected life.\nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids in accordance with Chapter 329 of City Code via RFSQ022406. Two (2) bids were received and opened on August 17, 2022. The Division of Water Reclamation recommended an award be made to Cornerstone Maintenance Services, Ltd., which was deemed the lowest, responsive, responsible, and best bidder. The contract was initially bid as a one (1) year contract with an option for four (4) additional years contingent on consensus of the City and the Contractor and approval of City Council. The original contract was authorized pursuant to Ordinance No. 2415-2022. The first renewal of this contract was ORD 2344-2023, and was passed on 9/18/2023. The second renewal of this contract was ORD 1873-2024 and was passed on 7/22/2024. The contract end on October 31, 2025 before a renewal could be passed by City Council. Thus a bid waiver and a new contract is being requested for one year with an option of an additional one year renewal.
