    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Performance Pipelining, Inc., for public sanitary sewers for the Blueprint Hilltop 1 - Palmetto/Westgate Lateral Lining Project 2 project, CIP #650872-153002, in an amount up to $8,273,325.55; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction administration and inspection services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $8,275,325.55. \n \nThis project is a Consent Order project. A Consent order is a negotiated agreement entered as a court order that is enforceable by the court. In 2005, the City of Columbus submitted its Wet Weather Management Plan to the Ohio EPA to bring the City in compliance with consent orders regarding the City’s sewer overflows. This project is an improvement identified in the Integrated Plan and in the 2015 Wet Weather Management Plan Update Report.  \n \nThe work will include cleaning, televising, and lining sewer lateral lines in the Hilltop neighborhood (specifically in the Palmetto/Westgate sub-area).  A sewer lateral line is an underground pipe, typically 4 to 6 inches in diameter that connects a private property’s plumbing system to the main public sanitary sewer line in the street.  This work is needed to mitigate water in basement events and sanitary sewer overflows to the goal of a 10-year Level of Service (LOS).  Over time, sewer lateral lines can develop cracks and leaks, allowing rainwater to get into the City’s sanitary sewers.  The sanitary sewer system was not meant to hold rainwater, so when rainwater does get in, the pipes fill beyond their capacity. This overwhelms the system, potentially leading to sewage overflowing into rivers or backing up into basements. Lateral lining of sewer lateral lines places a resin-filled liner in the pipe, which is then hardened by filling it with hot water.  This hardened liner then replaces the old pipe and prevents rainwater from entering the sanitary sewer system.\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 53, Greater Hilltop.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 540 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.  Work will continue until the project is completed and accepted by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT: The bid amount and proposed contract award amount is $8,273,325.55, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                       $8,273,325.55\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                      $0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                                $2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                               $8,275,325.55\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project is part of the 2015 Integrated Plan to address wet weather overflows from the sanitary sewer system.  This project will complete 1 of the 4 pillars for the Palmetto/Westgate neighborhood within the Hilltop, by rehabilitating the existing sanitary sewer laterals to prevent infiltration and inflow into the sanitary system from rainwater.  There have been multiple public meetings with the neighborhood association over the past 2 years during the progress of the other work in the area.\n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Public Sanitary Sewers for Blueprint Hilltop 1 - Palmetto/Westgate Lateral Lining Project 2 project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 7/31/25 through 8/27/25.  Two bids were received for the project and were opened on 8/27/25.  The following companies submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                           Bid Amount                        Compliance Number          ODI Status\n1.
