    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with BEC Enterprises LLC II, for the purchase and delivery of a water flusher truck for the Division of Water Reclamation, in an amount not to exceed $325,353.00. \n \nThe water flusher truck will be used by the compost facility to control dust around the plant. This purchase is approved by the Division of Fleet Management and will replace BT21935.\n \nProcurement\nThe Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Codes Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding, RFQ030898. Four hundred seventy one (471) vendors were solicited and two (2) bids were received. The bids were opened and evaluated on August 28, 2025. The Division of Water Reclamation has determined the lowest bidder, BEC Enterprises LLC II, be awarded as they were the most responsive, responsible, and best bidder. \n \nAfter the bids were evaluated, it was determined that the low bidder’s quote attachment had an expiration date on it that would not allow proper time for the City’s processing. The second low bidder was evaluated and it was determined they were non-responsive, as the vendor could not provide the requested equipment. Therefore, a bid waiver is being requested to allow the acceptance of the original low bid with an updated quote that extends the expiration date. \n \nPrinicpal Parties:\nBEC Enterprises LLC II \n2501 S.
