    "title": "To amend Chapter 2509 of the Columbus City Codes to enact Section 2509.11 to establish the requirement for an emergency power supply when an electric motor-driven fire pump is installed within a structure. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation:\n \nThis ordinance establishes a proactive fire protection measure to ensure an electric motor-driven fire pump has an emergency power supply in the event the primary electrical supply fails. The emergency power supply ensures the electric motor-driven fire pump continues to operate in the event of an interruption in electrical power during a fire. This code is needed to ensure a reliable supply of electric power for electric motor-driven fire pumps for multi-story, wood frame residential structures in the event the primary source of electricity fails. Fire pumps increase water pressure and flow from municipal water sources or water tanks to a fire suppression system, such as sprinklers, to ensure the system effectively suppresses the fire.  As water travels higher within a building and as sprinkler heads flow water during a fire, the water pressure within the system decreases. When the pressure decreases, the effectiveness of the fire suppression system decreases. An effective and properly functioning fire suppression system prevents the fire from spreading within a building. When the fire suppression system stops the spread of fire, the system provides additional time for occupants to escape a building and creates time for fire fighters to enter a structure, rescue and assist occupant evacuation, and complete extinguishing the fire. An electric motor-driven fire pump generally relies on the building’s electrical power to function. If the electrical power ceases-because of a general power outage or the fire interrupts power-then the fire pump no longer can maintain the necessary water pressure and flow for the fire suppression system to function.  \n \nFiscal Impact:\n \nThere is no immediate fiscal impact to the City.\n \nTitle:\n \nTo amend Chapter 2509 of the Columbus City Codes to enact Section 2509.11 to establish the requirement for an emergency power supply when an electric motor-driven fire pump is installed within a structure. ($0.00)\n \nBody:\n \nWHEREAS, a mission of the Division of Fire is to serve the community by preventing fires through education and inspection and to minimize injury, death, and property destruction due to fire; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Fire has identified a fire prevention need to ensure that fire suppression systems properly function in the event of a power failure at a building; and\n \nWHEREAS, the addition of Section 2509.11 is necessary to fulfill the Division of Fire’s mission by requiring an emergency power supply when an electric motor-driven fire pump is installed within a building; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to add Section 2509.11 of the Columbus City Codes; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1. That Section 2509.11 of Chapter 2509 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby enacted as follows:  \n \nSEE ATTACHMENT\n \nSection 2. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
