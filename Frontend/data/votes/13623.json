    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the professional architectural / engineering services agreement, with Abbot Studios Architects, for the Department of Public Service’s Marion Road Outpost Replacement project, in an amount up to $350,519.75. \n \nThe original contract provided design services for the demolition and design of a new facility at the Marion Road Outpost.\n \nModification No. 1 (current) is needed to update drawings that were held for two years due to lack of funding.\n \n2. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.  The amt of additional funds to be expended under the modification:  $350,519.75\n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $720,951.25  (PO306486/PO498518)\nModification No. 1 (current):                     $350,519.75\nTotal (Original and Mod 1):                     $1,070,951.25\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nFunding for construction was unavailable and the project was put on hold for approximately two years.  Funding is now available and the preconstruction phase needs to be restarted.\n \nC.  Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\nThere is no need to use another procurement process as the City already awarded the design contract to Abbot Studios Architects.  Their drawings need updated for site compliance review and approval by the Building and Zoning Department.\n \nD.  How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nThe contractor submitted a fee proposal and was accepted by the Dept. of Finance & Management, Office of Construction Management as well as the Department of Public Service.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: Abbot Studios Architects, Vendor No. 004796, expires 10/17/27, Majority-designated\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Abbot Studios Architects.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency legislation is requested to immediately restart design services to expedite the preconstruction phase.  A spring 2026 construction start date is needed to receive salt deliveries prior to fall 2027.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes a transfer of $268,393.71 and an expenditure up to $350,519.75 and was budgeted within the Street Construction Maintenance & Repair Operating Fund.   \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the professional architectural / engineering services agreement with Abbot Studios Architects, for the Department of Public Service’s Marion Road Outpost Replacement project; to authorize a transfer of $268,393.71 within the Street Construction Maintenance & Repair Operating Fund; to authorize an expenditure up to $350,519.75 within the Street Construction Maintenance & Repair Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
