    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to reserve and encumber 2025 budgeted funds in the amount of $349,600.00 for software maintenance, licensing, and support contracts that renew in the first quarter of 2026. The Department of Technology (DoT) maintains ongoing contracts that provide essential services related to software systems, user support, and technology maintenance to ensure continued functionality of critical City operations across departments. These include contracts with Core Technology Corp (007566), Aciss Systems, Inc. (009561), MCM Technology, LLC (000391), Cornerstone OnDemand (000683), Brown Enterprise Solutions (010668), Avanade Inc. (044500), Ohio State University (005303), DataWorks Plus, LLC (009425), Articulate Global, Inc. (024244), and others. While this ordinance authorizes the encumbrance of funds for these agreements, the contracts themselves do not require legislation, as none individually exceed $50,000.00. \nAdditionally, this ordinance authorizes the Department of Technology to encumber $50,000.00 from its supply budget for unforeseen technology supply needs that may arise during the first quarter of 2026. To avoid interruption in vital technology services, DoT seeks authority to encumber 2025 funds prior to the fiscal year-end close, allowing the City to meet financial obligations and maintain uninterrupted service delivery during the first quarter of 2026.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $399,600.00 is available and budgeted in the Department of Technology, Information Services Fund and the Department of Public Safety, General Fund. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency measure to ensure that there is no interruption in critical technology operations, including software maintenance, user support, and licensing services necessary for the City’s core business systems. Immediate passage will allow the Department of Technology to reserve and encumber 2025 funds in time to meet financial obligations for contracts renewing in the first quarter of 2026, and to encumber DoT’s supply budget for unforeseen technology supply needs in the first quarter of 2026.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to reserve and encumber 2025 funds from the Information Services Fund and the General Fund in the amount of $349,600.00 for various software maintenance, licensing, and support contracts renewing in the first quarter of 2026; to authorize the encumbrance of $50,000.00 from the Information Services Fund for unforeseen technology supply needs in the first quarter of 2026; and to declare an emergency. ($399,600.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Technology maintains ongoing contracts for software maintenance, licensing, and support that are essential to City operations and whose terms renew in the first quarter of 2026; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to reserve and encumber 2025 operating funds prior to year-end close to ensure timely payment and avoid service disruption; and \nWHEREAS, the total estimated cost of the contracts covered by this ordinance is $349,600.00; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the encumbrance of 2025 funds for use in the first quarter of 2026 to ensure continuity of technology services vital to City operations and to provide for unforeseen technology supply needs in the first quarter of 2026, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Technology be and is hereby authorized to reserve and encumber a total of $399,600.00 in 2025 budgeted funds for the contractual obligations for various software maintenance, licensing, and support, and for unforeseen technology supply needs in the first quarter of 2026.\nSECTION 2. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance shall be encumbered from the Department of Technology’s 2025 Information Services Fund budget and the Department of Public Safety’s General Fund budget as approved by the City Auditor. \nSECTION 3.
