    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreement with the not-for-profit agency Heart of Job Foundation. \nThe mission of Heart of Job Foundation (HOJ) is to provide STEAM and Career Technical Education through workforce development programs that lead to family-sustaining careers.  HOJ is seeking grant funding for a year-long partnership with Columbus City Preparatory School for Boys that integrates social-emotional growth, wellness, and career exploration into the middle school experience. Through weekly programming, biannual resource distribution, and a culminating Field Day celebration, the initiative will strengthen student resilience, foster community engagement, and expand career readiness opportunities in alignment with HOJ’s mission.  Existing city employees lack the skills necessary to provide the programming to be offered.  While the grant at issue will support male youths, the overall mission of the Foundation is to support arts communication and media education for all youths.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $12,500.00 from the General Fund.\nContract Compliance: Heart of Job Foundation CC-041659, exp. 4/23/2026\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with Heart of Job Foundation, a not-for-profit organization in support of a year-long partnership with Columbus City Preparatory School for Boys and to authorize the expenditure from the General Fund for programming.
