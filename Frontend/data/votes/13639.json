    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreement with not-for-profit corporation, EPIC Youth.  EPIC Youth is a mentoring and empowerment organization dedicated to equipping young people with the leadership, academic, and professional skills they need to succeed. Through mentorship, hands-on learning experiences, and dynamic programs, EPIC Youth empowers students to build confidence, develop strong character, and prepare for their future careers. \nEPIC Youth is seeking grant funds to partner with Grades Plus Game (G2), a non-profit corporation, to extend their reach from in-school programming into after-school engagement through the EPIC Youth Boys of ICE x Grades + Games School Program.  G2 is an innovative math and science program that integrates academics with physical activity through sports and cooperative games empowering students to excel academically while developing athletic potential, celebrating both academic growth and personal improvement.  The combination of EPIC Youth’s in-school mentoring and leadership development with G2’s after-school academic and athletic programming, can create a full-circle model that motivates students to meet academic and behavior goals.\nThe services cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide. \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of  $12,500.00 from the General Fund.\nContract Compliance: Epic Youth CC-042295 exp. 4/16/2027\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with not-for-profit agency EPIC Youth in support of Boys of ICE x Grades + Games School Program; to authorize the expenditure from the General Fund for programming.
