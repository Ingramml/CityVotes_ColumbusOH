    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for the construction contract with The Righter Company, Inc., for the Greenlawn Dam Rehabilitation Project, CIP #611038-100002, in an amount up to $493,650.00.\n \nThis project originated from an Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) assessment of the Greenlawn Dam.  Improvements to the low-head dam will protect the existing utility infrastructure.  Based on the 2016 ODNR report, the Greenlawn Low Head Dam needs concrete and structural repairs.  Ordinance 0437-2025, passed by City Council on 3/24/25, authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with  The Righter Company, Inc., to perform concrete and structural repairs to the Greenlawn Low Head Dam. Damage to the dam was more extensive than known and could not have been found until work began due to the hidden nature of the damage, requiring a change in the construction method.  A revised construction method is needed to properly perform the work. These changes will also ultimately require an extension of the cofferdam control.  The cost of the change in construction method and the unplanned cost to extend the cofferdam control exceeds the available project contingency funding.  Work cannot be completed without additional funding.  \n \nPlanning Area 54-Franklinton and 55-Downtown\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $493,650.00\nOriginal Contract                                                                                    $ 2,961,978.00 (PO505778, ORD 0437-2025)\nContract Modification #1                                                               $    493,650.00 (Current)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                     $ 3,455,628.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used  \nThis is a contract modification to add funding for unanticipated costs due to damage to the dam being more extensive than known.  The Righter Co. was the lowest, responsive bidder; therefore another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined\nThe cost of the modification was determined based upon existing bid item costs and allowable expenses, with negotiation for needed additional line items.\n \n1.4. Timeline\nThere is no change in the estimated timeline at this time.  The contract started in May 2025 and is estimated to end in 2026.   \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis project originated from an ODNR assessment of Greenlawn Dam. These project improvements to the low-head dam will protect the existing utility infrastructure.  Based on the 2016 ODNR report, the Greenlawn Low Head Dam needs concrete and structural repairs. Improvements will include repairs to the abutments, structures, and other concrete surfaces.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nThe Righter Co., Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004433 and expires 10/3/27.   \n \nAs part of their proposal, The Righter Co. Inc has proposed the following six subcontractors to perform contract work:\nCompany Name                                                                                     City/State                                            ODI Certification Status\nState-Wide Concrete Pumping, Inc                                           Columbus, Ohio                                           MBE\nA2B Concrete Construction LLC                                           Columbus, Ohio                                           MBE\nFollow the River Design                                                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                           EBE\nM.
