    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing contract with Specialized Elevator Corp for elevator maintenance services for the Division of Water Reclamation (DOWR). The contract modification includes extending the contract for an additional year, from February 22, 2026, to February 21, 2027. The modification also covers the funding necessary for the elevator maintenance services during the extended period.\nORD 3347-2022 authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract the contract for elevator maintenance services for the Division of Water Reclamation . ORD 2343-2023 modified the contract to extend the term and add funding, ORD 0271-2024 modified the contract to extend the term without adding additional funding, and finally ORD 2890-2024 added additional funding and extended the term of the contract through February 21, 2026. In May 2025 the contract’s original vendor (Gable Elevators) was purchased by Specialized Elevator Corp. Due to this change, this legislation also authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify past outstanding, present, and future contracts and purchase orders with Gable Elevator and authorizes the assignment of all past outstanding, present, and future business done by the City of Columbus from Gable Elevator to Specialized Elevator Corp.  \nThe contract modification will continue to provide elevator maintenance services for DOWR facilities, including the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant, Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant, and Sewer Maintenance Operations Center Facility. The scope of work includes inspection, testing, troubleshooting, maintenance, repair or replacement of failed components, and software updates for the elevators and associated equipment.\nThe economic impact of the contract modification lies in ensuring the proper functioning of the elevators, which aids in the operation of plant processes and equipment, ensuring the safety of personnel, and avoiding budget impacts due to equipment failure. There are no community outreach or environmental factors considered for this project. \n \n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for the contract is $69,000.00.  Total contract amount including this modification is $381,601.52.\n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen: Funding is added on an incremental basis to provide for services. The need for additional funds were included in the initial contract.\n3.

How cost was determined: A cost proposal was provided by Gable Elevator in their bids and was reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \nSpecialized Elevator Corp D365 Vendor #053208 | Expires 7/23/2027 | Specialized Elevator Corp does not hold MBE/FBE status.\nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n$69,000.00 was budgeted for elevator maintenance services.\n$43,570.98 has been spent so far in 2025 as of 10/16/2025 \n$52,297.74 was spent in 2024 \n$36,789.54 was spent in 2023\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing contract with Specialized Elevator Corp for elevator maintenance services at various Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water Reclamation facilities; to authorize the expenditure of $69,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund, to extend the term for an additional year, and to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify past outstanding, present, and future contracts and purchase orders with Gable Elevator and to authorize the assignment of all past outstanding, present, and future business done by the City of Columbus from Gable Elevator to Specialized Elevator Corp.
