    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the City Attorney to modify the contract with the law firm McNees Wallace & Nurick LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, for energy consultant legal services relating to the City’s purchase of electric power for the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Division of Power (DOP). \n \nDOP needs supply-side electric energy procurement management and advisory services. This firm will work closely with the City Attorney’s Office and the Division of Power to assist the City in identifying energy related issues, identifying the most competitive solutions, and securing the best prices, terms and conditions available for electricity contract(s) with qualified suppliers.  \n \nThe Division of Power is a full service electric utility serving residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The Division currently has approximately 19,190 customer accounts, which include electric service to several City buildings and facilities, such as the City’s water and wastewater treatment plants. The Division also provides electricity services for the city’s street lights, of which there are approximately 57,000 city-wide. In 2024, Division of Power’s customers consumed approximately 902,331 MWh.\n \nThe Division regularly solicits competitive proposals through a Request for Proposals process for a power supply agreement. Currently, the Division has a power supply agreement with American Municipal Power (”AMP”) to supply power through December 31, 2025. The Division will be engaging American Electric Power Energy Partners (“AEPEP”) to supply power in the future, effective January 1, 2026. DPU needs energy consultant legal services to assist with contracting for the purchase of wholesale electric power for this transition and beyond.\n \nThe City Attorney’s Office, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities, solicited proposals for the subject services in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code (RFQ013226).
