    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Evans Mechwart Hambleton & Tilton Inc. (EMH&T Inc.), for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2020-2022 contract in an amount up to $167,230.50.  The construction project to be administered by EMH&T Inc., under this contract modification is the Lateral Lining - Blueprint North Linden 1, Artane Parkwood, CIP No. 650872-141002.\n \nEMH&T was one of six companies selected through the City’s RFP process to perform construction administration/inspection (CA/CI) services for Department of Public Utilities Capital Improvement Projects that bid during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.  While no new capital improvement projects can be added to the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2020-2022 contract, the contract does allow for a modification to add funding, if needed, for continuation of CA/CI services until project completion for projects that began before the end of 2022.  \n \nEMH&T was assigned CA/CI services for the Lateral Lining - Blueprint North Linden 1, Artane Parkwood project after approval by City Council via Ordinance 2749-2025 on 12/13/21.  This project rehabilitated approximately 500 private sanitary sewer service laterals via cured-in-place pipe (CIPP) lining technology to eliminate infiltration, thereby decreasing the number/volume of overflows within the sewer system.  This project is part of the Wet Weather Integrated Plan in response to a consent order issued by the Ohio EPA.  This contract modification is needed to fund final CA/CI services as the construction of this project ends. \nThe Columbus Community is 40-North Linden.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE\nThe original contract allowed for work is to be completed within the timeframe established by the individual construction contracts.  This contract modification will be in effect through the completion of construction for this project.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $167,230.50\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $521,938.79                     PO216078 & PO216128\nModification 1                                                               $340,200.00                     PO222768 & PO222770\nModification 2                                                               $265,476.00                     PO231230\nModification 3                                                               $144,797.71                     PO232017\nModification 4                                                               $638,637.08                     PO241546\nModification 5                                                               $1,220,302.58                     PO254832, PO254835, PO254836, PO254837\nModification 6                                                               $310,500.93                     PO273172\nModification 7                                                               $279,013.79                     PO277870 \nModification 8                                                               $566,857.66                     PO288541\nModification 9                                                               $646,062.67                     PO299464, PO299468\nModification 10                                                    $1,052,396.86      PO308115, PO308136\nModification 11                                                      $188,584.80      PO306158\nModification 12                     A                     $316,006.89                     PO314904\nModification 12                     B                      $549,832.21                     PO313644\nModification 13                                        $528,580.36      PO361024\nModification 14 (current)                     $167,230.50      PO TBD\n \n                              Total:                     $ 7,736,418.83\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2020 - 2022 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 0360-2020.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide Construction Administration/Construction Inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three-year (2020-2022) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.    \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between EMH&T Inc. and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2.
