    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a planned modification to add funding in 2025 for installation, repair and maintenance of commercial fencing, gate & gate controllers with The Paul Peterson Co., Safety Division, Inc. in the amount of $220,000.00 (which includes a 10% contingency). This contract is used to install, repair and maintain new and existing fencing, gates and controllers in and around the Department of Public Utilities locations to maintain security. \n \nThe proposed fencing and gate installation would occur at the following location(s): Spring Street Power Sub Station (adjacent to the Municipal Light Building and Crew Stadium, located in downtown Columbus). This legislation represents phase one (1) of a planned two (2) phase project at this location with phase one (1) expected to be completed within the 2025 budget year, while phase two (2) was submitted to be included in the 2026 Division of Power annual budget and is not included in this legislation request at this time. Phase one (1) work at this site will encompass the installation of climb-proof, cut-proof fencing to protect existing equipment at this location from vandalism and ensure the safety of the public.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids for Installation, Maintenance and Repair of Commercial Fencing, Gate & Gate Controllers in accordance with the relevant provisions of Section 329 (RFQ028373). Two hundred and sixty-nine (269) vendors (1 MBE/VBE, 2 MBE/WBE, 4 WBE, 16 MBE, 15 EBE and 231 MAJ) were solicited. One (MAJ) bid was received and opened on March 9, 2022. \n \nThe bid from The Paul Peterson Co., Safety Division, Inc. was the only bidder and met all the specifications.\n \nCONTRACT AMOUNTS / TIMELINE\nThe contract term is from the date of execution up to and including August 31, 2026. The contract language allowed for one (1) year renewal options based upon mutual agreement, availability of funds, and approval by Columbus City Council. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that require additional funding, a modification would be requested.  \n \nThis contract is funded on a yearly basis, and this legislation seeks to modify the contract to add additional funding for 2025. This Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications. \n \nCost summary:\nOriginal Contract, Ordinance #0754-2023                              $190,000.00\nModification #1, Ordinance #0421-2024                                                                 $91,000.00\nModification #2, Ordinance #0317-2025                                 $77,000.00\nModification #3, Ordinance # (Pending)                                $220,000.00 (which includes a 10% contingency amount)\nEstimated Contract Total:                                                    $578,000.00\n \n1.

Reasons additional funds were not foreseen: The contract is funded on a yearly basis based upon available funding, mutual agreement by both parties, approval by Ordinance of Columbus City Council and the appropriation and certification of funds by the City Auditor. This funding is necessary to provide for the payment of services for Phase one (1) of the planned project at this site which should be concluded within the 2025 budget year.\n \n3.

However, these budgeted funds currently reside within object class 06 (Capital Outlay) and need transferred to object class 03 (Purchased Services) as the fencing to be installed is already owned by the city and we are strictly paying for installation services of said fencing. $220,000.00 will be transferred from object class 06 to object class 03 within the Electricity Operating Fund to support these requested expenses. There is sufficient budget authority available in the 2025 Electricity Operating Fund's Budget to fund the transfer.\n \n$122,566.12 was spent YTD in 2025 (as of 10.28.25)\n$80,372.19 was spent in 2024\n$22,748.38 was spent in 2023\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify the contract with The Paul Peterson Co., Safety Division, Inc.to add additional funding in the amount of $220,000.00 for Installation, Maintenance and Repair of Commercial Fencing, Gate & Gate Controllers; to authorize the transfer of $220,000.00 between object classes in the Electricity Operating Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $220,000.00 from the Electricity Operating Fund.
