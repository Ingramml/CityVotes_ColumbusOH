BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with DLZ Ohio, Inc., for construction administration/inspection services as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract.  \n \nDLZ Ohio, Inc. was awarded a contract to perform construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities Capital Improvement Projects that bid during the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.  The contract is modified as needed throughout the three-year contract period to include projects as they go to construction.  The construction project to be administered by DLZ Ohio, Inc. under this contract modification is the Smart Lighting Phase 2 project, CIP No. 670878-100002, in the amount of $374,667.63. \nThis project will implement LED street light conversions in the Phase 2 project area in the southside neighborhood generally bounded by High Street on the west, Livingston Avenue on the north, Alum Creek Drive to the east and Marion Road to the south.  The project will replace approximately 3,900 existing HPS lights with LED lights.\nThe Columbus Community is 63 - South Side.\n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended: $374,667.63\nOriginal Contract:                                             $775,135.69 (ORD 1768-2023, PO402691, PO402695)\nModification #1:                                                               $1,191,867.05 (ORD 2111-2023, PO411979)\nModification #2:                                                               $1,822,179.64 (ORD 2942-2023, PO425120)\nModification #3:                                                                 $129,591.25 (ORD 3300-2023, PO431695)\nModification #4:                                                                 $634,598.83 (ORD 0523-2024, PO447156 and PO447158)\nModification #5:                                                                 $133,297.64 (ORD 2556-2024, PO484303) \nModification #6:                                                                   $73,325.27 (ORD 3004-2024, PO487373)\nModification #7:                                               $99,644.31 (ORD 3552-2024, PO496559)\nModification #8:                                                                 $125,572.91 (ORD 2185-2025)\nModification #9:                                                                 $159,356.54 (ORD 2281-2025, PO53758)\nModification #10:                                          $1,558,922.99 (ORD 2671-2025)\nModification #11:                                            $374,667.63 (ORD 3029-2025)\n \nTotal                                                                                     $7,078,159.75\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 1768-2023.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three-year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.  \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by DLZ, Ohio, Inc., reviewed by the project team, and was deemed acceptable.  The fees in the proposal are based upon contract pricing already established for job titles, tasks, and allowable expenses for the contract.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe installation and conversion to LED lighting within the project area will provide both an additional sense of safety and security to the residents.  This may also deter criminal activity which lessens the financial impact on City resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  The Division of Power will have significant energy savings from the conversion to LED from high pressure sodium street lights. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nDLZ Ohio, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004939 and expires 7/22/2026.  \n \nDLZ Ohio, Inc. proposed no subcontractors to use for this project.\nThe certification of DLZ Ohio, Inc.’s was in good in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for project #670878-100002 in Fund 6303 (Electricity Bond Fund) is budgeted, available, and appropriated. \n \n5.
