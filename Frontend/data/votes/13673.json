    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the City Clerk to report to the Auditors of Franklin County, Ohio, all charges which are due to the City of Columbus, Department of Building & Zoning Services, and are certified for payment to said County Auditor in conformance with Sections 701.07 through 701.19 of the Columbus City Code for weed and solid waste removal. In the assessment period covered by this legislation (May 1st, 2025 through October 31st, 2025), owners of 518 properties within Columbus were notified to abate weed and solid waste nuisances. Those properties where violations were not abated were turned over to the Environmental Nuisance Weed and Solid Waste Program for compliance. Abatement was completed using the services of private and/or City contractors. This legislation provides for assessment of the costs associated with the weed and solid waste abatement process.\n \nEMERGENCY: Emergency action is required to best preserve the ability to assess these costs to the tax duplicate prior to property transfer due to sheriff's sale.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation provides a mechanism for recovery of costs associated with the weed and solid waste abatement program.\n \n...Title\nTo authorize assessments for weed and solid waste removal on properties in violation of weed and solid waste regulations as set forth in the Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency.

That the City Clerk shall report to the Franklin County Auditor, all charges which are due to the City of Columbus, Department of Building & Zoning Services, Code Enforcement Division, and are certified for payment to the County Auditor in conformance with Sections 701.07 through 701.19 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 3. That said funds, upon reimbursement from the Franklin County Auditor, shall be deposited in the General Fund 1000, to repay the costs incurred for weed mowing and solid waste abatement services.\n \nSECTION 4.
