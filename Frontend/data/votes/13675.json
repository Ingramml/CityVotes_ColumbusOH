    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the amendment of Ordinance 0939-2023 so that the Director of the Department of Development may update the Department’s loan forgiveness policy for its homeownership services program to update and clarify that the policy meant to also include when a property has been transferred to the heirs.  \n \nThe Housing Division has operated programs focused on stabilizing low income homeowners since at least 1986. These programs provide critical and emergency home repairs such as roof replacements, water heater replacement, foundation stabilization, home modifications, connection to city water and sewer services. These services are a critical tool to ensure that residents are not faced with homelessness or additional financial hardship.\n \nHistorically, the programs have been funded by both local and federal funding sources, in the form of both grants and loans. Recognizing that there is a limited useful life of the home improvement and value for the City’s investment as well as the importance of ensuring that the City’s programs do not perpetuate inequitable outcomes or limit wealth building opportunities for those who have faced a legacy of systematic disinvestment; the Department of Development has implemented a loan forgiveness policy for its homeownership services. All federally funded loans that will be considered for forgiveness will have met all required affordability periods of the federal funding source.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to update the existing loan forgiveness policy associated with the Housing Division Homeowner Services program on loans closed on behalf of the City of Columbus. The policy is guided by Sections 335.01 and 335.012 and allows the Director to authorize the forgiveness of individual loans up to $2,500, the City Attorney to forgive individual loans up to $20,000, and loans over $20,000 will require City Council approval. The update to the policy to determine eligibility of qualifying loans is outlined in Exhibit A.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately establish and implement the updated policy to allow for the immediate review of the loan portfolio and the forgiveness of eligible loans to remove the burden for qualifying homeowners  and or heirs to help support housing stability.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the amendment of Ordinance 0939-2023 so that the Director of the Department of Development may update the loan forgiveness policy associated with the Housing Division Homeowner Services programs on loans closed on behalf of the City of Columbus; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Housing Division has operated programs focused on stabilizing low income homeowners since at least 1986. These programs provide critical and emergency home repairs such as roof replacements, water heater replacement, foundation stabilization, home modifications, connection to city water and sewer services. These services are a critical tool to ensure that residents are not faced with homelessness or additional financial hardship.\n \nWHEREAS, historically, the programs have been funded by both local and federal funding sources, in the form of both grants and loans. Recognizing that there is a limited useful life of home improvement and value for the City’s investment as well as the importance of ensuring that the City’s programs do not perpetuate inequitable outcomes or limit wealth building opportunities for those who have faced a legacy of systematic disinvestment, the Department of Development implemented a loan forgiveness policy for its homeownership repair services programs.\n \nWHEREAS, in the administration of the programs it is necessary to authorize the Director of Development to update the loan forgiveness policy associated with the Housing Division Homeowner Services programs on loans closed on behalf of the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, the updated policies and procedures to determine an eligible forgivable loan are outlined in Exhibit A and reflect that it was necessary to clarify the need include when a property is transferred to an heir; and\n \nWHEREAS, the policy is guided by Sections 335.01 and 335.012 of the Columbus City Code and authorizes the Director to forgive eligible loans up to $2,500, the City Attorney to forgive eligible loans up to $20,000 and eligible loans over $20,000 require City Council approval; and\n \nWHEREAS, emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to update the loan forgiveness policy to include when properties have transferred to the heirs and to allow for the immediate review of the loan portfolio and the forgiveness of eligible loans to remove the burden for qualifying homeowners to help support housing stability, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. The Director of the Department of Development is authorized to update the loan forgiveness policy originally authorized by Ordinance 0939-2023 and is attached as Exhibit A, which is associated with the Housing Division Homeowner Services programs on loans closed on behalf of the City of Columbus.\n \nSECTION 2. That based on the guidance of Sections 335.01 and 335.012 the Director is authorized to forgive eligible individual loans up to $2,500, the City Attorney is authorized to forgive eligible individual loans up to $20,000, and eligible individual loans over $20,000 will require City Council approval.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
