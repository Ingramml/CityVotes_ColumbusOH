($327,257.33)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Neighborhoods, to modify and extend a contract for annual maintenance and hosting related costs with Granicus, LLC (formerly Rock Solid Technology, Inc.) for the 311 Response System, OneView. \n \nThe Department of Neighborhoods uses the 311 Response System to facilitate customer contacts. The use of an off-the-shelf system, that is utilized in other communities, provides the 311 Customer Service Center with access to ongoing updates and industry best practices. This contributes to the ability of the 311 team to provide excellent customer service to all residents when they make contact by phone, e-mail, the 311 website, CBUS 311 mobile app, and in person at the Neighborhood Pride Centers. The intent of this contract is to continue to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Neighborhoods, with the 311 Response System, OneView. The contract includes annual maintenance and other hosting-related costs of the 311 Response System.  \n \nTo procure these services, a Request for Statement of Qualifications (RFSQ - SA011653) was published March 1, 2019.  The committee determined that Rock Solid Technology, Inc. met all requirements outlined in the RFSQ.  The committee recommended an award to the Director of the Department of Technology and Department of Neighborhoods, and was accepted. Due to the time required to fully review and evaluate all proposals, the bid that was submitted by Rock Solid Technology, Inc. in April of 2019 had since expired.  The vendor agreed to honor the pricing and terms and conditions presented in their April 2019 bid proposal.  Because the bid expired, a waiver of competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code was requested. Ordinance 1765-2020 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, to enter a five-year contract with Rock Solid Technology, Inc. for the above-described services, and waived the competitive bidding process.\n \nOrdinance 3182-2024 authorized a renewal at a total cost of $300,000.00 for a period of twelve (12) months, starting on March 30, 2025, and ending on March 29, 2026.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to modify the original contract by extending the term of the contract for a period of twelve months, starting on March 30, 2026, and ending on March 29, 2027, and adding funds in the amount of $327,257.33. This agreement also modifies the contract to add four annual renewal options, subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City authorities.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes a waiver of competitive bidding, in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes. Given the established relationship with this contractor, and the lack of sufficient time to obtain and award bids before the current contract expires, it is in the City’s best interest to utilize bid waiver legislation for this ordinance.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: \nThe original contract amount:                                                        $1,000,000.00 (PO243373, Ord. 1765-2020)                          \nModification #1:                                                                                                                $288,862.00 (PO442127, Ord. 3078-2023)\nRenewal #1:                                                                                     $300,000.00 (PO495500, Ord. 3182-2024)\nModification #2:                                                                                                          $327,257.33 (This ordinance)                       \n \nThe contract amount including all renewals/modifications: $1,916,119.33\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to provide additional funding to ensure continuity of service and maintain operational efficiency for the Department of Neighborhoods.  \n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe City currently uses the OneView 311 Response System provided by Granicus, LLC, which was originally procured through a competitive RFSQ process. Continuation of this contract ensures uninterrupted service, system compatibility, and access to ongoing updates and maintenance; therefore, it is in the best interest of the City to modify this contract, not have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes and waive competitive bidding provisions.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is based on the pricing as defined in the original proposal.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: Granicus, LLC\nVendor Account #: 007882\nExpiration date: 9/18/2027\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $327,257.33 is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund, Fund 5100.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify a contract with Granicus, LLC for the 311 Response System, OneView; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to authorize the expenditure of $327,257.33 from the Information Services Operating Fund.
