    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate purchase agreement (PA) with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing and “true-up.” Microsoft Office is the City’s technology standard for desktop computing software, currently used by approximately 9,000 City employees in their daily business. The City also utilizes Microsoft software to support various enterprise applications. This ordinance will enable the City to obtain the latest versions of Microsoft software utilizing a single agreement for the entire City. It will also allow for the true-up of additional licensing needed by the City, including additional O365 user licenses necessary for migrating City email to the Microsoft 365 cloud.\n \nOn September 21, 2023, the Department of Finance’s Purchasing Office published RFQ025795 to solicit quotes for a new three-year Microsoft Enterprise purchase agreement. Three submissions were received: Brown Enterprise Solutions, Dell Technologies, and GovConnect. The Purchasing Office recommended that the PA be awarded to Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC as the overall lowest, responsive, responsible, and best bidder. The term of this contract is three years, beginning on December 31, 2023, and ending on December 31, 2026. Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC is an authorized reseller of various Microsoft products, including those described above.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes appropriating $3,742,889.20 from the unappropriated balance of the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund to the Department of Technology for the above-described purpose.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $3,878,049.94. Of this amount, $135,160.74 is funded by the Municipal Court Judges General Fund and Municipal Court Computer Fund budget; and the balance of $3,742,889.20 is funded by the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this purchase are budgeted and available in the Municipal Court Judges General Fund and Municipal Court Computer Fund budgets, and the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund. This ordinance appropriates $3,742,889.20 from the unappropriated balance of the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund to the Department of Technology to fund the City’s portion of Microsoft Enterprise software licensing and “true-up” costs. The remaining $135,160.74 is budgeted within the Municipal Court Judges General Fund and Municipal Court Computer Fund budgets. Total expenditure authorization is $3,878,049.94.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested so that a purchase order is issued prior to the City Auditor’s end-of-year deadline of December 22, 2025, and to process payment due on the new Microsoft Enterprise licenses contract by January 1, 2026, from the supplier at the price offered. Failure to do so will jeopardize access to the various Microsoft applications that are used daily by the City.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC\nVendor Number: 010668\nExpiration Date: 2/2/2026\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate purchase agreement with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, an approved reseller of Microsoft products, for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing and “true-up” costs; to appropriate $3,742,889.20 from the unappropriated balance of the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund to the Department of Technology; to authorize the expenditure of $135,160.74 from the Municipal Court Judges General Fund and Municipal Court Computer Fund budget, to authorize the expenditure of $3,742,889.20 from the General Fund Income Tax Set-Aside subfund; and to declare an emergency.
