    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND AND FISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAs part of the 2025 third quarter financial review, the Department of Finance and Management identified surpluses and deficits in various object classes in several divisions.  In order to properly align appropriations with projected expenditures and allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2025, it is necessary to transfer $54,656,908.00 among divisions within the general fund and $2,245,500.00 in certain non-general fund departments and divisions.\n \nObject class surpluses and deficits were projected as part of the third quarter financial review.  This ordinance makes transfers to reflect these projections.   The amounts may not mirror the third quarter review exactly due to transfers that have occurred in the interim as well as adjustments made in projections since the completion of the review.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes appropriation transfers and additional appropriations for certain non-general fund departments and divisions in order to provide appropriations in the necessary object classes for the remainder of the fiscal year. \n \nThis ordinance is contingent upon the passage of Ordinance 3222-2025.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow these financial transactions to be posted in the city's accounting system as soon as possible to allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2025.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to provide for the transfer of $54,656,908.00 within the general fund; to transfer $2,245,500.00 in appropriations between objects in certain non-general fund departments and divisions; to authorize transfers between funds of $7,009,055.00; to authorize an appropriation within the Recreation and Parks Operating fund, Print & Mail Services fund, and the Property Management fund, and to declare an emergency.
