(vendor #004349 & SOS #426380), for the purchase of five (5) Class 2 Fill Stations to be installed at five (5) different fire stations.  The Division of Fire has the immediate need to purchase these Class 2 Fill Stations to replace some of the current fill stations due to the unsafe open container system that does not provide protection in the event of a system failure, bottle breach or explosion.\nBid Information:  The Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding via Request for Quotation No. RFQ031351; two (2) bids were received as follows:\n \nSub-Aquatics, Inc                                          $54,993.20                     Lowest Acceptable Bidder\nPositive Slopes, LLC                                          $70,945.00                     No Low Bid\n \nBid Waiver Justification:  The original quote that Sub-Aquatics, Inc’s submitted with their bid expires less than 180 days from the date of award. Purchasing has advised that due to the expiration date of the quote the vendor’s bid has been deemed nonresponsive. Since they were the lowest bidder, Purchasing has reached out to them to see if they would extend the expiration date to meet the 180 day requirement. Vendor complied and supplied an updated quote that meets the requirement.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested due to the immediate need to replace the current unsafe Fill Stations.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $54,993.20 from the Division of Fire's General Fund operating budget to purchase five (5) Class 2 Fill Stations to replace the current unsafe Fill Stations. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to issue a purchase order to Sub-Aquatics, Inc. for the purchase of five (5) Class 2 Fill Stations for use in emergency firefighting operations; to authorize the expenditure of $54,993.20 from the General Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provision of the Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency.
