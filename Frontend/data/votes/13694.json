($1,200,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract modification to add funding with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF)-General Program #5 project, CIP #650360-100003, in an amount up to $1,200,000.00. \n \nOverall Engineering Consultant Services (OEC) are necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the City and its design professionals in planning and coordination of the work.   The OEC services are separated into several tasks, as follows:\n \n                     Task 1 - Planning Services\n                     Task 2 - Design Services\n                     Task 3 - Construction Related Services\n                     Task 4 - Commissioning and Start-up Services\n                     Task 5 - General and Additional Services\n                     Task 6 - Project Management\n \nThe City will request a task order from the consultant as necessary work is identified.  The task order submitted typically includes a detailed scope of work, direct and indirect costs, task schedule, estimated hours, personnel categories required with labor rates, and reimbursable expenses.  After negotiation and upon acceptance by the city, the consultant shall commence work.  The Engineer shall provide such professional engineering services as may be necessary to accomplish the work required to be performed and shall at the firm’s cost, furnish all necessary competent personnel, equipment, and materials to perform the work.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,200,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                              $800,000.00 (ORD 0601-2023 PO382045)\nMod #1 Amount:                                          $1,200,000.00 (ORD 1376-2024 PO458457)\nMod #2 Amount:                                          $1,200,000.00 (Current)\nTotal (Orig.+ Modifications):                      $3,200,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was originally planned as a 3-year effort with annual funding modifications because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them.  A new procurement effort is not required to add funding.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Black & Veatch Corporation and the project team based upon the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project provides many metrics on various environmental factors that are noted in the work to be performed.  The information provided assists and guides the City in decision making on environmental issues.  These decisions have a direct impact on the capital improvement program budget amounts and scheduling to address the environmental needs.  No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3.
