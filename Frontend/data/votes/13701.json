    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with CH2M Hill Engineers, Inc. (Ch2M), for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) Hypochlorite Disinfection Improvements project, CIP No. 690487-100000, in an amount up to $1,533,000.00.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the PAWP Hypochlorite Disinfection Improvements project.   This project provides for engineering design and construction of improvements to the disinfection storage and feed facilities at PAWP.  The plant currently utilizes a chlorine gas based process and this project will convert the plant to a liquid sodium hypochlorite based process.  This conversion will provide for safer storage and handling of chemicals used for disinfection while switching to a much less toxic chemical.  \n \nThis contract modification provides continued funding for Engineering Services During Construction.  Another modification is planned to add funding to complete Engineering Services During Construction.   \n \nPAWP serves multiple Columbus Communities so this project is coded as 99-citywide.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,533,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                            $589,800.00 (Ord. 2896-2016,PO050804)\nModification 1 Amount:                                             $1,632,200.00 (Ord. 2956-2019,PO209640)\nModification 2 Amount:                                           $1,747,700.00 (Ord. 1398-2023, PO404081) \nModification 3 (current):                                           $1,533,000.00  \nModification 4 (Future):                                                                       $1,000,000.00 (Estimate) \nTotal (Orig. + Modifications):                                             $6,502,700.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nAnother procurement process is not required.  This contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process with planned funding modifications through construction completion and acceptance by the City.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on existing contract rates and allowable expenses.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved the estimate after negotiations.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will address the risks associated with a gaseous chlorine system while providing a safer storage and handling system for plant staff.  The potential threat of an accidental or intentional release of chlorine gas will be eliminated with this project. \n \nThis work will occur within the secure area of the PAWP that is not accessible to the public, so public meetings and outreach are not anticipated. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nCh2M’s contract compliance number is CC006247 and expires 4/9/27.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Ch2M.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Ch2M has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work on this modification:\n \nCompany Name                                      City/State                             ODI Certification Status\nDLZ, Inc                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nHatch Associates Consultants                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nResource International                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n360 Water                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \nThe certification of Ch2M and the above subconsultants was in good standing at the time the modification was authorized.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT\nThis design contract modification is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized submitting WSRLA loan applications and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 0348-2025, passed by City Council on 4/28/25.  This design modification was not on the list of projects City Council approved for submission of WSRLA loans via Ordinance 0348-2025.  Section 2 of that ordinance gave City Council’s approval for projects to be added and subtracted from the list due to schedule changes or department need.  OWDA still requires an ordinance specifically mentioning each project.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA January Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.\n \nThe WSRLA program is now a reimbursement program.  Public Utilities will need to pay Ch2M’s invoices and submit them to OWDA for reimbursement.\n \nAn amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  Funds will also need to be appropriated in the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund, Fund 6011.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for PAWP Hypochlorite Disinfection Improvements with CH2M Hill Engineers, Inc. to add additional funding; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation of funds; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to apply for and accept a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account program; to make this ordinance contingent upon the Ohio Water Development Authority approving a loan for this project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,533,000.00 from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund.
