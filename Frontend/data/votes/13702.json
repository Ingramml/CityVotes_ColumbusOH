    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to participate in the Verizon Wireless National Association of Procurement Officials (NASPO) ValuePoint cooperative purchase agreement, Master Agreement Number 152 (MA152) for the purpose of building a secure, isolated network for the Department of Public Utilities’ (DPU) remote Water Distribution SCADA sites. \n \nThe desire to join this cooperative agreement is due to the cost and security benefits. This service supports a new radio telemetry system that connects DPU field sites to the control network. Verizon was selected early in the design because they were able to configure a private, isolated cellular network segment not exposed to the public internet - a capability DPU believes other carriers can not provide. The system design, hardware specifications, and path studies were all completed around that configuration. In addition to the isolated network and security benefits, the cost is better than current data line contracts with AT&T. Because of the security and cost benefits, it is in the City’s best interest to waive competitive bidding provisions and authorize the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to participate in the Master Agreement.\n \nThis Master Agreement is led by the State of Utah and has been joined by 33 other states. Ohio is not yet a participating member, which is another reason it is in the City’s best interest to waive competitive bidding provisions. \n \nVENDOR:   \n \nCellco Partnership, DBA Verizon Wireless. | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #001698 | Expired 09/24/2022 (pending update)\n \nThe Contractor is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search. \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$13,780.00 is available for participation in this agreement. It represents the annual estimated costs of the network at full build out. The per site cost is $15/month. While unbudgeted, it is expected to result in decreased costs on our AT&T data contract.\n \n$0.00 has been spent year-to-date in 2025\n$0.00 was spent in 2024 \n$0.00 was spent in 2023 \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to participate in the Verizon Wireless National Association of Procurement Officials (NASPO) ValuePoint cooperative purchase agreement; to authorize the expenditure of $13,780.00 from the Water Operating Fund; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code. ($13,780.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities has a need for secure communication networks for its remote Water Distribution SCADA sites; and\n \nWHEREAS, Verizon Wireless can meet these security needs through the private network components of its National Association of Procurement Officials (NASPO) ValuePoint cooperative purchase agreement, Master Agreement Number 152; and\n \nWHEREAS, the cost is better than current data contracts at $15 per month for each site; and\n \nWHEREAS, the State of Ohio is not currently a participating member in the Master Agreement, which is led by the State of Utah and joined by 33 other states; and \n \nWHEREAS, due to the cost and security benefits of participating in this agreement, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding of City Code and authorize DPU to participate in the agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, the expenditure of $13,780.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from object class 03, Services in the Water Operating Fund, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance; and                     \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to participate in the Verizon Wireless National Association of Procurement Officials (NASPO) ValuePoint cooperative purchase agreement; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to participate in the NASPO cooperative purchasing agreement (MA152) with Verizon Wireless for the purpose of building a secure, isolated network for DPU’s remote Water Distribution SCADA sites. \n \nSECTION 2.  That this Council finds it in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code for participation in the NASPO cooperating purchasing agreement (MA152).\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $13,780.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from object class 03, Services in the Water Operating Fund, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.
