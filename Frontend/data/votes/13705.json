    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC for development of a 23-unit affordable housing development in an amount up to $5,000,000.00.  This agreement will also permit expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order, starting January 1, 2024, for construction costs.\nHealthy Homes is a non-profit affordable housing developer, affiliated with Community Development for All People and Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  It is focused on increasing the stock of high-quality housing options available to families earning no more than 80% of Area Median Income (AMI) in Linden. Healthy Linden Homes V LLC seeks to further address Columbus’s housing affordability issues by developing 23 units of new construction rental housing in zip code 43211. These properties will consist of infill development, designed to replace residential structures that have been demolished.\nThe 23 rental units for which funding is sought will consist of 11 single family homes and 6 duplexes. Eleven of these properties will be built by Unibilt Industries-a modular home builder located in Dayton, Ohio. The modular units will be delivered approximately 75% complete and set on full foundations. Healthy Homes, the developer, has engaged General Contractors who will complete all site preparations, construct the foundations and manage the balance of work post-delivery. Once delivered, the units will require mechanical connections for electric, plumbing and HVAC. Porches will be constructed on site, and there will be some minor interior finishes to finalize. Lastly, the General Contractor will pour concrete parking pads and walkways, and each site will be fully landscaped with sod and a shade tree. The units that are not modular are traditional stick construction. Upon completion, these projects will blend with the existing fabric of the community, and there will be no visible evidence to suggest that they are modular in nature.\nIn addition to high-quality, affordable places to call home, the tenant families who will reside in these units will have access to a variety of supportive services and advocacy opportunities. Healthy Homes links residents to health/social service providers and Nationwide Children’s Healthy Neighborhoods Healthy Families (HNHF) programming. More specifically, tenants will have improved access to health, educational, workforce, and life skills development opportunities. Financial literacy, parenting classes, and mental health services will also be emphasized. Service engagement will not be required for Healthy Homes’ families, but it will be available to all households as needed.\nOrdinance 3082-2024, passed on November 25, 2024, allowed for the establishment of a Housing Development Agreement to utilize Affordable Housing bond funds from the City’s Capital Budget in the amount of $5,000,000.00 for the project.  \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule and to meet deadlines for this project.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding in the amount of $5,000,000.00 is available in 2025 Capital Improvement Budget, Affordable Housing Bond fund. An amendment to the 2025 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 050785 and expires 10/30/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Healthy Linden Homes V LLC for development of a 23-unit affordable housing development in an amount up to $5,000,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $5,000,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
