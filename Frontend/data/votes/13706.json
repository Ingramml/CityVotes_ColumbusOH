    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership Inc. for an affordable housing development in an amount up to $2,500,000.00.  Columbus Housing Partnership Inc. will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  Easton Place Homes III, LLC is the ownership entity of the project with Columbus Housing Partnership Inc. being the majority owner of the managing member. \nEaston Place Phase III will create 50 apartments for families and individuals, with a mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. The project consists of one four-story, new-construction building. The third phase’s completion will finish the shared vision of the City of Columbus, Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc. (dba Homeport) and The Georgetown Company to develop 200 affordable rental apartments at Easton Town Center, which has one of Central Ohio’s largest concentrations of jobs in the office, retail and hospitality sectors. The project will strengthen the nexus between affordable housing and jobs for employees at Easton Town Center.\nEaston Place’s first phase finished construction in January 2024 and its second phase finished construction in May 2025 at adjacent sites. The third phase will share the following amenities with the development’s first two phases: access to public transit, access to jobs, access to groceries, community room, fitness center, on-site laundry, on-site management, package concierge, playground, and security cameras.\nEaston Place Phase III will be certified under the LEED sustainability program and will include six fully accessible apartments, greater than the amount required by Section 504. The units developed in Phase III will be restricted to households whose annual income is at or 60% of Area Median Income (AMI).\nThe project will be financed by equity from 4% federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and state LIHTC, a permanent loan, and deferred developer fee, in addition to the requested commitment of bond funds from the City of Columbus. The project will also be financed by a tax-exempt bond, in order to meet the requirements for 4% federal LIHTC, and a construction loan.\nEaston Place Homes III, LLC is the ownership entity of the project with Columbus Housing Partnership Inc. being the majority owner of the managing member of Easton Place Homes III, LLC.  The Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership Inc., who will act as a pass-through entity to loan the funds to Easton Place Homes III, LLC.\nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule and to meet deadlines for this project.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding in the amount of $2,500,000.00 is available in 2025 Capital Improvement Budget, Affordable Housing Bond fund. An amendment to the 2025 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 004842 and expires 03/13/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership Inc. for an affordable housing development in an amount up to $2,500,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,500,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
