    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with National Church Residences for an affordable senior housing development in an amount up to $2,000,000.00.  National Church Residences will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  Scarborough Senior Housing Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of the project and National Church Residences is the owner of the limited partnership. \nOrdinance No. 2210-2025, passed on September 8, 2025, allowed for the establishment of a Housing Development Agreement to utilize Affordable Housing bond funds from the City’s Capital Budget in the amount of $2,000,000.00 for the project.  \nThe Scarborough is a proposed new construction, affordable senior housing community designed to house low-income seniors aged 62+ within Central Ohio. The project consists of eighty-four (84) one and two-bedroom units of new construction in an elevator-served building located on the Near East Side of Columbus. National Church Residences & Trinity Baptist Church with Development Partner, Nix Development Company, have partnered together to build senior housing on the Trinity Baptist campus and serve the seniors who reside there holistically, allowing them to stay home for life.\nNational Church Residences received funding for the development costs through the HUD Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program, which will pair with 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits. The HUD Section 202 Housing for the Elderly award will also include rental subsidy for approximately 45 one-bedroom apartments and will include an on-site Service Coordinator who will be funded out of project rents.\nThe Scarborough will consist of one building with eighty-four (84) one and two-bedroom apartment units. Each unit has a separate kitchen, bathroom, living area, and bedroom. A percentage of the residential units will be designed to be 100% accessible and will be consistent with Section 504, Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards, Fair Housing and ADAAG. This apartment community also includes dedicated staff office space, commons areas for social and wellness activities.\nIn addition, National Church Residences will incorporate building design features to enable residents to age in place including but not limited to accessible means of egress/ingress for each unit, 36” door widths, lever handles, and faucets, clear floor space of 30” x 50”, and accessible locations of lighting and environmental controls. The building will also incorporate sustainable design practices and methods in accordance with LEED for Homes standards.
