    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a service contract with Opticos Design, Inc. for the design and publication of an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) guide for Columbus residents for an amount up to $50,000 from the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund.\nWith pending code change language, there will likely be more focus on ADU development and a demand for additional guidance. Public hearings and citizen feedback have indicated that there is a large knowledge gap for people who wish to build ADUs. There is a need for guidance to help residents and homeowners understand and navigate the process of building an ADU. The guidebook will include up-to-date relevant details about the zoning code, building code, city permitting processes, and practical tips and steps for citizens seeking to build an ADU. The manual will build on existing and draft guides, including the draft produced by Jonathan Barnes Architecture in 2024 and the guidebook developed by AARP. The product will be ready on or before June 1, 2026. \nCompetitive bidding will be waived as Opticos Design, Inc. is currently a subcontractor with BZS and has specialized knowledge around local building and zoning code and has created unique partnership with the department that will be critical to producing this manual in a timely and accurate manner.\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the work to align with the pending code change for a final product by June 2026. Without emergency action, there will be further delays in ADU construction.\nFiscal Impact: Funding in the amount of $50,000.00 is available in Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund.\nContract compliance: Opticos Design, Inc. contract compliance number is CC-034460 and expires 11/19/2027.\nTitle\nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a service contract with Opticos Design, Inc. for the design and publication of an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) guide for Columbus residents for an amount up to $50,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund; to authorize an appropriation of $50,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund; to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund; and to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
