    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nColumbus is growing and is in need of more housing options. This ordinance seeks to amend the Zoning Code, Title 33, to allow Accessory Dwelling Units (“ADUs”), an additional dwelling unit which has a separate and independent means of ingress and egress that is located on the same lot as and is subordinate to a principal dwelling or apartment house, in all residential and apartment residential districts. Currently, ADUs must go through an extensive Council variance procedure to be allowed on residential and apartment residential lots. These revisions will allow ADUs “by right” in residential and apartment residential districts within Chapters 3332 and 3333 subject to specific conditions, allowing them to be built more expeditiously. \n \nADUs offer solutions for families to provide housing for aging parents or adult children and can provide an additional source of income to contribute to housing stability. Through the increased access to housing and wealth-building opportunities that accessory dwelling units bring, legacy residents will have more options for aging in place with dignity.\n \nADUs can also be a means of increasing the supply of market-rate and affordable rental housing in a community, and accommodating new growth without dramatic changes to the character of a neighborhood. \n \nThe code revisions propose that ADUs must be clearly accessory and subordinate in scale to a principal dwelling or apartment house, and include allowances for interior/internal, attached, or detached ADUs. They also include specific provisions related to the maximum number of ADUs allowed; maximum height and size; exemptions for parking, frontage, and lot width requirements; increased lot coverage; reduced side and rear yard standards; and increased home occupation. These provisions were established by analyzing ADU legislation from other U.S. cities and jurisdictions as well as the variance requests and issued building permits for ADUs in Columbus between 2019 and September of 2025. Between that time, 110 Council variances have been approved, and 57 building permits have been issued. \n \nAll ADUs will be subject to the Building Code and must obtain permits prior to construction. Certificates of Appropriateness or Approval will be required in historic and architectural review areas.\n \nThe code revisions also propose habitable space not directly connected to a dwelling unit to be allowed by right. This type of project is slightly different than an ADU in that it does not result in a separate dwelling unit, rather, it only includes some components of a dwelling unit like a bedroom with a bathroom or home office space. These projects are also subject to an extensive Council variance procedure, and 34 such variances to allow habitable space above, within, or connected to a detached garage have been approved between 2019 and September of 2025.  \n \nThe code revisions include newly defined terms, new sections within Chapter 3321 related to sheds, utility enclosures, and fences, and reorganization of other code provisions to achieve more efficient administration of the Zoning Code without substantively changing said regulations.\n \nCity Council held public hearings on July 22, 2025, September 10, 2025, and October 29, 2025, to review and consider the proposed code amendments, and held a 60-day public comment period between August 27, 2025 and October 25, 2025, to collect resident feedback.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo repeal and amend various sections in Title 33 of the Columbus City Codes, entitled “Zoning Code,”  to allow Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) in all residential and apartment residential districts, to allow habitable space not directly connected to a dwelling unit, and to enact newly defined terms and new sections for development standards related to sheds, utility enclosures, and fences.
