    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an increase in Stormwater charges effective January 1, 2026 and amends Chapter 1149 of the Columbus City Codes. \n \nWith the 2026 rates increases for water, sewer, and storm combined -- based on an average residential customer with water use of 20 ccf's per quarter, City of Columbus residents are estimated to see their total bill increase $10.48 per month, or $125.80 per year, which equates to a combined bill increase of 11.72%. Low Income Discount participant's overall bill impact is 11.65%. Outside city customers overall bill impact is 12.88%. Customer's bill impact will vary with usage. \n \nThe stormwater charges per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) will increase from $.1720 per day per ERU to $.1754 per day per ERU. This increase results in approximately $.31 being added to a typical residential bill for 2026. For 2025 an average stormwater bill is approximately $15.49 and is estimated to increase to $15.80 in 2026. \n \nThe stormwater ERU charge is assessed based on each property’s measured impervious surface area.  Each Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) is based on 2,000 sq ft of impervious surface area.  Residents are charged at one (1) ERU per residence.  All other customers are charged based on measured impervious area divided by 2,000 sq ft to determine an ERU equivalent.\n \nThe Utility Advisory Board (UAB) met on October 29, 2025 and after reviewing the Department of Public Utilities' projected expenditures for Fiscal Year 2026, recommends to City Council a two-percent (2%) increase in storm rates. \n \n FISCAL IMPACT: These rate increases will generate approximately $404,000 in additional revenue in Fiscal Year 2026. Combined with rate increases for Sewer and Water, the overall impact to a City of Columbus' residents bill will be an 11.72% increase, depending on usage.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Sections 1149.07 and 1149.08 of the Columbus City Codes, to enact new Stormwater fees for the year beginning January 1, 2026, and to repeal the existing Sections being amended.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Utility Advisory Board met on October 29, 2025 and after reviewing the Department of Public Utilities projected expenditures for 2026, recommends to City Council an increase of two-percent in stormwater rates, and\n \nWHEREAS, stormwater fees are not charged to those customers outside of the City of Columbus, and\n \nWHEREAS, if stormwater bills are not paid within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of billing, a gross rate, which is the net rate plus ten (10) percent, shall apply, and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to increase the monthly Stormwater charges from $.1720 per day per ERU to $.1754 per day per ERU to accurately match needed revenue to estimated program expenses; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities to amend Sections 1149.07 and 1149.08 for the public health, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.   That effective January 1, 2026, Section 1149.07 of the Columbus City Codes is amended to read as follows:\n \n1149.07 Billings and terms of payment.\n(a)                     Billings.
