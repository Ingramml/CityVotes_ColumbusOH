    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to amend Title 45 of the Columbus City Codes by enacting a new Chapter 4553 and to regulate the practice of utility reselling for residential properties in the City of Columbus. Currently, the majority of Columbus’ residents living in multifamily rental properties are not directly billed for utility services by a utility provider, but rather by a property owner or a third party that resells utility services obtained from a utility provider to residents based either on master meters or on sub meters. This legislation will protect Columbus residents from inflated utility bills, increase bill transparency, and ensure discount programs reach residents who need it most. A public hearing was held in October 2025 to allow for industry leaders and the community to comment on the implications of this change. \n \nTitle \n \nTo amend Title 45 of the Columbus City Codes by enactment of new Chapter 4553; to regulate the practice of utility reselling for residential properties in the City of Columbus.   \n \nBody \n \nWHEREAS, affordable and reasonably priced utility services are essential for the residents of Columbus, and the State of Ohio; and \n \nWHEREAS, the majority of Columbus’ residents living in multifamily rental properties are not directly billed for utility services by a utility provider, but rather by a property owner or some other third party that resells utility services obtained from a utility provider to residents based either on master meters or on submeters; and \n \nWHEREAS, these residents currently lack the option of procuring utility services in a competitive market, affecting their access to reasonably priced utility service; and \n \nWHEREAS, charges from a property owner or other third party, based on a master meter and/or submeter, can result in higher charges and total bills for residential rental property consumers than they would pay if provided the same services directly from the utility provider; and  \n \nWHEREAS, some City residents may not be aware that they are being resold utility service at a potentially higher cost and without the rights and protections afforded to customers billed directly by a utility provider; and \n \nWHEREAS, residents in a master metered building often receive no utility bill, which prohibits their access to existing utility discount programs for seniors and low-income families; \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus has utility discount programs that only have 8,500 participants, and   \n \nWHEREAS, access to water and power are essential to the health of our community; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the City has found it necessary for the safety, health and welfare of the public to provide minimum requirements for the practice of utility reselling to ensure all City residents have access to appropriately priced utility service and all assistance programs; now, therefore \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1. That Title 45 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended with the attachment to this ordinance  \n \nSECTION 2.  All applicable entities must be in compliance with this code section within 1 year of the ordinance effective date. \n \nSECTION 3. That this ordinance shall take effect at the earliest date allowable by law.",
