This requires additional revenue sharing for tax year 2024. The total amount of additional revenue to be shared is $284,114.65.  This agreement is related to a project located in one (1) school district with the additional revenue sharing of $284,114.65 to the Olentangy Local School District.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to expedite payment to the one (1) school district to compensate them for property tax revenues forgone due to tax abatement.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The 2025 General Fund budget (citywide account) includes funding for these payments.
