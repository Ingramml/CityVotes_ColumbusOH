($81,322.22)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Complete General Construction Company for the Intersection - Cleveland Avenue at Myrtle Avenue project in an amount up to $81,322.22.\nOrdinance 1123-2024 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Complete General Construction Company for the construction of the Intersection - Cleveland Avenue at Myrtle Avenue project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.\n \nThis project was previously awarded funds from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program which provides annual grants on a formula basis to entitled cities and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons.  The amount needed for the original contract was included in the City’s current Action Plan for the Community Development Block Grant Intersection - Cleveland Avenue at Myrtle Avenue Project as established in ordinance 2993-2023.\n \nThe work performed to date for this project consists of curb removal and installation, resurfacing, full signal replacement, reinstallation of interconnect, relocation of street lighting and power lines, water line lowering, and installation of storm sewer down Myrtle Avenue, and other work necessary to complete the contract in accordance with the plans.\n \nThe work for modification 1 will consist of restoring the roadway in two areas as a result from installing the storm line on East Myrtle Avenue. Electric and communications conduit/lines +/- 5 feet higher than shown on the Mulby Place drawings. Subsequently, the lines dissected the proposed storm line. This caused a 32 foot x 12 foot section of East Myrtle to be removed to relocate and lower these conduits. The second issue resulted from gas service at East Myrtle and Linden that was not indicated on the plan documents. As a result, the new manhole had to be shifted and a larger excavation was required for safety as using a trench box as required due to depth in this area was not possible. The modification will include other such work that is deemed  necessary to complete the contract.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $81,322.22\nThe original contract amount, no inspection:                                                                             $1,116,578.43  (PO447036/PO447037, Ord. 1123-2024)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:                                                                      $81,322.22       (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                                                                     $1,197,900.65  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is to compensate the contractor for work that needed to be conducted to restore the roadway related to their current project. Rebidding this minimal amount of work would not have been feasible.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nFurther delay through use of procurement other than emergency modification will cost delay reimbursement to the contractor for costs incurred by contractor already due to the forementioned details. \n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost to compensate the contractor exceeded the contingency balance on the original contract, resulting in the modification amount needed to supplement the cost of the contractor incurred for the repairs.  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Complete General Construction Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Complete General Construction Company is CC006056 and expires 10/17/2027.\n \n3.  Pre-Qualification Status\nComplete General Construction Company and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $81,322.22 is budgeted, available, and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to compensate the contractor for work that needed to be conducted to restore the roadway related to the Intersection - Cleveland Avenue at Myrtle Avenue project, and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Complete General Construction Company in connection with the Intersection - Cleveland Avenue at Myrtle Avenue project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $81,322.22 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
