    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with Ohio State University College of Social Work in the amount up to $152,277.00 to support the implementation of the One Linden Schools Initiative (OLSI) at Hamilton STEM Academy and Windsor STEM Academy.\nOLSI works to ensure schools in Linden function as community hubs, providing access to programs and services that address both academic and non-academic needs. OLSI extends and complements district priorities such as curriculum alignment, professional development, and trauma-informed instruction. The five strategic priorities are: (1) address academic gaps, (2) meet basic needs for student learning, (3) expand access to coordinated health and behavioral services, (4) enhance positive youth development experiences and out-of-school learning programs, and (5) strengthen family and community engagement.\nOLSI utilizes the Community Collaboration Model (CCM), an evidence-based model developed by leaders at the Community and Youth Collaborative Institute at the College of Social Work at The Ohio State University, to directly engage students, parents, guardians, and educators at the two schools. \nThis ordinance seeks to allow for the reimbursement of program expenses incurred on or after August 1, 2025, prior to execution of the purchase order. Grant funding for programming includes the purchase of food and/or non-alcoholic beverage items for program participants, which serve the public for the purpose of administering community-based and school-based programming. Food and/or non-alcoholic beverage purchases will be subject to what is allowable in the grant agreement. Any cost of food and/or non-alcoholic beverage incurred before the effective date of the ordinance will not be reimbursed. Costs will not exceed $15 per person, and any purchase of alcohol is strictly prohibited.\n \nFiscal Impact: The fiscal impact associated with the grant is up to $152,277.00 to come from the Fund 1000 General Fund (GF).\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in providing the resources necessary to Ohio State University College of Social Work to support the One Linden Schools Initiative for the 2025/2026 school year.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with Ohio State University College of Social Work in support of the One Linden Schools Initiative; and to authorize the expenditure from the General Fund; and to authorize the payment of non-food related program expenses incurred starting August 1, 2025; and to allow food and/or non-alcoholic beverage expenses incurred after the effective date of the ordinance; and to declare an emergency.
