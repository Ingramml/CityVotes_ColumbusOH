    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the City Attorney to accept $166,650 in grant funding from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners. Grant funding supports a portion of the total compensation for the Columbus City Attorney’s Grants Manger to continue leading the Blueprint for Safety: Interagency Domestic Violence Response initiative.\nThis position was previously funded through a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, Office on Violence Against Women. Both the City and the County recognize the ongoing value of this role and the importance of continued investment. The combination of this grant and an allocation from the City Attorney’s General Fund will fully fund the position through the end of 2026.\nThe Blueprint for Safety initiative is built on a multidisciplinary team approach that coordinates a comprehensive response to domestic violence crimes. This collaborative effort enables our jurisdiction to streamline justice services, close system gaps and create seamless linkages between justice and community provider systems. Blueprint promotes safety, accountability, and opportunities for rehabilitation-with the overarching goal of improving justice outcomes and breaking cycles of family violence.\nFiscal Impact:\n\n\n\nAward #\n\nFC BOC Award\n\n\n\nTBA\n\n$ 166,650.00\n\n\n \nEmergency Action\nThe grant award was not received until October 2025, despite a start date of January 1, 2025.
