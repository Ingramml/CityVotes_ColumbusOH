    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to modify an existing contract with ImageTrend, LLC, to include a license management product in the subscription to the comprehensive records management system (RMS) 2025-2026 contract. The modification amount authorized by this ordinance is $66,000.\nImageTrend, LLC was awarded a contract via ordinance 1664-2025 passed by Columbus City Council on June 30, 2025 to provide access to EMS and Fire Incident reporting, in addition to fire inspection reporting software. Each year, the Columbus Division of Fire (CFD) responds to over 170,000 calls for service. Each EMS incident requires an incident report to be completed in a NEMSIS 3.4 compliant format that meets national standards. This data and information is currently maintained in 2 local unsecured Access databases for analytics and annual reporting. The modification needed to this contract with ImageTrend, LLC is for a License Management product which will be responsible for the tracking of employee training and medical information and will be maintained in a new secure, cloud-based infrastructure for reliable access, ensuring licensing compliance with regulatory standards. This record keeping of data and information helps in maintaining inventory of various tools, supplies and other items for the Division of Fire.\n \nSUPPLIER: ImageTrend, LLC, Vendor No.: 023084; FID: 41-1903871. \n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nThe total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification is $66,000.  The total cost for this contract including modification for year 1 is $635,431.20.  The option for this additional service was included as an optional add-on service in the quote for the existing contract. The need for additional funds was anticipated after identifying the need for secure databases.  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original contract and no other changes in pricing and/or conditions are anticipated at this time. The cost was determined through the vendor's original RFP response.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes payment of the remaining balance of $66,000 to ImageTrend, LLC for the License Management system.  Any future contract modification or extensions will be authorized in subsequent ordinances.  Funds are available within the Department of Public Safety's 2025 General Fund Budget for this contract modification.  \n \nEmergency Designation: This ordinance is being processed as an emergency measure in order to meet the project timeline of issuing a Purchase Order thereby preventing interruption of this vital service.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to modify an existing contract with ImageTrend, LLC for a License Management system addition to the current comprehensive records management system; to authorize the expenditure of $66,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
