    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain AED Medical Devices and Supplies with Zoll Medical Corporation, CC# CC-000197, expires 9/24/2026.  This contract provides for defibrillators, medical devices and supplies for use in daily emergency services and emergency medical service (EMS) operations.   The Division of Fire is the sole user of defibrillators and related supplies. This modification is necessary because this medical equipment needs to be readily available for emergency services.    The contract, PO368035, was established in accordance with a negotiated contract with Zoll Medical Corporation and will expire December 31, 2025. It is in the best interest of the City to modify and extend the contract through December 31, 2026.\n \nPursuant to Section 329.09(a) of Columbus City Codes:\n(1) Amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: N/A\n(2) Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded: N/A\n(3) Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter: because this medical equipment needs to be readily available for emergency services and the current contract expires on December 31, 2025\n(4) How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined: N/A\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency because the contract expires on December 31, 2025 and AED medical devices and supplies need to be readily available to ensure EMS response services can continue daily without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Department of Public Safety must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend the contract for the option to purchase AED Medical Devices and Supplies with Zoll Medical Corporation, and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for AED Medical Devices and Supplies for use by the Division of Fire; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing Universal Term Contract with Zoll Medical Corporation, to ensure EMS response services can continue without interruption; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a Universal Term Contract with Zoll Medical Corporation for the option to obtain AED Medical Devices and Supplies used in daily emergency services and emergency medical service (EMS) operations and to avoid interruption as the contract expires on December 31, 2025, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend a contract for option to obtain AED Medical Devices and Supplies with Zoll Corporation for a period of one (1) year to and including December 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
