    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \nThe Franklin County Municipal Court requests authorization to establish a Special Revenue subfund entitled “Court Modernization Fund”, to accept funds from court costs and provide funding for court projects supporting the Municipal Court’s transition to the new courthouse.\nThe Court is required by Ohio law to publish new court case filings in a printed law journal. Funds for advertising have been collected through court fees as detailed in the Court’s Local Rules. The court received notification on November 6, 2025, that the law journal of record will cease operations on December 12, 2025.  The Municipal Court will deposit the fees into the Court Modernization Fund until a new procedure is determined.\nThe court may use these collected fees to support costs related to court functions and facilitate the transfer to the new courthouse. These costs include, but are not limited to, professional review of court processes and operating procedures, staff education, transition towards a paperless environment, and technology planning and investment to ensure construction incorporates appropriate technological efficiencies.\nFISCAL IMPACT: Court costs from the Court Modernization fee will be deposited into this Special Revenue subfund to be used for improving court functions in preparation for the new courthouse.\nEmergency legislation is requested to establish the fund in sufficient time to begin accepting deposits when the law journal ceases operations. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to create a Special Revenue subfund titled “Court Modernization Fund” for the purpose of depositing proceeds received from court costs; to authorize the use of such funds for court projects supporting the Municipal Court’s transfer to the new courthouse; to appropriate an amount up to, but not to exceed, the unencumbered cash balance in the subfund; to authorize the expenditure of said funds for such purposes; and to declare an emergency.

That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to establish a subfund within Municipal Court Computer, Fund No. 2227, titled Court Modernization Fund, in order to properly track and account for the fiscal activities.\nSECTION 2.
