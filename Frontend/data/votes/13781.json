    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into professional engineering contracts with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & Dehaven, Inc., in an amount up to $650,000.00, and G-A-I Consultants, Inc., in an amount up to $100,000.00, for General Engineering Services 2024-2026, CIP #670868-100002, for the Division of Power. \n \nThe Division of Power (DOP) has lost several staff members in recent years.  The General Engineering Services contract has been used to supplement DOP design resources to ensure projects stay on track.  DOP is very shorthanded with engineering staff and needs to utilize this contract for technical support. A lot of work has been put on hold that must be restarted to avoid delaying public and private utility projects like the ODOT 70/71 project and small cell towers.\nServices to be performed under this contract include providing designs to connect new customers, reviewing applications for Joint Use and plan reviews, Substation Design, Transmission Line Design, Distribution Line Design, Underground Distribution Design, Equipment Upgrade Program, Grounding Studies, SCADA, Streetlight Design, Power Quality Issues, Development of Bid Packages, Bid Analysis/Technical Reviews, Technical Submittal and request for Information Reviews, Easement Acquisition Services, AutoCAD Drafting, Surveying, Easement Legal Descriptions, Trouble Shooting, Maintenance and Testing Specifications, and Fiber Optic Cable System Design.\nIt is necessary to award this contract work to two firms.  Plan reviews and other such work cannot be performed by the firm that developed the plans as that is a conflict of interest.  Awarding two firms gives a contracted firm to perform work that would be a conflict of interest for the primary firm. \nThis work will be performed in Columbus Community “99 - Citywide.”\nTIMELINE:  Both contracts have a three year project assignment window starting upon the date the Notice To Proceed is issued.  Work will be completed upon all projects assigned as contract work during this three year window until the project work is complete and accepted by the City.  No new projects will be assigned after the three year assignment window expires.  There are two planned modifications to add funding for future years of the contract. \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT: There will be two contracts awarded with $650,000.00 being the initial amount with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & Dehaven, Inc., and $100,000.00 the initial amount with G-A-I Consultants, Inc.  Future contract modifications are planned to add funding as needs dictate.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                                                $ 750,000.00 \nFuture Anticipated Needs                                          $1,500,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                               $2,250,000.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis is a contract for supplemental engineering services for the Division of Power’s various CIP projects such as studies required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (PERRP), and to reduce the backlog of DOP’s routine engineering needs.  As such, it will not have any economic impact but it will include community outreach if it is used for projects that typically solicit input from the community.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\n This project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from 8/15/2025 through 9/12/2025.   Five proposals were received:\n \nName                                                    C.C.
