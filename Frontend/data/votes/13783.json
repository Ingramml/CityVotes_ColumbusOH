    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Travco Construction, Inc., hereafter referred to as Travco, for the Lead Service Line Replacement - Pilot Program contract, CIP #690236-100178, in an amount up to $500,000.00. \n \nThe water distribution system is comprised of service lines owned by the City on the public side, and by individual property owners on the private side.  The public side includes the part of the service line installed within the public right-of-way, and the private side includes the part of the service line running from the end of the public right-of-way to the structure on the property.  The City excluded lead as an approved material for service lines in 1963.  However, lead service lines currently exist in both the public and private side of the City service lines due to installation prior to the exclusion.  The public health and safety is endangered by the ingestion of drinking water that contains lead.   The use of a lead service line to deliver drinking water from a water main to a residence, business, school, or other building or structure, increases the risk of lead content in the water.  The continued use of lead service lines for an indefinite period of time, without a systematic plan for replacing those lead lines, is a threat to the health and safety of the utility customers as well as the residents, occupants, and visitors to the City.  \n \nThe US EPA mandated that lead water lines be removed from a utility’s water distribution system and that the utility is responsible for replacing both the private and public parts of the lead water lines.  Within the City’s water distribution system, the property owner is responsible for the private part of the water line and the Department of Public Utilities does not perform work on the private part.  Ordinance 1648-2024, passed by City Council on 6/24/24, authorized the establishment of a Lead Service Line Replacement - Pilot Program project so the Department of Public Utilities could learn about replacing lead water lines on private property and develop policies, procedures, rules, and regulations concerning the replacement of those lines.  This contract modification will provide funding to finish replacing the lead water lines for Columbus residents that volunteered to participate in the pilot program.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 Citywide.\n \n1.1  TIMELINE:  The original project timeline is still in effect.  All work shall be complete within 730 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The City issued a Notice to Proceed on January 15, 2025. \n \n1.2 ESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The project cost, including grant funding, will be $4,500,000 after this contract modification is executed.\n \nCost summary: \nOriginal Contract (ORD 1648-2024, PO461754, PO461769)                      $     2,500,000.00\nH2Ohio Grant (ORD 1693-2025)                                                                                    $        500,000.00\nModification No. 1 ( ORD 1748-2025, PO524978)                                        $     1,000,000.00\nModification No. 2 (Current)                                                                                    $        500,000.00          \nTOTAL                                                                                                                $      4,500,000.00\n                     \nNo future modifications are anticipated \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used\nThis contract was awarded through the City’s bid process.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe additional funds provided for the project will permit the contractor to continue replacing lead or galvanized taps and private service lines.  This will assist the Division of Water in meeting OEPA requirements regarding lead.  This work will be performed on an “as-needed” basis at miscellaneous locations directed by the City, and will remain within the original scope of the contract.  Community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nTravco’s contract compliance number is CC009944 and expires 9/3/26.\n \nTravco has proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                           City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nDecker Construction Company                     Columbus, OH                                       MAJ\nBiz Tech DBA Tatum Landscaping              Columbus, OH                                       MBE\n & Lawncare LLC\nCLB Trucking, Inc.                                      Columbus, OH                                       MBE\n \nThe certification of Travco and the above companies was in good standing at the time the of this contract modification.\n \n4. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nTravco and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $500,000.00 are available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects.  \n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance so water lines containing lead and/or galvanized material may be remedied as soon as possible, eliminating this public health hazard\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to add funding for the Lead Service Line Replacement - Pilot Program project with Travco; to authorize an amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the Water Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
