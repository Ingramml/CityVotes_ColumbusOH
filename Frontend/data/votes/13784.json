    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Ordinance 2845-2024, as amended by Ordinance 3393-2024, authorized the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute a Subrecipient Agreement - Not-For-Profit Service Contract with the Human Service Chamber Foundation. This contract authorized the Foundation to implement an energy audit and technical assistance program funded by the City’s US Department of Energy (US DOE) Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG grant) award. \n \nAs the Human Service Chamber is no longer able to execute the program or enter into the Subrecipient Agreement - Not-For-Profit Service Contract, the City seeks approval to subaward the grant to the Columbus Region Green Fund.\n \nEmergency Justification:\nEmergency action of this ordinance is requested because the program needs to be completed within the performance period of the US DOE Assistance Agreement, which ends in July of 2026. An extension may be requested but progress must be demonstrated. \n \nFiscal Impact\nThis ordinance will approve a new subrecipient for a US DOE EECBG grant currently appropriated to the Public Utilities Electricity Grant Fund 6316 in the amount of $778,900.
