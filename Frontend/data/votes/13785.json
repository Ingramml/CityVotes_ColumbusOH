With the removal of existing material and upgrade to current lighting standards, the project will provide the community with more reliable lighting, as the existing material is dated, and eliminate repeated maintenance issues.  The project will also upgrade the lighting to LED, which has proven to be more energy efficient.  This will result in energy consumption savings for the City of Columbus.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Columbus Community “57 - Mid East.”\n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 365 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City. The Notice To Procced (NTP) is anticipated to be issued around March 11, 2026, based on typical project schedules and timelines.    The estimated ending month and year of the design is March, of 2027.  However, the contract will not terminate until the project is constructed and accepted by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF CONTRACT:  The negotiated professional services agreement amount is $354,747.63, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, design exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                                                                                             $ 354,747.63\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                                                                       $          0.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                               $ 354,747.63\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe removal of existing material and upgrade to current lighting standards will provide the community with more reliable lighting as the existing material is dated and presents repeated maintenance issues.  The project will also upgrade the lighting to LED, which has proven to be more energy efficient.  This will result in energy consumption savings for the City of Columbus. .  \n \n3.  PROPOSAL INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened March 28, 2025.   Two proposals were received:\n \nName                                                                                                                                                   C.C.
