    "description": "Explanation                     \n1.  BACKGROUND\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract through the City’s IFB process with The Safety Company, LLC for the purchase of a TV and Cutter Truck for $507,000.00.  \n \nThis truck will be used by Sewer Maintenance Operation Center crews for viewing and cutting inside underground pipes throughout the City.  This truck was included in the 2025 capital budget plan. This purchase has been approved by the Division of Fleet Management.\n \nThe Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids for the TV and Cutter Truck in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding (RFQ031223).  Seventy bidders were solicited and four bids were received and opened on October 9, 2025.\n \n    Name                                          Bid Amount________City/State                   Status                     \nBEC Enterprises, LLC               $424,989.91                        Evansville, IN                 MAJ\nThe Safety Company, LLC         $507,000.00                    West Jefferson, OH            MAJ\nC&S Solutions, Inc.                   $525,000.00                        Harrison, OH                   MAJ\nBest Equipment Company          $579,484.75                        Indianapolis, IN                MAJ\n \nThe apparent low bidder, BEC Enterprises did not meet all specifications, therefore, The Safety Company, LLC’s bid was evaluated and deemed the lowest, best, most responsive bid. \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe Safety Company, LLC’s contract compliance number is 002197 and expired 9/16/24.\n \nThe certification of The Safety Company, LLC is not in good standing at the time of the contract award due to expired contract compliance.  Contract compliance will need to be renewed before a contract can be issued.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \n3. FISCAL IMPACT\nThe 2025 Capital Improvement Budget will need to be amended to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to finalize the contracts for this equipment as soon as possible because of the current volatile pricing and long lead times for this type of purchase, as a delay in finalizing the contracts will result in expired quotes and an increase in the price of the equipment.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to establish a contract with The Safety Company, LLC for the purchase of a TV and Cutter Truck for the Department of Public Utilities; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $507,000.00 from the Sanitary Bond Fund to pay for this purchase; and to declare an emergency.
