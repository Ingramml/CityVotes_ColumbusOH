    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the not-for-profit contract for the Sustainable Columbus Climate Action Plan Update with Power a Clean Future Ohio. The existing contract expires on December 31, 2025.\nThe update to the Columbus Climate Action Plan (CAP) will build on the city’s ongoing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen community resilience. The work will focus on three key areas: emissions modeling and analysis, development of the updated CAP and 2025 overview, and engagement with city departments and partners. The emissions modeling and analysis will form the foundation of the update by providing the data and insights needed for informed decision-making. This process will include reviewing previous plans and existing data, analyzing trends across sectors, and forecasting future emissions using ICLEI’s ClearPath tool. The team will identify opportunities for reducing emissions in specific sectors and align Columbus’ goals with regional efforts such as the Central Ohio Climate Action Plan (COCAP). Where useful, detailed data and modeling results will be included as an appendix to the updated CAP to promote transparency and understanding. The updated Climate Action Plan and executive summary will provide a clear roadmap for how Columbus will continue to advance its climate goals, highlighting key accomplishments, updated targets, and new strategies for 2025. The plan will include accessible visuals, case studies, and implementation timelines, as well as equity considerations and a framework to track progress over time. Power a Clean Future Ohio (PCFO) will collaborate with the City of Columbus to refine and format the plan, ensuring it effectively communicates the city’s climate progress and vision for the future.\nIn addition to the technical and planning work, the project will include strong engagement with city departments and partners to ensure successful implementation. PCFO will facilitate meetings with internal stakeholders to strengthen collaboration, clarify roles, and develop shared strategies for reducing emissions. Educational materials will be created to help city staff understand the impacts of climate change and the actions they can take to support the plan’s goals. As needed, PCFO will also participate in community and partner meetings organized by the city to support broader engagement efforts. The project will take place from October 2024 through May 2026, with key milestones tied to data analysis, plan development, and stakeholder review. Beyond reducing emissions, this work will have important economic, environmental, and community benefits-helping Columbus identify cost-effective sustainability investments, fostering inclusive community participation, and advancing the city’s leadership in addressing climate change.\nThis Ordinance authorizes the contract’s first modification and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n1.                     Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification is $0.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $18,565.00.\n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen: There are no additional funds needed, only a time extension is needed for this modification. The new contract expiration date is May 31st, 2026. \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used: Starting the contract anew would cause unnecessary delays. \n4.                       How was cost determined: n/a\nPrincipal Parties: \nPower a Clean Future Ohio \n1145 Chesapeake Ave, Suite I\nColumbus, OH 43212\nCassandra Clevenger, (419) 303-7388\nContract Compliance Number: 047010\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: PENDING UPDATE \nFiscal Impact:  No fiscal action is needed at this time. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to extend the contract with Power a Clean Future Ohio for the Sustainable Columbus Climate Action Plan Update.
