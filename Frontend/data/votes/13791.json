    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify a contract for the 2022 Utility Cut Restoration Project with Decker Construction Company for the Division of Water; to extend the contract through June 30, 2026; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "...Background\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing contract for 2022 Utility Cut Restoration Project with Decker Construction Company to extend the contract to June 30, 2026 as the current contract expires December 31, 2025 and will need to be re-bid. Various types of utility excavations are performed within the City of Columbus' right-of-way and City owned properties by the Department of Public Utilities.  The restoration work typically involves repair of existing pavement, curbs, and sidewalks in a manner conforming to the City of Columbus, Construction and Material Specifications (CMSC).  The Department routinely outsources this restoration work to a contractor that is equipped and trained to make these repairs.  Typical types of restoration work that require outsourcing involve the installation of wheelchair ramps, asphalt repair involving thermal bond heat weld repairs, asphalt milling machines capable of full width milling, and the delivery of flowable controlled density fill using volumetric mixer trucks.\n \nCONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The Director of Public Utilities publicly opened one bid (RFQ023112) on November 9, 2022 from Decker Construction Company. \n \nDecker Construction Company's bid was deemed the lowest, most responsive and responsible bid.  Their Contract Compliance Number is #004549 (expires 11/3/2025, Majority). The contract contains a multi-year renewal option.\n \nOrdinance No 3224-2022 authorized the original contract. Ordinance No 0246-2025 authorized a new contract waiving competitive bidding of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code. Services under the original contract cover a one (1) year period from date of execution with the option to renew annually for an additional three (3) years on a year-to-year basis, or a portion thereof, based on mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds and approval of Columbus City Council. This contract extension is for the continuation of the Utility Cut Contract through June 30, 2026. Total amount is $5,230,000.00. This contract shall not automatically renew. All other terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Decker Construction Company.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes a modification and extension of the contract and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: No additional funds are required for this extension request. \n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen: N/A\n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used: Regular procurement processes were originally utilized and this is for a modification and extension. The waiver from the previous ordinance was because of uncertainty on the duration allowed.\n4.   How was cost determined: The modification is based upon estimated requirements for early 2026 at rates established in the existing contract.\n \nEmergency Justification: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow for the contract extension before the December 31, 2025 expiration. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Additional funding is not needed. A contract extension through June 30, 2026 is being requested as this contract will need to be re-bid.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify a contract for the 2022 Utility Cut Restoration Project with Decker Construction Company for the Division of Water; to extend the contract through June 30, 2026; and to declare an emergency.
