    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify contracts with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC, in order to pay surcharges passed along from the suppliers. Proper documentation was received and approved by Purchasing and the Department of Public Service. \n \nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Division, has placed orders with several vendors for different types of equipment over the past three years, however due to the long lead times for production and delivery in the post-pandemic market place, many surcharges are being assessed by the manufacturers and their suppliers. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify the existing contracts to add the surcharges of up to $188,670.00 for the trucks. The Department of Public Service feels these changes are acceptable considering the supply chain issues and increased material costs therein, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the vehicles offered by the contracted vendor will meet the needs of the Department of Public Service, and maintain the replacement of aged vehicles in the Division of Refuse Collection’s fleet.   The following vehicles were assessed surcharges:\n \nPO338089 - Six (6) Mack/Curbtender 24-Yard Automated Side Loading Trucks:       \nOriginal Cost $389,500.00 + Surcharge $31,445 = New Cost $420,945.00\n \nSurcharge Total = $188,670.00\n \nColumbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC: Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement, PA005650, Ordinance 3096-2021, for Automated Side Loading Trucks.\n \nColumbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for the vendor:\nColumbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC is CC008547 and expires 12/10/2026.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are budgeted and available for this expenditure from the Division of Refuse Collection Bond Fund 7703.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe department requests emergency designation so this equipment can be put into service as quickly as possible to prevent interruption to, or disruption of, the Division of Refuse Collection operations. \n \n \nTitle \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to modify contracts with Columbus Truck & Equipment Center LLC; to allow for raw material and labor surcharges of up to $188,670.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $188,670.00 from the Division of Refuse Collection Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
