CSB will administer financial assistance and provide program oversight administration as the services cannot be provided by existing city employees.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the ESG portion of the 2025 Action Plan per ordinance 2968-2024.\n \nEmergency Designation: An emergency exists in that it is immediately necessary to provide funding to the Community Shelter Board the funding delays have caused a negative impact within the shelters overall funding and these funds will help further support them with funds for already vulnerable population. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding for this agreement in the amount of $35,726.23 is supported by the 2024 Emergency Solutions Grant (G442304) and the $657,093.00 is supported by the 2025 Emergency Solutions Grant (G442403).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004795 and expires 12/10/2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $657,093.00 of the FY 2025 Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) as well as the transfer of appropriation and the expenditure in an amount up to $35,726.23 of the FY 2024 Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the Department of Development; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement - Not for Profit Service Contract in an amount up to $692,819.23 with the Community Shelter Board for the administration of the City's Emergency Solutions Grant monies; to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages residents as it is an operational cost associated with shelters and these expenditures are only reimbursable beginning with the effective date of this ordinance; to authorize the payment of expenditures prior to the start of the purchase order beginning July 1, 2025; and to declare an emergency.
