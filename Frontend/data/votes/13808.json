An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Evolved Plumbing and Mechanical LLC, vendor number 030026 and contract compliance expires 8/20/26.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify a contract in an amount up to $160,000.00 with Evolved Plumbing and Mechanical LLC as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair program; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $160,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
