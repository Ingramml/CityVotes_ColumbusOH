    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with LifeCare Alliance an amount up to $50,000.00 to administer the CHORES home repair program on behalf of the City of Columbus.\n \nOriginal Contract                                           $160,000.00                     Ord. 1012-2025                                          PO515318\nModification No. 4 amount                     $  50,000.00\nTotal contract amount                                          $210,000.00        \n \nLifeCare Alliance is a non-profit organization that provides home repair services to low/moderate income and area median income residents.  Residents eligible for the program will consist of elderly (over 60 years old) or disabled AND 80% Low Moderate Income (LMI). Eligible households include families/households earning 80% or less of the area median income (AMI) as determined annually by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger families/households. \n \nLifeCare Alliance is responsible for general program administration, advertising, customer relations, applicant screening and qualification, project management, contractor oversight and reporting.  Examples of responsibilities include, but are not limited to, intake, income qualification verification, and retention of licensed contractors to perform minor electrical, carpentry, plumbing, and masonry repairs. \n \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees as they are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA)/Request for Proposal (RFP) for the CHORES program from February 13, 2025, through March 7, 2025, on the City’s Vendor Services and Bonfire websites.  The proposals were evaluated and scored in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes and a contract was awarded to LifeCare Alliance.  \n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of additional funding to be expended under this modification is $50,000.00.\n2.                     The need for additional services was unforeseen at the time the initial contract was awarded as unparalleled funding shortfalls have been felt across the community; legislative modification is required by operation of C.C. 329.09(b).\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to continue with LifeCare Alliance’s current contract to provide home repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s CHORES home repair program, as to not interrupt current services.  \n4.                     Pricing and terms will remain the same as the original contract.  \nEmergency action is requested to continue performing needed repairs for residents as quickly as possible.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Department’s Business Tax Incentive fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  LifeCare Alliance, vendor number 006078 and contract compliance expires 9/25/27.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with LifeCare Alliance an amount up to $50,000.00 to administer the CHORES home repair program on behalf of the City of Columbus; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $50,000.00 from the Housing Business Tax Incentive fund; and to declare an emergency.
