    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The Department of Development seeks to enter into a professional service contract for the purpose of conducting an assessment of the Columbus historic preservation code, policies and procedures in an amount up to $150,000.00. In addition to the assessment, the work completed through this contract will provide guidance and recommendations to modernize historic preservation in Columbus to support future historic preservation, equitable development and production of affordable housing. \nBy way of this ordinance, the director seeks to encumber the planned funds from the 2025 operating budget to enter into a contract for the services mentioned above with a to-be-determined firm.  The department is currently engaged in the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, but the process will not be completed, nor legislation ready, before City Council’s last meeting in 2025. It is estimated that the contractor will be selected in January 2026 and that the work will be completed within 6 months of agreement start date.  After review of the proposals, the Director will seek Council’s approval for the contract with the designated vendor.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to prevent delays to the department’s historic preservation assessment and to utilize the 2025 General Funds in which this contract was budgeted.  \n \nFiscal Impact: The funding of $150,000.00 is available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to encumber funds for a contract to conduct a historic preservation assessment in an amount up to $150,000.00 with a to-be-determined firm; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure in an amount up to $150,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
