    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the Architect-of-Record Services agreement, with Moody Nolan, Inc., for the New Municipal Court Building project, in the amount of $1,646,605.00.\n \nThe original agreement (PO397905), in the amount of $896,240.00, established the initial Architect-of-Record Services agreement and was authorized by Ordinance No. 1248-2023, and approved by City Council on May 22, 2023. \n \nModification No. 1, in the amount of $3,493,584.59, established schematic design services and was authorized by Ordinance No. 1984-2024, and approved by City Council on July 29, 2024.\n \nModification No. 2, in the amount of $12,594,678.11, established design development and construction documents and was authorized by Ordinance No. 1775-2025, and approved by City Council on July 14, 2025.\n \nModification No. 3 (current), in the amount of $1,646,605.00, will provide design development and construction documents for a bridge and connector for the new Municipal Court Building, as well as assistance in the bidding phases.\n \n2. MODIFICATION INFO:\n \nA.  The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification:  $1,646,605.00  \n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $     896,240.00                     (PO397905)\nModification No. 1:                     $  3,493,354.59                     (PO469787)\nModification No. 2:                     $12,594,678.11                     (PO521537)\nModification No. 3 (current):                     $  1,646,605.00\nTotal (Original and Mods 1-2):                     $16,984,272.70\n \nB. Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.  \nModifications to the contract were foreseen and indicated in the original legislation under Ord. 1248-2023 as well as Modification No. 1 under Ord. 1984-2024, and Modification No. 2 under Ord. 1775-2025.  \n \nC. Why it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?\nDue to the scale of the project, it would not be prudent to bring on a new vendor as time and project costs would increase to bringing them up to speed.\n \nD.  How the price for the additional goods or services which are subject of the modification was determined. \nThe City received a quote from Moody Nolan, Inc. and was approved by the City’s project manager.\n \n3.
