The contract will not automatically renew and is subject to funds availability and approval of Columbus City Council. Ohio Technical Services will adhere to Code Section 329.18(c) (8) regarding payment of a responsible wage.\nBids were solicited via RFQ026935 and the City received one bid on March 13, 2024.  Ohio Technical Service was the sole responder to the bid.  \n \nGiven the timing and the criticality of this service, a waiver of the bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is requested.\n \nEmergency action is requested to ensure that hazardous materials contract may be immediately available for services as soon as practical.  The previous contract expired in March 2025.  As such, no contract exists that provides this critical service.\n \nOhio Technical Services, Inc.

($130,000.00)  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Facilities Management Division to contract for inspection, testing, removal, and/or remediation of hazardous materials for facilities under the purview of the Facilities Management Division; and\n \nWHEREAS, formal bids were solicited and one vendor submitted a response; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Technical Services, Inc. was deemed the most responsive, and responsible bidder; and\n \nWHEREAS, a waiver of the bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Section 329 is requested for this contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Finance and Management Department, Facilities Management Division, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract with Ohio Technical Services, Inc. for inspection, testing, removal, and/or remediation of hazardous materials for facilities under the purview of the Facilities Management Division, to ensure that hazardous materials can be tested for and remediated at various City facilities. The previous contract expired in March 2025 and, as such, no contract currently exists to provide this critical service, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to enter into a contract on behalf of the Facilities Management Division with Ohio Technical Services, Inc. for inspection, testing, removal, and/or remediation of hazardous materials for facilities under the purview of the Facilities Management Division.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $130,000.00, or so much thereof that may be necessary in regard to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is hereby authorized in the General Fund 1000, in Object Class 03 - Contractual Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.
