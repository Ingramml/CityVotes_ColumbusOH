    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute contracts with numerous profit, not-for-profit, and social service agencies to assist the Department of Development in administering the Accelerate Columbus 2026 program through December 31, 2026. \n \nThrough Accelerate Columbus, the City seeks to nurture a pipeline of entrepreneurs, small businesses, and non-profit organizations that reflects the talent, services, and diversity of Columbus. The ultimate objective of Accelerate Columbus is to provide structured, qualitative, and quantitative measurable programs for Columbus entrepreneurs, small businesses, and non-profits that strengthen the City’s entrepreneurial ecosystem. In alignment with the Columbus Small Business Agenda, Accelerate Columbus seeks to further assist businesses in low- to moderate-income areas.\n \nIn 2019, the City of Columbus launched the Accelerate Columbus program as part of a branded set of small business training, technical assistance, mentoring, and advisement programs targeting aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners. Initially offered as a pilot program, the purpose was to provide structured, on-demand training, one-on-one advisement, and technical assistance to both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs and small businesses by addressing gaps identified in the City’s Small Business Ecosystem Assessment and the resulting Columbus Small Business Agenda.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA)/Request for Proposal (RFP) from June 5, 2025, through June 27, 2025, on the City’s Vendor Services and Bonfire websites.  The City received forty (40) proposals.  Proposals were evaluated and scored in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  The Director of Development desires to enter into a service contract with 14 of the 40 offerors. Of these 14, five are non-profit agencies and nine are for-profit companies.  All contractors shall provide a range of small-business training and technical assistance programs under Accelerate Columbus. \n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delay in administering the Accelerate Columbus 2026 program service.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these contracts has been allocated within the Economic Development Division’s General Fund budget, up to $889,739.50, and the Income Tax Set Aside (ITSA) Subfund, in an amount up to $428,579.72. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: See attached Exhibit A for a list of the for-profit, not-for-profit, and social service agencies and the vendor registration and contract compliance data.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute contracts with numerous for-profit, not-for-profit, and social service agencies in an amount up to $1,318,319.22 for the purpose of assisting the Department of Development to administer the Accelerate Columbus program; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of funds an amount up to $428,579.72 within the Income Tax Set Aside Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $889,739.50 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
