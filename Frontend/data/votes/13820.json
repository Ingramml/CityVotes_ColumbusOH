    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to support the Greenways Improvements 2025 Project.\n \nThe Olentangy and Scioto Greenway Trails are two of Columbus' most heavily used recreational corridors, serving over 1,000 users daily and connecting key destinations throughout the Columbus area. Many trail segments are more than 20 years old and nearing the end of their service life. These segments have surface deterioration and safety hazards such as root upheavals, cracking, and ponding. This project will rehabilitate approximately 1.93 miles of trail, including 1.54 miles along the Olentangy Greenway and 0.39 miles along the Scioto Trail. This project addresses five high-priority sections, including the Olentangy Trail at Antrim Park, the Olentangy Trail near the Ohio State University Wetlands, the Olentangy Trail at Tuttle Park, the Olentangy Trail from 3rd Avenue to Goodale Street, and  the Scioto Trail from State Route 33 to Confluence Park.\n \nPlanned improvements include asphalt surface enhancements, as well as, the replacement of wayfinding signage and pavement markings. Tree clearing is also needed to improve visibility and safety of trail users while proving access for asphalt trucks to get to the construction areas. These targeted repairs will extend the pavement’s service life and enhance user comfort. This project will provide full depth and partial depth pavement improvements in these high priority areas. \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department applied through a special solicitation from the Ohio Department of Transportation for the Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP). This application was successful  and was awarded $435,931.86 in federal funds in October 2025. Project funding will consist of 80% TAP funds and a 20% local match.\n \nThis project has been prioritized through the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Greenways Safety and Stabilization Program. This annual trail improvement program uses condition and usage data to identify trail segments most in need of improvements. With ODOT support, the Recreation and Parks Department can complete all five critical trail segments rather than only two initially planned. This project will ensure safer, more accessible, and longer-lasting trails for the 28,000 residents living within a 10-minute walk of the project area and the broader Central Ohio Community. Bidding this project for construction in the second quarter of 2026.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources (ODOT), District 6\n400 East William Street \nDelaware, Ohio 43015 \nMichele Risko, LPA Manager, (740) 833-8397, michele.risko@dot.ohio.gov\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will enhance safety, accessibility, and comfort for thousands of trail users while extending the lifespan of two major greenway trails.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: 311 reports were used to support the justification of trail section priorities for this project. A 30 day public comment period will be required as part of the federal grant process, which will be another opportunity for the public to share their input.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by addressing the safety and life cycle extension of park assets and trails. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $435,931.86 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once the project is ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to support the Greenways Improvements 2025 Project  and accept a grant in the amount of $435,931.86; and to authorize the appropriation of $435,931.86 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.
