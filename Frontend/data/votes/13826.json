    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract through the City’s RFP process with Arcadis US, Inc. for professional engineering services for the Jackson Pike Water Reclamation Plant (JPWRP) Dewatering Improvements project, CIP #650246-100001, in an amount up to $3,132,414.00. \n \nThis contract is necessary to ensure continued operation of the dewatering centrifuges at the JPWRP. The plant will become non-compliant without the dewatering centrifuges as they provide the primary means of removing solids to the various disposal outlets. Recent electrical equipment failures have necessitated acceleration of this capital project to a CMAR delivery model to complete the improvements as expeditiously as possible.\n \nThis contract is for preliminary design, detailed design, and services during construction to replace existing problematic sludge dewatering centrifuges, feed pumps, cake pumps, electrical gear, and supporting equipment at JPWRP.  The work will include select building improvements to increase resiliency of the dewatering and thickening systems. The work will also evaluate side stream nutrient removal to improve treatment capacity at JPWRP and improve biosolids nutrient composition for more land application opportunity. \n \nTwo planned contract modifications to add funding are anticipated. One modification is planned at the completion of design development and a second is planned for services during construction.\n \nThe Columbus Community is 99 - Citywide.\nTIMELINE: The contract is expected to begin in January 2026 and expected to complete preliminary design in 13 months.  CMAR procurement and step 2 services will be acquired before the end of step 1 to begin coordination of the detailed design components.  Step 2 services are planned to last through February 2028.  Step 3 services will be started in March 2028 and construction will continue until construction is completed and accepted by the City, which is planned to be August 2029. \n \nESTIMATED COST OF CONTRACT: The proposed award amount is $3,132,414.00, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work. Future contract modifications are anticipated.\n                     \n         Original Contract (current)           $3,132,414.00\n                     Modification #1 (future)                                          $3,000,000.00\n                     Modification #2 (future)                                          $3,000,000.00                 \n         CONTRACT TOTAL                 $9,132,414.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project is essential for the continued successful operation of JPWRP.  A failure of the dewatering system would put the facility out of compliance, negatively impact the Scioto River, and prevent new construction from occurring in the City as OEPA will not permit new construction without sufficient wastewater treatment capacity.  The project will utilize local labor and return funds into the local economy.\n3.
