    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Capital Electric Line Builders, LLC via the City’s Invitation For Bid process for the Smart Lighting Phase 2 LED Conversions project, C.I.P. Number 670878-100002, in an amount up to $1,337,261.54; to encumber funds for the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $1,339,261.54; to apply for, accept, and execute paperwork necessary to enter into a grant agreement with the State of Ohio Department of Development (ODOD); and to repay any unused grant funds. \n \nThe Smart Lighting Improvements Phase Two LED Conversions project will implement light emitting diode (LED) street lighting conversions in the Phase 2 project area in the southside neighborhood generally bounded by High Street on the west, Livingston Avenue on the north, Alum Creek Drive to the east, and Marion Road to the south.  LED lighting is a highly energy efficient and long lasting form of solid-state lighting that uses a semiconductor device to emit light.  Instead of a filament heating up like an incandescent bulb, a semiconductor chip emits light when an electrical current passes through it, converting electricity directly into photons with very little energy lost as heat.  The project will replace approximately 3,900 existing high pressure sodium (HPS) lights with LED.\n \nThis project is eligible for an “Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant Brightening Ohio Communities Program” grant from the United States Department of Energy through the State of Ohio Department of Development (ODOD).  These grant funds must be expended by April 15, 2026, and submitted for reimbursement in May 2026.  The grant funds will reimburse the purchase of the LED bulbs used on the project, but only those installed by April 15, 2026.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Columbus Community - 63 - South Side.\n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 365 days from the date that a Notice To Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.  \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $1,337,261.54, that includes a 15% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  A contract modification to add funding will be needed if any grant funds must be returned because they are not expended by April 15, 2026.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract                                                                    $           1,337,261.54\n                     Prevailing Wage                                                          $                 2,000.00\n                     Future Anticipated Needs                                             $                       0.00\n                             CONTRACT TOTAL                                         $           1,339,261.54\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe installation and conversion to LED lighting within the project area would provide both an additional sense of safety and security to the residents.  This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  The Division of Power will have significant energy savings from the conversion to LED from high pressure sodium street lights.  \n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from September 25, 2025, through October 20, 2025.   Six bids were received:\n \n___Name                                                                                         Bid Amount                                             _City/State                                                                Status\nCapital Electric Line Builders                                           $1,337,261.54                                           Parkville, MO                                                          MAJ\nComplete General Construction                                      $1,420,790.50                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                MAJ\nAsplund Construction, LLC                                                $1,426,885.00                                           Columbus, Ohio                                                MAJ\nDanbert Electric Corp                                                                $1,641,487.58                                            Plain City, Ohio                                                      MAJ\nMiller Cable Company                                                               $1,940,496.95                                           Green Springs, Ohio                                          MAJ\nProLine Electric Inc                                                                    $4,971,745.04                                              Lancaster, Ohio                                                     MAJ\n \nCapital Electric Line Builders’ bid was evaluated and deemed the lowest, best, most responsive bid.  \n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nCapital Electric Line Builders’ contract compliance number is CC-008916 and expires 8/25/27.  \n \nCapital Electric Line Builders plans to do this work without the use of subcontractors.\n \nThe certification of the Capital Electric Line Builders was in good standing at the time that bids were due.\n \n5.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nCapital Electric Line Builders has met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $936,690.54 is budgeted, available, and appropriated within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303. \n \nPartial funding for this project will be provided by a reimbursable grant in the amount of $402,571.00.  The grant is an Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant Brightening Ohio Communities Program grant from the United States Department of Energy through the State of Ohio Department of Development (ODOD), Fund 6316, Grant #TBD.
