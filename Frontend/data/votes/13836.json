This team will assist the city’s most vulnerable population in finding safe, secure, appropriate, and stable living environments tailored to their needs. In addition, the specialist will connect them with physical and behavioral healthcare needs. \n \nThis program is intended to be funded annually through December 31, 2029 with this organization based on funding availability from both the HOME-ARP grant as well as other city funding sources.   This initiative is not just about addressing immediate needs but fostering long-term stability and wellness for Columbus’ most vulnerable residents.  Focusing on addressing the root causes of homelessness and supporting successful transitions into stable housing, the program aims to create a brighter future for this community.  \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME-ARP Allocation Plan portion of the City’s 2021 HUD Annual Action Plan which was amended, per Ordinance 0459-2023.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is necessary to ensure the CORE Team can begin providing services before winter weather, immediately supporting unsheltered residents with the highest needs.\n \nThese agreements are in accordance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 that relate to not-for-profit service contracts and grants.  The services included in the not-for-profit agreement cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide. \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is CC-004267 and expires on 09/26/2026 \n \nFiscal Impact: $264,000.00 is available from and within the HOME-ARP grant (G442101) and $21,1500.00 is available from and within the Income Tax Set Aside (ITSA) Subfund 100099.\n \n \nTitle\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure in an amount up to $264,000.00 of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME-ARP) funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Subrecipient Not For Profit Service Contract with Maryhaven Inc., in an amount up to $264,000.00 to establish a team of engagement specialists to provide supportive services for those that are deemed eligible under the HOME-ARP guidelines; authorizes the appropriation and expenditure in an amount up to $21,150.00 within the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund; authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Maryhaven Inc., in an amount up to $21,150.00 to provide operational support; authorizes food and non-alcoholic beverages to be considered an operational cost of this non-profit organization; authorizes the expenditures prior to the purchase order beginning December 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029; to authorize the advancement of a portion of the grant agreement in a predetermined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
