    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation shall authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify existing revenue contracts and renegotiate payment amounts and terms with five vendors providing concession services at Columbus Recreation and Parks operated golf courses.\n \nConcession Services are a key component of our Golf Courses. They attract new and existing customers, enhance the golf course experience by providing food and beverages for the customers, and generate revenue for the department to supplement day-to-day operations.\n \nThe five contracts to be modified and approved are the following:\n1.         Ruthfield Enterprises LLC for the provision of concession services at Airport Golf Course\n2.                     Fore Hospitality, LLC for the provision services at Champions Golf Course\n3.         Vittorio Investments, Inc for the provision of concession services at Mentel Memorial Golf Course\n4.         DONN Hospitality LLC for the provision of concession services at Raymond Memorial Golf Course\n5.                     Lill’s Concessions LLC for the provision of concession services at Turnberry Memorial Golf Course\n                     \nThese are revenue generating contracts for the Golf Division. In compliance with City Code 913.02 (B)(3)(d)(2) four original contracts were approved by the Recreation and Parks Commission on December 12, 2023 (Airport, Mentel Memorial, Raymond Memorial, and Turnberry Golf Courses) and one (1) on February 27, 2024 (Champions Golf Course) as two (2) year agreements with an option to renew for three (3) additional 2-year terms. This renewal will be the first of the three (3).\n \nThis legislation shall authorize the renegotiation of payment amounts and terms for the next two (2) years in Section 4, delete a duplicate paragraph, and add more specific requirements to the restroom cleaning sections 10 (A) and (B). \n \nIn compliance with City Code 329.09(a) regarding contract modifications there are no additional funds to be expended under the modifications as these are revenue generating contracts, there is no need for additional goods or services under the modifications and it would not be in the City’s best interests to have additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes as the modifications here are to clarify the contract terms.\n \nSection 10(A) will have the addition of the following text:\na.                     The Concessionaire shall be responsible for the cleaning of the public restrooms three (3) times per week during the In-Season (April 1st through October 31st). \nb.                     During the Off-Season (November 1st-March 31st), the Concessionaire shall be responsible for the cleaning of the public restrooms one (1) time each week. The Golf Professional on site may exercise oversite of the Concessionaire and deem Off-Season cleaning unnecessary should business be limited. \nc.                     The Concessionaire may use in-house labor or contract a custodial service. \nd.                     Should the Concessionaire fail to meet an acceptable standard of cleanliness in the public restrooms, the City reserves the right to contract custodial service and invoice the Concessionaire for all fees.\ne.                     Outside of the normal cleaning schedule, restroom cleaning will be the responsibility of the golf course staff. \n \nThe following text will be removed from Section 10(B), second paragraph:\nCleaning, housekeeping and general maintenance of the structures, including all public areas associated with the Contract, shall be performed by the Concessionaire daily. The Concessionaire shall be responsible for providing all cleaning supplies and consumable items associated with normal maintenance including, but not limited to paper towels, soap, toilet tissue and light bulbs.\n \nPrincipal Parties:\n \nRuthfield Enterprises LLC\n10368 Shipley Rd Johnstown, OH 43031 Pete Rodgers, 614-545-8467\nCC-002804\n \nFore Hospitality, LLC\n1317 W 3rd Ave, Columbus, OH 43212\nJennifer Miller, 614-795-2420\nCC-040502\n \nVittorio Investments, Inc\n4632 Scenic Dr. Columbus, OH 43214 Joe Vittorio, 614-313-0045\nCC-005278\n \nDONN Hospitality LLC\n684 Briggs St Columbus, OH 43206 Larry Nettles, 614-783-1794\nCC-047303\n \nLill’s Concessions LLC\n862 S Remington Rd Columbus, OH 43209 Lauren Miller, 614-288-5550\nCC-008598\n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract is necessary to provide food and beverages to the golfers and visitors at Airport, Champions, Mentel Memorial, Raymond Memorial, & Turnberry Golf Courses.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Airport, Champions, Mentel Memorial, Raymond Memorial, & Turnberry Golf Courses.\n \nMaster Plan Relation: Food Concessions are an integral part of golf course operations.
