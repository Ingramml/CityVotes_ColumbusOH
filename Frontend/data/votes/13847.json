    "title": "To authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund in support of Women's History Month. ($10,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the establishment of a general budget reservation to support expenses associated with Women's History Month. Women's History Month is an opportunity to celebrate and honor the unique historical significance of women over time, especially as it pertains to our community of Columbus. Every year, the Office of Councilmember Lourdes Barroso de Padilla coordinates an event in honor of Women's History Month. This first came out of wanting to highlight the pay equity legislation the Councilmember initially passed but has since evolved to honor the diverse contributions of local women changemakers, inspire others to create change in their own spheres of influence, and educate others on the roles women play in creating meaningful change. This will be in its 4th year and we anticipate about 200 attendees; we've found that the event connects women across industries and generations resulting in mentorship and collaboration for many.\n \nThe funds may be used for food and refreshments, venue rental space, marketing/educational materials, and any audio/visual that may be necessary. The use of funds to provide food and beverage to attendees serves a public purpose in that it increases the likelihood that residents will participate in engaging with Council.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund in support of Women's History Month. ($10,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Council prioritizes celebrating and honoring women's history; and\n \nWHEREAS, pay equity is one example of the ways in which women's history informs the need for a greater understanding of the unique challenges women have faced throughout history, including in central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council will host a women's history event during the month of March, which is nationally known as Women's History Month; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of City Council to ensure that City Council is able to adequately celebrate and honor Women's History Month in the month of March; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
