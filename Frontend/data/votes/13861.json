    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThe Department of Technology recommends a comprehensive update to three sections of the Columbus City Codes: Chapter 151 (Records Commission), Chapter 153 (Information Technology Investment and Planning Committee), and Chapter 225 (Department of Technology).\nThis combined code change package will modernize the City's information management and technology governance framework. It strengthens the Records Commission’s authority and responsibilities, formally creates the IT Investment and Planning Committee to advise citywide technology strategy, and updates the Department of Technology’s structure, leadership title, and responsibilities to reflect its growing role in service coordination and policy development.\nThese updates are necessary to ensure legal compliance, improve organizational efficiency, and enhance the City’s ability to manage digital and physical records and technology resources across all departments.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThere are no immediate capital or operating budget impacts. These code changes clarify governance authority and improve internal coordination. Over time, the changes are expected to generate operational efficiencies and support more strategic management of City resources.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Chapters 151, 153, and 225 of the Columbus City Codes to modernize the City’s information management and technology governance framework; to clarify and strengthen the responsibilities of the Records Commission; to formally establish the Information Technology Investment and Planning Committee (ITIP); and to update the organizational structure and leadership title within the Department of Technology.
