    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 0470-2023, passed May 6, 2023, authorized the City of Columbus (“CITY”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with 0 Outerbelt Street, LLC (the “ENTERPRISE”), for a real property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of approximately $30,444,390.00, which included approximately $7,000,000.00 in acquisition cost, and $23,444,390.00 in real property improvements to construct a proactive industrial facility consisting of approximately 205,000 square feet (the “PROJECT”) at or on Outerbelt Street, Columbus, Ohio 43213, and on four contiguous parcel numbers 520-143653, 520-143654, 520-143655 and 520-308803, within the City of Columbus and within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”). Additionally, the ENTERPRISE committed to create or cause to be created twenty-five (25) net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $1,040,000.00 at the PROJECT SITE. The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective June 9, 2023 with the PROJECT expected to begin approximately July 2023, with all real property improvements expected to be completed approximately by June 2024 and with the abatement to commence no later than January 1, 2025 nor extend beyond December 31, 2034 (Agreement No. 023-23-07).  \n \nAs of this date, the company has filed their DTE-24 with the Franklin County Auditor’s Office, but no Final Determination from the Ohio Department of Taxation, and so no forgone tax benefit has yet been received. \n \nParagraph fifteen within Section 8 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY” and paragraph fifteen of that same section states that “any requested amendment…to any of the terms of the AGREEMENT…shall require the payment to the CITY by the ENTERPRISE of an AMENDMENT FEE in the amount of five-hundred dollars ($500.00).”\n \nIn a letter received by the CITY on behalf of the ENTERPRISE dated October 24, 2025, through ensuing correspondence, confirmed that AH Columbus, LLC had acquired ownership of the PROJECT SITE from 0 Outerbelt Street, LLC with the transfer having been recorded at the County’s Auditor’s Office on September 18, 2025.  Additionally, the PROJECT SITE has been revised to be Parcel Number 520-143653 (combining the previous four parcel numbers into one parcel), containing approximately 31.60 +/- acres with the current street address of 392-488 Outerbelt Street, Columbus, Ohio 43213.  \n \nDue diligence has been undertaken by the CITY in that AH Columbus, LLC agreed to fully assume the terms and commitments of the ENTERPRISE pursuant to the AGREEMENT, has submitted an updated Economic Development Incentive Application, the five-hundred dollars ($500.00) Amendment Fee and that this application and all other pertinent information has been reviewed and vetted.  \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to (1) remove 0 Outerbelt Street, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with AH Columbus, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, whereby AH Columbus, LLC will assume the terms and commitments of the AGREEMENT, (2) revise the description of the PROJECT SITE, and (3) revise the notice information related to ENTERPRISE within Section 8 of the AGREEMENT.    \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement for the first time for Assignment & Assumption with 0 Outerbelt Street, LLC, to remove 0 Outerbelt Street, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with AH Columbus, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, to redefine the PROJECT SITE, and to revise the notification information.
