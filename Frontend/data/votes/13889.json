The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $29,532.00 was established.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on August 21, 2025.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Whittier Park Limited at the cost of $29,532.00 to them.\n                     \n2.
