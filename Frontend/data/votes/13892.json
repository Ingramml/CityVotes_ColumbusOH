    "title": "To amend Ordinance No. 2212-2025 to correct errors and omissions in the text used to accept various deeds for parcels of real property to be used as road right-of-way. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation \n1.  BACKGROUND\nFrom time to time, various parcels of land are deeded to the City of Columbus for public street and/or alley purposes. One such example when this occurs is streets included in the Columbus Thoroughfare Plan.  Streets listed within the Plan have a pre-defined amount of required right-of-way. If that right-of-way width is lacking for a particular property, then the additional right-of-way must be deeded to the City when that property is sold or is being redeveloped.  Another example is when developers install sidewalks, turn lanes, etc., on a property within the public right-of-way. The City requires such improvements to be located entirely within the public right-of-way. If any part of such improvements are outside of the public right-of-way, the developer must deed that part of the land to the City. Many of the deeded amounts are for very small pieces of land. All of the deeded land transactions go through the City Attorney's Office.   \nBy way of ordinance 2212-2025, the City accepted a number of deeds for this purpose.  However there were a few errors in the language of the ordinance that now require that the ordinance be amended to correct same.\n 2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no expenditure associated with this Ordinance. \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 2212-2025 to correct errors and omissions in the text used to accept various deeds for parcels of real property to be used as road right-of-way. ($0.00) \nBody \nWHEREAS, Section 191 of the City Charter requires property to be used as a public street or alley be accepted and dedicated as public right-of-way by an ordinance specially passed for such purpose; and \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus had been asked to accept various deeds for real property, to dedicate those parcels of real property for the purpose of road right-of-way, and to name said property as public roadways; and \nWHEREAS, by way of ordinance 2212-2025, the City accepted a number of deeds for this purpose; and\nWHEREAS, there were a few errors in the language of the ordinance that now require that the ordinance be amended to correct same; and\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service for the City to correct these errors in order to accept these deeds for property that will be used for road rights-of-way; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nSECTION 1.  That the background of Ordinance 2212-2025 be amended as follows:\n1.  BACKGROUND\nFrom time to time, various parcels of land are deeded to the City of Columbus for public street and/or alley purposes. One such example when this occurs is streets included in the Columbus Thoroughfare Plan.  Streets listed within the Plan have a pre-defined amount of required right-of-way. If that right-of-way width is lacking for a particular property, then the additional right-of-way must be deeded to the City when that property is sold or is being redeveloped.  Another example is when developers install sidewalks, turn lanes, etc., on a property within the public right-of-way. The City requires such improvements to be located entirely within the public right-of-way. If any part of such improvements are outside of the public right-of-way, the developer must deed that part of the land to the City. Many of the deeded amounts are for very small pieces of land. All of the deeded land transactions go through the City Attorney's Office.   \nThe Department of Public Service maintains a list of the deeded land and periodically submits the list to City Council for acceptance of the deeded land. Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03 Section 191 of the City Charter requires that property proposed for use as a public street or alley must be accepted and dedicated as public right-of-way by an ordinance specifically passed for such purpose. \nThis Ordinance provides for the City to accept deeds for various parcels of real property, to dedicate the parcels as road right-of-way, and to name the parcels as public roadways to comply with Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03 Section 191 of the City Charter. Passage of this Ordinance also exempts the property deeded to the City from property taxes.\nSECTION 2. That the recitals of Ordinance No. 2212-2025 be amended as follows:\nWHEREAS, provisions of the City Charter and Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03 Section 191 of the City Charter requires property to be used as a public street or alley be accepted and dedicated as public right-of-way by an ordinance specially passed for such purpose; and \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has been asked to accept various deeds for real property, to dedicate those parcels of real property for the purpose of road right-of-way, and to name said property as public roadways; and \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a COURT ENTRY, Benedette N Ngene Igwe has deeded property to the City of Columbus, Ohio, to be used as Cleveland Avenue right-of-way; and \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a COURT ENTRY, L&A Auto Group LLC has deeded property to the City of Columbus, Ohio, to be used as Cleveland Avenue and Hudson Street right-of-way; and \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a GENERAL WARRANTY DEED, Giuseppe A. Pingue has deeded property to the City of Columbus, Ohio, to be used as Sancus Boulevard right-of-way; and \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a COURT ENTRY, KFC US Properties INC has deeded property to the City of Columbus, Ohio, to be used as Scarborough Boulevard, Brice Road and Tussing Road right-of-way; and \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a HIGHWAY EASEMENT, NM Developer LLC has deeded property to the City of Columbus, Ohio, to be used as Spruce Street and Wall Street right-of-way; and \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a GOVERNOR’S DEED, State of Ohio has deeded property to the City of Columbus, Ohio, to be used as Sullivant Avenue right-of-way; and \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service for the City to accept these deeds for property that will be used for road rights-of-way; now, therefore\nSECTION 3.
