    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) began accepting applications for its Local Major Bridge Program on September 1, 2025, and applications were due October 15, 2025.  ODOT’s Local Major Program provides Federal funds to counties and municipalities for bridge replacement, bridge rehabilitation, major bridge preventative maintenance, and bridge demolition projects.  ODOT can cover up to 80% of eligible costs for preliminary engineering and construction.  The City of Columbus is an eligible applicant, and the Public Service Department has submitted two applications for ODOT’s review and consideration.\n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications seeking funds in relation to ODOT’s Local Major Bridge Program. This ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute project agreements for approved projects, to accept and expend grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued. Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with ODOT in connection with the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications for the projects listed below:\n \nFront Street bridge over railroad tracks and Convention Center Drive: This project includes deck overlay, parapet repairs, fence replacement, and expansion joint replacement.  The total cost is approximately $3,000,000.00 and the Department is requesting $2,400,000.00 from ODOT’s Local Major Bridge Program.\n \nParsons Avenue Over Railroad South of Hosack.  This project includes replacing the existing Parsons Avenue bridge over the railroad tracks, between Groveport Road and Hosack Street.  The total cost is approximately $15,060,000.00 and Department is requesting $12,048,000.00 from ODOT’s Local Major Bridge Program.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts, right of way acquisition, and/or construction contracts that will be submitted for Council's approval.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to enable the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with accepting ODOT funds within grant funding timelines.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation Local Major Bridge Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting for approved projects, and to declare an emergency.
