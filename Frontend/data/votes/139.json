    "description": "Title\nTo honor and recognize February as Black History Month in Columbus, Ohio\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the brainchild of historian Carter G. Woodson originally known as “Negro History Week” began 95 years ago this month as an effort to ensure the physical and intellectual survival of Black people; and\n \nWHEREAS, since Black History Month was first observed in 1970 by students and faculty at Kent State University in our own home state, the observation has continued to focus on the many contributions of African-American people to the story of our nation and the world; and \n \nWHEREAS, since President Gerald R. Ford urged all Americans in February 1976 to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history,” Black History Month has had federal recognition; and\n \nWHEREAS Lisa Evans, a 36-year employee of the Franklin County Treasurer’s Office, began coordinating a Black History potluck and celebration for her colleagues in 1999 that included traditional soul food, posters and educational information about Black history; and\n \nWHEREAS, to mark the 20th anniversary of Lisa Evans’ labor of love in 2019, Franklin County Treasurer Cheryl Brooks Sullivan hosted a communitywide Black History Month event to honor Black achievement and share African-American culture, history, music and food; and\n \nWHEREAS, there is so much Black history to celebrate in Columbus and Franklin County, whose sons and daughters have achieved, educated, advocated, innovated, entertained and enlightened both within our communities’ borders and far beyond; therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS hereby joins Franklin County Treasurer Cheryl Brooks Sullivan’s 3rd annual communitywide Black History Month celebration; and be it further",
