    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to modify a grant agreement authorized by ordinances 1390-2021, 1180-2022, and 2002-2023, with ASPYR (formerly Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio - WDBCO), to extend the agreement to December 31, 2026, and to allow them to use funds to help Columbus students to prepare for, and complete, their post-secondary education, as well as plan for their career goals.\n \nFor 33 years, I Know I Can (IKIC), a not-for-profit organization, has been the anchor organization for college access in Columbus, with recent expansion into additional Franklin County districts. IKIC achieves its mission, “to inspire, enable, and support Columbus students to pursue and complete a college education,” by focusing service efforts around three critical junctures for students: early awareness of college and career opportunities, postsecondary access, as well as summer melt prevention and postsecondary persistence. ASPYR contracted with I Know I Can to administer this initiative.\n \nDue to COVID-19, in the 2020-2021 school year, many Columbus City Schools (CCS) students had not acquired enough credits to graduate high school or matriculate to the next grade level.  Ordinance 1390-2021 provided crucial funding for Summer JAM: a collaborative initiative to assist students with acquiring high school credits and provided them summer employment and other programming.\n \nOf the $5,855,232.80 encumbered by ordinance 1390-2021, ASPYR invoiced the City for, and received $3,000,000.00. Of this, only $1,348,791.00 was spent during the initial contracted period. WDBCO retained a balance of $1,651,209.00, $500,000.00 was re-appropriated by the City and $2,355,232.00 remains encumbered at the City.\n \nORD. 1390-2021\nOriginal Grant/encumbered                                          $5,855,232.00                                          \nAmount allocated                                                                                     $3,000,000.00\nAmount spent                                                                                                         $1,348,791.00\nASPYR balance                                                         $1,651,209.00\nRe-appropriated                           $500,000.00\nEncumbered balance                                                               $2,355,232.00\n \nBecause of this, Ordinance 1180-2022 authorized the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to modify the original agreement, to increase the depth and breadth of the college and career readiness services provided to CCS classes of 2022, 2023, and 2024 as well as provide college retention support to graduates who, with ongoing pandemic concerns, were at risk for dropping out due to financial constraints, increased anxiety, and decreased motivation.\n \nThe updated terms set August 31, 2023 as the deadline for ASPYR to utilize the $1,651,209.00 in previously disbursed funds, and August 31, 2024 as the deadline to allocate the remaining $2,355,232.00 encumbered by the City. ASPYR began applying these resources toward the expanded scope of services; however, portions of both the disbursed funds and the City-encumbered funds remained unspent after August 31, 2024\n \nORD. 1180-2022\nASPYR balance                                                      $1,651,209.00\nEncumbered balance                                                               $2,355,232.00\n \nIn 2023, ASPYR again sought to modify and extend the agreement to continue the existing work and amend the scope of work to allow the outfitting a mobile service unit for postsecondary and career outreach in the Columbus community.  Ordinance 2002-2023 was approved by City Council on October 19, 2023, allowing the expanded work to continue until December 31, 2025.\n \nORD. 2002-2023\nASPYR balance                                                      $1,651,209.00\nEncumbered balance                                                               $2,355,232.00\n \nASPYR began again applying these resources toward the expanded scope of services and was able to allocate all of the previously disbursed funds and $1,000,000.00 0f the City-encumbered funds.  However, $1,355, 232.00 of the City-encumbered funds remained unspent.\n \nORD. 3243-2025\nASPYR balance                                                                  $0.00\nEncumbered balance                                                               $1,355,232.00\n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests the authority to extend the deadlines of the existing agreement to December 31, 2026, to provide ASPYR and IKIC time complete the tasks identified in the new scope of work, to allow ASPYR and IKIC to continue to work on the tasks associated with the previous scopes of work.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There is no new funding associated with this ordinance. The original funding was provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 11, 2021. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is requested to enable the work to continue and students to continue to be served.\nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to modify a grant agreement with ASPYR (formerly the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio - WDBCO), to extend the deadlines of the existing agreement authorized by Ordinance 2002-2023 to December 31, 2026;  to allow ASPYR and IKIC to continue to work on the tasks associated with previous scopes of work; and to declare an emergency.
