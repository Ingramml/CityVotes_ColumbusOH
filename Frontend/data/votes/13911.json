    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract modification with Columbus State Community College by increasing the contract, in an amount of up to $535,655.00. To that end, this ordinance also authorizes an appropriation and expenditure.\n \nThis contract was authorized by Ordinance 1490-2025, which was passed by Council on June 9, 2025. The contract provides for Columbus State Community College to provide student support services to those students enrolled in the Columbus Promise Program.\n \nTo ensure that there are sufficient funds available on the purchase order to fulfill upcoming invoices related to the spring semester, a contract modification to add funds is requested.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $535,655.00\nOriginal contract amount                                          $700,000.00                                          Ord. 1490-2025                                          \nModification No. 1 amount                                          $535,655.00\nTotal contract amount                         $1,235,655.00\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract modification was anticipated, as the full funding need of just over $1.2 million was not available at the time of the original ordinance.
