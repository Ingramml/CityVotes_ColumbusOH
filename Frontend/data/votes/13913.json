    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Highland Youth Garden, Inc., a non-profit corporation, in support of sustainable produce production and its Free Garden Markets program.  Funding can be provided on a reimbursement basis for purposes of this agreement.\n \nHighland Youth Garden involves youth and children in the process of sustainably growing significant amounts of fresh produce and distributing it to community members on the Hilltop. In 2025, it was able to triple its production record without the addition of more acreage by capitalizing on the strong expertise of a Garden Manager who joined the staff in late 2024. Past production records were limited to 4,000 pounds a year, but it has grown and distributed 12,000 pounds as of October 2025. What is needed to continue expanding this production record is sufficient funding for expert staff. The method of distribution for this produce is targeted to its USDA-designated food desert neighborhood through thrice-weekly markets. Markets are an opportunity for neighbors (including many seniors) to come together, build community, exchange recipes and learn about how to use the fresh produce that Highland Youth Garden offers. Scheduling is built to best accommodate families whose children attend Highland Elementary and the city’s Hilltop Early Learning Center who appreciate the ability to pick up produce at the same time they are picking up their children from school. A Saturday market is also appreciated by neighborhood residents who work during the week as well as seniors. Access is available to everyone without paperwork or income restrictions, but zip codes are collected to ensure that at least 85% of attendees live on the Hilltop or in Franklinton. \n \nCouncil is supporting this need for the program to last from January to November 2026.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $12,020.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is requested in order for Highland Youth Garden to obtain expert staff to execute their programming in advance of 2026.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Highland Youth Garden, Inc. in support of sustainable produce production and its Free Garden Markets program; to authorize an appropriation of $12,020.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the expenditure of $12,020.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency ($12,020.00)  \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is need to provide sustainable produce and access to food markets to those in need on the City’s West Side; and\n \nWHEREAS, Highland Youth Garden involves youth and children in the process of sustainably growing significant amounts of fresh produce and distributing it to community members on the Hilltop; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council is proposing support of $12,020.00 in support of these needs; and \n \nWHEREAS, $12,020.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Highland Youth Garden, Inc. to obtain expert staff to execute their programming of sustainably growing significant amounts of fresh produce for distribution to community members in the Hilltop neighborhood in advance of 2026, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Highland Youth Garden, Inc. in support of sustainable produce production and its Free Garden Markets program.\n \nSECTION 2.

That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
