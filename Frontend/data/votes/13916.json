    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Columbus City Attorney’s Office entered into a contract with Jwayyed Jwayyed, Attorney at Law, on March 1, 2025, to provide special prosecution services in an amount not to exceed $35,000.00. Due to the nature and complexity of the cases assigned, additional services are required beyond the scope originally anticipated. These needs could not be fully foreseen at the time of the initial contract, as the volume and duration of conflict-driven cases fluctuates based on prosecutor workload and referrals.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Attorney to modify the contract to increase the maximum term amount to $45,000.00. Continuing with the existing contractor is in the City’s best interest because the attorney has been actively engaged in the ongoing matters, is familiar with the facts and parties involved, and replacing counsel mid-representation would disrupt continuity and increase both cost and risk to the City.\n \nThe pricing for the additional services is based on the same rate structure approved in the original contract and reflects the estimated number of additional hours necessary to complete the matters currently assigned. This modification is needed to ensure uninterrupted representation and continued access to special prosecution services for apparent conflict-of-interest situations.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The amount of the contract modification is $10,000.00, and the total amount of this contract, as modified, is $45,000.00. This contract modification will be funded by the General Fund.\n \nOriginal contract amount: $35,000.00 (PO494832)\nTerm: March 1, 2025 through February 28, 2026 \n(current balance of contract PO: $4,657.50)\nModification No. 1 amount: $10,000.00 (This Ordinance)\nTotal contract amount: $45,000.00\n \nJwayyed Sharhabeel Jwayyed\nFID: 92-2687564 | CC-005040 | Expires: 11/19/2027\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify an existing contract with Jwayyed Jwayyed; to authorize the expenditure of $10,000.00 from the General Fund. ($10,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, on March 1, 2025, the City Attorney entered into a contract with Jwayyed Jwayyed in an amount not to exceed $35,000.00 to provide special prosecution services for our Prosecution team; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney encounters apparent conflict-of-interest situations in carrying out its official prosecutorial functions, requiring certain matters to be assigned to outside special counsel; and\nWHEREAS, the City Attorney has determined that the continued services of special counsel are necessary and in the best interest of the City to ensure uninterrupted and conflict-free prosecution; and\n \nWHEREAS, additional funds are required to handle the matters currently assigned, and such needs could not have been fully foreseen at the time of the initial contract award; and \n \nWHEREAS, continuing with the current contractor is the most efficient and cost-effective method for completing these matters, as the contractor possesses necessary experience, maintains familiarity with the ongoing cases, and is providing services at the same rates originally approved; \n \nWHEREAS,  it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of the City Attorney to authorize the Director to execute those documents necessary for the City to add additional funds to ensure continued special prosecutors necessary for prosecution. NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Attorney be and is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with Jwayyed Jwayyed, Attorney at Law, by increasing the contract amount by $10,000.00, for a total contract amount of $45,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purposes stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $10,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), 24-2401 (City Attorney), in object class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3. That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Codes Chapter 329 relating to contract modifications.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish such accounting codes as necessary and to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements, contracts, or modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
