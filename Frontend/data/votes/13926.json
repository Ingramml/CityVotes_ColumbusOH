BACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing engineering agreement with Strand Associates, Inc. for the Community Park/Maple Canyon Home Sewage Treatment System (HSTS) Elimination Project, CIP#650895-100004 in an amount of up to $14,991.76 for the Division of Water Reclamation. \n \nOrdinance 1697-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Strand Associates, Inc. for the Community Park/Maple Canyon Home Sewage Treatment System (HSTS) Elimination Project, CIP #650895-100004.  The contract is to design sanitary sewers along portions of Maple Canyon Avenue between Deewod Drive and Parkview Drive, and on Community Park Drive in the area of Maple Canyon Avenue and Hildreth Avenue.  The new sanitary sewer extension will serve this developed area of the City of Columbus that is currently served by home sewage treatment systems.  The sewer will be designed with adequate depth and capacity to allow for future extension to serve nearby properties in unincorporated Franklin County.\n \nWork performed to date consists of completing the topographic and right-of-way survey within the project limits, developing a draft preliminary design report, exploring additional alternatives requested by the Sewer System Engineering Section, detailed design, specifications, and contract documents.\n \nContract modification 1, authorized by Ordinance 2679-2020, added funding to complete detailed design.  This contract modification will add funding to make necessary manhole and sanitary sewer pipe slope adjustments to account for the possible growth of the area in the future while providing basement-level sanitary service in the area.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Columbus Community Area: 35 - Northland\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $14,991.76\nOriginal Contract Amount               $177,236.41 (PO188560, ORD 1697-2019)\nModification 1                                  $18,923.00 (PO259160, ORD 2679-2020)\nModification 2 (current)                    $14,991.76\nTotal                                          $211,151.17\n \n1.2 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis contract was awarded through the City’s Request for Proposal process to completely design the project.  Another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3 How cost of modification was determined:\nStand Associates, Inc. submitted a scope and fee showing expected hours required to complete the work based upon the established contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses. The project team then negotiated the contract modification amount.\n \n1.4 Timeline\nThe contract will be in effect until the project is constructed and accepted by the City.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project was being undertaken to eliminate the home Sewage treatment systems due to the potential ground water pollution hazard.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nStrand Associates, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-007735 and expired 10/12/2025. The certification is expired and will need to be updated before contracting can be completed. \n \nStrand Associates, Inc., plans to perform the contract modification work without the use of subcontractors.  \n \nThe certification of Strand Associates, Inc., is not in good standing at this time due to the expiration of contract compliance.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT\nThe 2025 Capital Improvement Budget must be amended to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation is necessary within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and add funds to an existing contract with Strand Associates, Inc., for professional engineering services for the Community Park/Maple Canyon HSTS Elimination Project; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $14,991.76 from the Sanitary Bond Fund for the contract modification.
