    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend Ordinance 3098-2023 authorizing the execution of a service contract between the Department of Public Utilities and Ethosoft, Inc. for the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) software for Division of Water (DOW) and Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD).\n \nOrdinance 3098-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on 12/4/2023, authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter a service contract with Ethosoft, Inc. and to expend up to $831,809.00.  The financing of this initial contract was to be done with a loan from the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Fresh Water Program.  When it was discovered OWDA would not fund the initial licensing and software costs of the project, Ordinance 3024-2024 was submitted to provide funding for this cost but conflicted with Ordinance 3098-2023.  This amendment to 3098-2023 is being processed to correct Ordinance 3098-2023 so the Auditor’s Certificate issued for Ordinance 3024-2024 can be used to pay for the initial licensing and software costs.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no increase in cost.  The $110,000.00 in costs not covered by the OWDA loan in Ordinance 3098-2023 is covered by the $110,000.00 authorized by Ordinance 3024-2024.\n \nThere is no penalty to the City for the extra $110,000.00 on the loan application.  The loan amount will be adjusted to the actual expense amount when the project is completed per the standard loan process with OWDA, and loan repayment will be per this revised amount.  The $110,000.00 on the ACPO issued via Ordinance 3024-2024 has already been encumbered and is available for use.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance 3098-2023 to remove $110,000.00 that is not covered by the loan obtained for this expenditure; and to clarify that this $110,000.00 expenditure is covered by Ordinance 3024-2024. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3098-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to execute a contract with Ethosoft, Inc. for the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) software for Division of Water (DOW) and Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD); and\nWHEREAS, after passage of 3098-2023 it was determined that the loan from the Ohio Water Development Authority would not pay for licensing and software costs; and \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3024-2024 authorized the expenditure of $110,000.00 to pay for the licensing and software costs; and\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities to remove the $110,000.00 from Ordinance 3098-2023 that was not covered by the Ohio Water Development Authority loan and to clarify the expenditure is covered by Ordinance 3024-2024; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That Ordinance 3098-2023 be hereby repealed and replaced as amended in the following, with additions in bold and deletions in strikethrough:\n(6.
