($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend four (4) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to obtain Water Meters, Yokes, Meter Setters and Appurtenances with Badger Meter, Inc. CC#007720, expires 12/28/2025, Core & Main LP, CC# 000148, expires 1/24/2027, Master Meter, Inc. CC# 010104, expires 1/2/2026 and Neptune Technology Group Inc., CC# 000689 (pending).  This contract provides for water meters, yokes, meter setters and appurtenances used for installation in the City’s water distribution system.  The Division of Water is the primary user. \n \nThe contracts, PO139440 with Badger Meter, Inc., PO139449 with Core & Main LP, PO139447 with Master Meter and PO139446 with Neptune Technology Group Inc. were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ009475 and will expire March 31, 2026.  It is in the best interest of the City to extend the contracts through March 31, 2027, to continue the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) project deployment program with these vendors to prevent risks to the project timeline and budget, and to avoid unnecessary risks of delays in product availability by changing meter vendors.  Introducing a new meter type would require building new meter specifications for the Meter Data Management System (MDM), increasing the risk of data and billing errors at the current installation rate.   The pricing for the products on these contracts remains the same.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contracts.  The Department of Public Utilities must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend four (4) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Water Meters, Yokes, Meter Setters and Appurtenances with Badger Meter, Inc., Core & Main LP; Master Meter, Inc.; and Neptune Technology Group Inc. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into four (4) Universal Term Contracts for Water Meters, Yokes, Meter Setters and Appurtenances for use by the Division of Water; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend the existing contracts with Badger Meter, Inc., Core & Main LP, Master Meter, Inc. and Neptune Technology Group Inc. to ensure that water meters and related items are readily available to install in the City’s water distribution system; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend Universal Term Contracts with Badger Meter, Inc., Core & Main LP, Master Meter, Inc. and Neptune Technology Group Inc. for the option to obtain Water Meters, Yokes, Meter Setters and Appurtenances, to continue the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) project deployment program with these vendors to prevent risks to the project timeline and budget, and to avoid unnecessary risks of delays in product availability by changing meter vendors, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts for the option to obtain Water Meters, Yokes, Meter Setters and Appurtenances with Badger Meter, Inc. PO139440, Core & Main LP PO139449, Master Meter PO139447 and Neptune Technology Group Inc. PO139446, for a period of one (1) year to and including March 31, 2027.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
