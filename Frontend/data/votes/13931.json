    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract renewal with Resource International, Inc. to continue providing Work and Asset Management (WAM) database and system administrative support.\nSince 2005, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities (DPU), aka Columbus Water & Power (CWP) has been utilizing a Work and Asset Management system (WAM) provided by Synergen/SPL/Oracle to manage and track maintenance, work, assets and materials. All of CWP’s divisions utilize the system, but the Department of Technology (DOT) is responsible for oversight and administration of the system, including centralized Information Technology (IT) functions, hardware and software support, email, security, and system integrations citywide. A project has been initiated to replace our existing Oracle WAM system. It will likely be several years before a new system is implemented so continued use and support is still necessary for our existing system.\nThe purpose of this contract is to provide WAM database and system administration support for DPU on an “as-needed” basis. These services will include but are not limited to maintenance and upkeep of both hardware and software as suggested by Department of Public Utilities in collaboration with the Department of Technology and Oracle.\nProcurement:  \nThe project was formally advertised (RFQ020377) on the Vendor Services website and Bonfire from November 15, 2021 to December 17, 2021. The city received one (1) response. The proposal was deemed responsive and was fully evaluated by the Evaluation Committee on December 21, 2021.\nThe original term of the contract was for a period of one year from the date of execution by the City of Columbus, with yearly renewal options for an additional four (4) years (for a maximum contract length of five (5) years), on a year by year basis, authorized by Ordinance 0743-2022. Any renewals will be contingent on funding availability, mutual agreement between the City and vendor, approval by ordinance of Columbus City Council, and appropriation and certification of funds by the City Auditor. The contract does not automatically renew. \nOrdinance 1474-2023 authorized the first renewal option, without funding, extending the contract through May 31, 2024.\nOrdinance 2937-2023 authorized additional funding allocations and extended the contract through December 31, 2024, allowing future renewals or modifications to be on a calendar-year cycle.\nOrdinance 2863-2024 authorized the second one-year renewal option, without funding, extending the contract through December 31, 2025. \nThis Ordinance authorizes the third one-year renewal option to extend the contract up to and including December 31, 2026, provide additional funding, and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n1.                     Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal #3 is $100,000.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $650,000.00.\n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known and provided for at the time of the initial contract award. This is a planned renewal.\n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used: This renewal is part of the terms of the contract as originally bid.\n4.                        How was cost determined: The cost for this renewal was provided by a written quotation and is in accordance with the original terms of the contract.\nPrincipal Parties: \nResource International, Inc.\n6350 presidential Gateway \nColumbus, Ohio 43231\nFarah B.
