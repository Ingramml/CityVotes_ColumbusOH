    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the following Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements listed below for the Division of Water’s Distribution Maintenance Section, and authorizes a fund transfer within the Water Operating Fund.\n \nThe parts and materials from these contracts are used by the Division of Water's Distribution Maintenance Section for maintenance of the water distribution systems and other related infrastructure.\n \nThe Purchase Agreement associations listed require approval by City Council in order for the division to expend more than $100,000.00, per Columbus City Code Section 329.\n \nUNIVERSAL TERM CONTRACT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS:\nPlumbing Supplies\nAsphalt Concrete\nReady Mix Concrete\nPrecast Concrete\nTopsoil\nMiscellaneous Industrial Hardware\nMainline Mechanical Joint Fittings\nMainline Couplings, Clamps and Various Parts\nMainline Valves & Boxes\nMainline Hydrant & Repair Parts\nWater Meters\nSewer & Water Pipe\nPaint & Paint Supplies\nSmall Tools\n \nVENDORS:   \n \nSee attached\n \nThe companies are not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search. \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$925,000.00 is needed for this ordinance. This is an unbudgeted expense that will be supported by transfers from the debt principal object class. There is sufficient budget authority available in the 2025 Water Operating Fund's Budget to fund the transfer. The remainder of the object class 04 appropriation ($325,723.07) will combine with existing object class 02 money (previously supported by debt principal transfers) to fund the expenditures.\n \nWater main and service line breaks are more common in the wintertime (70% of 2024 breaks) so most of this is intended to stock up inventory levels ahead of winter. The funds will also support additional expenses for copper line and meterbox replacements, which are part of a relatively new program that is ramping up.\n \n$2,707,993.43 has been spent year-to-date in 2025 (through 10.29.2025)\n$3,002,436.24 was spent in 2024 \n$2,405,573.01 was spent in 2023 \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements for the purchase of materials and supplies for the Division of Water; to authorize the transfer of $325,723.07 between object classes in the water operating fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $925,000.00 from the Water Operating Fund. ($925,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office has established Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements for the purchase of materials and supplies; and\n \nWHEREAS, the parts, materials and services purchased from the contracts will be used to replenish materials used for daily operating; and\n \nWHEREAS, these funds are unbudgeted, but as water main and service line breaks are more common in the wintertime, most of this is intended to stock up inventory levels ahead of winter; and \n \nWHEREAS, the funds will also support additional expenses for copper line and meterbox replacements, which are part of a relatively new program that is ramping up; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Water has a need to transfer $325,723.07  between object classes within the 2025 water operating fund and funds for the transfer have been identified and are available in object class 04; and \n \nWHEREAS, the expenditure of $925,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from object class 02, Materials and Supplies, in the Water Operating Fund, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance; and                     \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Water and the Department of Public Utilities to authorize the Finance and Management Director to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements for the purchase of parts, materials and services for the Division of Water; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements with the vendors on the attached spreadsheet for the purchase of supplies and materials for the Division of Water. \n \nSECTION 2.  That the transfer of $325,723.07 or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized between Object Classes within Fund 6000 Water Operating Fund per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $925,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from object class 02, Material and Supplies, in the Water Operating Fund, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
