    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Strawser Paving Company Inc. for the removal and replacement of 26,500 sqaure feet of heavy duty concrete pavement at the Compost Facility located at 7000 Jackson Pike (S.R. 104) Lockbourne, OH 43137 for the Division of Water Reclamation. The pavement is in a heavily trafficked area of the facility and is damaged throughout. The new pavement is designed so that it will withhold the loads it will experience on the day-to-day basis to keep the facility operating as safely and effectively as possible. \nThe Compost Facility plays a major role in the waste reuse of the City. To keep the trucks coming in with biosolids from the water reclamation plants operating smoothly, the ground they drive upon must be stable and prepared to withstand the load. Currently, it is severely damaged and not properly designed for the daily loads it experiences. Replacing the pavement will aid in keeping operations running as designed at the Compost Facility. \nThe contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $451,942.22. \nProcurement:\nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to professional service contracts.
