    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Water Operating Fund for additional personnel funds. Additional funds as a transfer are requested to support personnel costs through year-end. \n \nEmergency Justification: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow these financial transactions to be posted in the city's accounting system immediately to meet payroll costs for the December pay periods and to allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2025. Personnel funds are tracking close to available budget so this transfer will provide cushion should service credit pay or any retirement payouts cause personnel expense to exceed available budget.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $740,000.00 may be needed in the Water Operating Fund to meet the financial obligations of personnel costs. $740,000.00 will be transferred between object classes within the Water Operating Fund to support this potential need. There is sufficient budget authority in the 2025 Water Operating Fund's budget to fund the transfer. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer of $740,000.00 between object classes in the Water Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
