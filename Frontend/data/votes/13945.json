    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground\nThis ordinance modifies the service agreements with Columbus Next Generation Corporation originally authorized by Ordinance 1268-2021 and subsequently modified by Ordinances 3315-2021, 2279-2022, 2156-2023, 3382-2023, and 2565-2024, and with Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio authorized by Ordinance 2565-2024, for administration of the Owner-Occupied Initiative (OOI) program, which provides home repairs to address code violations.\n \nThe City of Columbus Office of the City Attorney and the Franklin County Environmental Courts have collaborated to assist homeowners throughout the city, particularly those who are elderly and/or disabled, in repairing code violations on their homes. Repair work has included roof repair and replacement, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch and foundation repair, removal of dead trees, and remediation of overgrown vegetation. \n \nThese homeowners often lack the financial means or physical ability to make the necessary repairs. In July 2021, the City Attorney’s Office obtained a $100,000 grant to launch the Home Repair Program. The program primarily has been administered by Columbus Next Generation Corporation, which works with local contractors as much as possible. Beginning in 2025, Habitat for Humanity joined Columbus Next Generation Corporation as a primary partner in this program. All contractors are licensed, bonded, insured through the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation, and registered with the City of Columbus to pull any required permits. Upon completion of repairs, the City Code Officer who referred the property to the court system verifies that the work meets requirements to close out the associated code violations.\n \nThis ordinance does not add any additional funds; it authorizes extensions of the original agreements with Columbus NextGen and Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio through December 31, 2026.  The need for additional time to complete the scope of work as stipulated in the contract agreements could not be foreseen at the start of the program as it was difficult to project the continuing and growing need in the community for these services. It has been determined that it is in the best interest to continue working with Columbus Next Gen and Habitat for Humanity to avoid any disruption in the owner-occupied exterior home repair program, especially for those homeowners who are currently engaged in the program to remediate open code violations.\n \nColumbus Next Generation CorporationFID: 46-2621229 | CC#: CC008637 | Expires: 5/2/2027\n \nHabitat for Humanity - MidOhioFID: 31-1217994 | CC#: CC004859 | Expires: 1/27/2027\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funds are requested with this legislation. This modification extends the term only.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify existing contracts with Columbus Next Generation Corporation and Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio to assist homeowners throughout the city who are elderly and/or disabled with home repairs necessary to correct code violations. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus Next Generation and Habitat for Humanity have been working with the City of Columbus Office of the City Attorney and the Franklin County Environmental Courts to assist elderly and/or disabled homeowners in repairing code violations on their homes; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Next Generation and Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio are trusted community partners who bring people together to inspire hope, build homes, empower families, and develop communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, repair activities include roof repair and replacement, gutter installation, painting, sewer line work, porch and foundation repair, and the removal of dead trees, overgrown vegetation, and other conditions contributing to code violations; and\n \nWHEREAS, many of these homeowners lack the financial means or physical ability to complete such repairs; \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the of the City Attorney's Office to authorize contract modifications with Columbus Next Generation Corporation and Habitat for Humanity - MidOhio to continue the exterior home repair program; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
