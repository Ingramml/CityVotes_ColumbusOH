($9,500.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC in an amount up to $9,500.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Program.  \n \nOriginal contract amount                     $     35,000.00                    Ord. N/A                      PO519727\nMOD No. 1 amount                             $       9,500.00                     \nTotal contract amount                          $     44,500.00                     \n \nThe agreement with Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC is to fulfill required temporary relocation services from extended stay style hotels for homeowners and/or tenants participating in the Lead Safe Columbus Program.  While the lead abatement methods are taking place, the homeowners and/or tenants should not occupy the home without safe controlled entry.  Under the Lead Safe Columbus Program, homeowners and/or tenants are provided lodging for up to 10 days maximum as set forth by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In the case that abatement exceeds 10 days, funding to allow homeowners and/or tenants a safe place to reside must be provided by an alternate source.  This modification will provide funding for these situations.\n \nIn accordance with C.C. 329.09(a): \n1.                     The amount of additional funds being requested under this modification is $9,500.00.\n2.                     The need for additional services was unforeseen at the time the initial contract was awarded, and a legislative modification is required by operation of C.C. 329.09(b).\n3.                     It is in the City’s best interest to modify Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC’s contract as they are currently providing these services for the Lead Safe Columbus Program.  The Department of Development advertised RFQ029560 on Vendor Services and proposals seeking contracts to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Program on February 7, 2025 with bids being due on March 3, 2025 and Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC was one of the two providers selected. \n4.                     The price for the additional services in this modification is determined by the original contract.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the Housing Division’s 2025 General Fund budget, but will require a transfer between object classes. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033213 and expires 05/20/2027.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Program that exceed 10 days; and to authorize the transfer and expenditure of $9,500.00 from the General Fund. ($9,500.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program was established to assist low- and moderate-income homeowners with lead abatement services that would impact a household remaining safely in their home; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ029560 on Vendor Services in March 2025 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Program and Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC was one of the two providers selected; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC in an amount up to $9,500.00 to provide hotel lodging that exceeds 10 days; and  \n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the transfer and expenditure of up to $9,500.00 from the 2025 General Fund Budget; and\n \nWHEREAS,  it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development, this modification should be authorized to continue program services; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development be and is hereby authorized to modify a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions LLC in an amount up to $9,500.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Program.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the purpose as stated in Section 1, the transfer of $9,500.00 within Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-10 (Housing Division), object class 05 (Other) to object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the purpose as stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $9,500.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept Div 44-10 (Housing Division), object class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this Ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to establish such accounting codes as necessary, to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements, contracts, or modifications associated with this Ordinance. \n \nSECTION 6.  That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Code Charter 329 relating to contract modifications. \n \nSECTION 7.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
