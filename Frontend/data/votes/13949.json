    "title": "To adopt a new Combined Development Related Fee Schedule for the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Public Service, and Public Safety. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nThe Development Services Special Revenue Fund was created to support the activities of the Department of Building and Zoning Services and other agencies charged with the review of private development, construction review, and inspection processes. This fund is supported solely by fees collected from the users of these services associated directly with the private development, construction review, and inspection processes. The current fee structure has been fully reviewed and compared to the actual cost incurred by the Department of Building and Zoning Services and other reviewing agencies and partners. Following this year's review, fees have modestly increased across all categories. These proposed fee schedule changes have been reviewed by the Building Services Review Council (BSRC).\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Fees have been revised to reflect the City's expenses associated with the private development processes.\n \nTitle\nTo adopt a new Combined Development Related Fee Schedule for the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Public Service, and Public Safety.
