The Owner Representative will assist in the procurement of an Architectural/Engineering firm as well as a construction contractor. The Owner Representative will help coordinate programming and design between the architectural team and the agencies that will be housed in the new municipal court building, including the Municipal Court Judges, City Attorney, Municipal Court Clerk, and facilitate the needs for technology, security and other applicable facility needs.  Additionally, in conjunction with the architectural team, the owner's representative will also be involved in construction oversight to confirm that all aspects of construction follow the contract documents and standard construction practices throughout the duration of the project. \n \nThe Department of Finance and Management, Office of Construction Management, solicited Request for Proposals for the professional owner representation services for the design and construction of a new Municipal Court building. The project was formally advertised on Vendor Services website. On May 19, 2021 the city received four (4) responses (0 AS1, 0 FBE, 0 MBE,) as listed.
