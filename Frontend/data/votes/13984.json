Adobe is best known for its Photoshop image editing software, Acrobat Reader and Acrobat, the Portable Document Format (PDF), and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud. Adobe software is used by City departments to improve efficiency and enhance communications while meeting requirements such as HIPPA compliance.\nThe City of Columbus has been utilizing the State Master Cloud Service Agreement for several years. This contract was chosen based on Adobe's representation that it provides cost advantages over a standalone Universal Term Contract.

This amount includes $62,286.00 in contingency funds for use when additional licenses are required.\nAdditionally, competitive bidding is being waived for this purchase.  City agencies are required to obtain at least three actual quotes from State Term Schedules (STS).
