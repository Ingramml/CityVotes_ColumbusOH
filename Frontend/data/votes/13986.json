The TIRC recommended that the AGREEMENT be continued, and send ENTERPRISE a letter, via certified mail, to specify if six (6) net new full-time permanent positions are not created, the AGREEMENT will be terminated in 2025 due to project non-compliance, and if there is no response within sixty (60) days of receipt of the letter, the AGREEMENT will be dissolved.\n \nA certified letter was sent to the ENTERPRISE on October 23, 2024 as recommended by the TIRC board as well as an electronic mail communication. The ENTERPRISE responded to the communication and outlined a plan to meet the requirements of the TIRC.  \n \nIn a review of the annual reporting filings, from the ENTERPRISE, for report year 2024 reviewed on August 22, 2025, the ENTERPRISE had not created the six (6) net new full-time permanent positions committed to in the AGREEMENT, therefore, the tax abatement is to be dissolved.   \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to dissolve the AGREEMENT between the CITY and the ENTERPRISE and to notify, as necessary, the local and state agencies of the dissolution.  \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo dissolve the Enterprise Zone Agreement with Advanced Turf Solutions, Inc. and ATS Columbus Investments II, LLC (collectively, referred to as “ENTERPRISE”), and to direct the Director of the Department of Development to notify, as necessary, the local and state tax authorities of the dissolution.
