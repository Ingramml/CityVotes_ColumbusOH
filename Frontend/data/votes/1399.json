    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the City Auditor to enter into an agreement for professional auditing services with Plante & Moran, PLLC for the calendar year 2021, for the City of Columbus and the Office of the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk, and to authorize the expenditure of up to $424,592.\n \nAll political subdivisons of Ohio are required to be audited by the Auditor of the State of Ohio or his designee (AOS).  The United States Office of Management and Budget through the Single Audit Act of 1996, as amended, has made it possible for all federal grants to be audited via one comprehensive audit. The AOS and the City of Columbus Auditor have concurred that the most appropriate way to meet all such requirements is to engage an independent public accounting firm (IPA) to conduct an independent audit of the City's accounting records and those of the Office of the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk including federal and state grants.  \n \nThe AOS office oversees a competitive process for selecting IPAs to perform government audits on behalf of the office.  In August 2012, the City of Columbus completed the AOS competitive bidding process for the audit contract covering each of the five years from 2012 through 2016, with each year being subject to the authorizing appropriation of Council.  Plante & Moran, PLLC was selected through this competitive bidding process. The 2012-2016 contract with IPA Plante & Moran, PLLC was extended for one year for the 2017 audit. For the 2018-2021 audit years, the AOS has made a recommendation that the City pursue an additional four year extension with IPA Plante & Moran, PLLC at a negotiated fee.\n \nAs the audit contract fees increased each year from 2012 through 2017 by 2.5% per year, Plante & Moran, PLLC has agreed to the terms of the contract with a 2.0% per year increase for the 2018-2021 audits.  The fee for 2021, with a 2.0% increase over the 2020 contracted fee, is $424,592.\n \nIt should be noted that 15% of this contract will be subcontracted to a minority firm of certified public accountants.  This has been a subcontracting requirement in the City's audit contract since 1985.\n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delays in finalizing the contracts and ensure work may begin on schedule to allow the Auditor’s Office to meet their requirements for a timely audit.\n \n \nPlante & Moran Contract Compliance Number is 38-1357951. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\n \nFunds are currently budgeted in the City Auditor's department for this expenditure.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to enter into an agreement along with the Auditor of the State of Ohio, and Plante & Moran, for professional auditing services for calendar year 2021; to waive competitive bidding; to authorize the expenditure of up to $424,592.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
