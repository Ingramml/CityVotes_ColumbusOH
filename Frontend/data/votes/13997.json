    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this legislation is to provide financial support to three community resettlement agencies for outreach and support regarding food and housing insecurity. Funds are intended for programming that will occur during the 2026 calendar year. Community Refugee and Immigration Services, Inc. (CRIS), Jewish Family Service, and Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services will use this assistance to address food and housing insecurity in light of recent cuts to SNAP for CRIS clients in need of assistance. While some refugees received SNAP funds in November, most will likely see the cuts in December and beyond. Each organization will receive $67,000 to provide services for housing and insecurity due to the recent changes impacting the SNAP program and the refugee populations each organization serves.\n \nThe mission of CRIS is to help refugees and immigrants reach safety and stability, sustain self-sufficiency, and achieve successful integration into the Central Ohio community.\n \nJewish Family Service's mission is to helps individuals and families achieve economic self-sufficiency and emotional stability.\n \nThe mission of Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services is to be the focal point of societal integration for immigrants, refugees, and low-income individuals to help improve the quality of life through education, training, supportive services, and self-development opportunities while increasing awareness of the diverse cultures and heritage.\n \nGrant funding for the programming may include the purchase of food and/or non-alcoholic beverage items, which serve the public for the purpose of administering programming. Food and/or non-alcoholic beverage purchases will be subject to what is allowable in the grant agreement. Any cost of food and/or non-alcoholic beverage incurred before the effective date of the ordinance will not be reimbursed. Costs will not exceed $15 per person and any purchase of alcohol is strictly prohibited.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018.\n \nREASON FOR EMERGENCY: It is immediately necessary to authorize grant agreements with these nonprofit agencies in support of their immigrant and refugee resettlement services and programs, in light of the reduced funding being received from other sources.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter grant agreements with Community Refugee and Immigration Services, Inc., Jewish Family Service, and Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the payment of non-food related program expenses; to allow food and/or non-alcoholic beverage expenses incurred after the effective date of the ordinance; and to declare an emergency. ($201,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, according to the National Immigration Law Center, \"This summer, Congress passed the harmful 2025 reconciliation law that drastically cut food assistance for immigrants who were otherwise eligible under the law. The bill restricted eligibility for SNAP, which will now be available only to lawful permanent residents (LPRs or green card holders), certain immigrants from Cuba and Haiti, and people living in the United States under a Compact of Free Association (known as “COFA citizens”);\" and\n \nWHEREAS, the National Immigration Law Center goes on to say, \"SNAP benefits are an important and effective policy. Substantial data shows that SNAP leads to lower health care costs and improved health outcomes. The program significantly reduces poverty, with some estimates that SNAP can reduce the poverty rate by 14 to 16 percent. Each dollar in SNAP generates $1.79 in economic activity;\" and \n \nWHEREAS, the mission of Community Refugee and Immigration Services, Inc. is to help refugees and immigrants reach safety and stability, sustain self-sufficiency, and achieve successful integration into the Central Ohio community; and\n \nWHEREAS, the mission of Jewish Family Service is to help individuals and families achieve economic self-sufficiency and emotional stability; and\n \nWHEREAS, the mission of Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services is to be the focal point of societal integration for immigrants, refugees, and low-income individuals to help improve the quality of life through education, training, supportive services, and self-development opportunities while increasing awareness of the diverse cultures and heritage; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is the steadfast policy of this Council to protect and celebrate all members of our community, including immigrants and refugees; and\n \nWHEREAS, this Council stands in firm opposition to all xenophobic, prejudiced, and hateful rhetoric from other levels of government; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in that it is immediately necessary to authorize grant agreements with these nonprofit agencies in support of their immigrant and refugee resettlement services and programs in light of reduced funding being received from other sources, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorizes to enter into grant agreements with Community Refugee and Immigration Services, Inc.
