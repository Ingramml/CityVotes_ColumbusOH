    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  \n \nFunding for the life insurance program is necessary to ensure continuation of the program in accordance with the negotiated labor contracts.  The Human Resources Department requests to contract, through an extension, with The Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company and to provide funding from February 1, 2026 through December 31, 2026 for this program. The contract originated February 1, 2021 and the contract term was for 3 years, with two (2) one (1) year renewals.\n  \nThe effective date for the contract extension is February 1, 2026.\n \nIn 2025, the Department of Human Resources began to research procuring a system to assist with leave administration for the City. During this process, and in collaboration with our consultant, Marsh & McLellan Agency, it was discovered that leave administration and short-term disability products could potentially be bid together. Hartford currently holds the contract for short-term disability and life insurance. The leave administration system would need to be integrated with Dayforce and possibly short-term disability. Dayforce, the Auditor’s Office, Department of Technology and the Department of Human Resources availability will need to be reviewed, and a project plan developed. Due to timing of this initiative, the Hartford contract will need to be extended through December 31, 2026.\n \nThe cost estimate for 2026 is based on 2025 benefits fund expenditures and expected changes due to union negotiations.\n \nEmergency action is requested to ensure the life insurance program for city employees is able to commence as soon as contractually possible, thereby maintaining continuity of service.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the 2026 Employee Benefits Fund for this contract.  This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2026 insurance appropriation ordinance 3195-2025.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Human Resources Department to contract with The Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company to provide all eligible employees life insurance coverage from February 1, 2026 through December 31, 2026, and to authorize the expenditure of $2,300,000.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the costs of said contract; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency. ($2,300,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to contract with The Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company to provide all eligible employees basic life insurance administration from February 1, 2026 through December 31, 2026; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,300,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay contract costs for life insurance services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to contract with The Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company to ensure the life insurance program for city employees is able to commence as soon as contractually possible and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                      That the Director of the Human Resources Department is hereby authorized to enter into contract with The Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company to provide basic life insurance to all eligible employees from February 1, 2026 through December 31, 2026.\n \nSECTION 2.                       That the expenditure of $2,300,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary for coverage is hereby authorized to be expended as follows:  \n \nDepartment: 4602 | Fund: 5502 | Subfund: 550203 | Program: RM005 (Life)\n \nSECTION 3.                     That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That City Council finds it to be in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes and does hereby waive the same.\n \nSECTION 5.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage, if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
