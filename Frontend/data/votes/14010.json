That the City Council, based on evidence provided by the Columbus Division of Police and the Columbus City Attorney’s office, hereby finds that the permit holder at such premises has operated the liquor permit business in a manner that demonstrates a disregard for the law, regulations or local ordinances of this state and city, which is a basis to refuse the renewal of a liquor permit under RC section 4303.292(A)(1)(b); and further, the Council finds that the permit premises is so located with respect to the neighborhood that substantial interference with public decency, sobriety, peace or good order would result from the renewal of the permit and operation thereunder by the applicant, which also is a basis to refuse a liquor permit renewal under RC section 4303.292(A)(2)(c); and based upon the above findings the City Council hereby objects to the renewal of this liquor permit.\nSection 3. That the City Clerk be and hereby is directed to forward a certified copy of this resolution to the director of the Ohio Department of Commerce, Division of Liquor Control, and with said resolution the City Attorney shall express his opinion regarding the basis for this resolution as required by section 4303.271(B) of the Ohio Revised Code.
