    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into construction contract modification for the Big Walnut Trunk Extension (Phase 2) project, CIP #650033-100002, with the Obayashi Corporation in an amount up to $14,000,000.00.\n \nThe Big Walnut Trunk Extension project is an extension of the Big Walnut Sanitary Trunk Sewer north of Central College Road and east of Hoover Reservoir.  This project will provide sanitary sewer service for the rapidly developing area between Hoover Reservoir and the Village of New Albany, north of State Route 161.\n \nThis contract modification is to pay for the work associated with the use of a road header machine to complete tunnel boring from the opposite direction.  The original tunnel boring machine became inaccessible due to excessive levels of methane encountered which halted drilling. In addition, excessive amounts of pyrite were encountered during the tunnel boring which was unanticipated and significantly slowed boring operations.  Shaft and tunnel mining operations have been completed even with the significant differing site conditions encountered. The remaining work includes: pipe installation and annular space grouting, shaft installation and backfill, and final restoration.  Funding must be added to complete these tasks due to the extra expense associated with the unexpected site conditions.\n \nContract work was required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 1,250 days of the date of Notice To Proceed (NTP) given by the City.  This contract modification will include an extension to the contract duration of up to 180 calendar days.\n \nPlanning area = “99-Citywide”\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $14,000,000.00\nOriginal Contract                                 $81,491,778.00 (PO371241 / ORD 3581-2022) \nCurrent Modification                            $14,000,000.00\nFuture Modifications                                          $0.00\n                     TOTAL                         $95,491,778.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis scope of work was bid using the City’s Invitation for Bid process and included in the awarded contract.  Another procurement process is not required to complete the work. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost was determined via force account records and contracted bid item amounts, then further negotiated with the contractor.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project is an extension of the Big Walnut Sanitary Trunk Sewer north of Central College Road and east of Hoover Reservoir. This project will provide sanitary sewer service for the rapidly developing area between Hoover Reservoir and the Village of New Albany, north of State Route 161. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nObayashi Corporation’s contract compliance number is CC033371 and expires 11/15/26.\n \nThe certification of Obayashi Corporation was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Obayashi Corporation. \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized loan application and acceptance of funding for the WPCLF program via Ordinance 2720-2024, passed by Council on 10/28/24.  This project was not specifically listed as one of the projects expected to be loan funded in Ordinance 2720-2024.  Section 2 of that Ordinance authorized the Director of Public Utilities to make changes to the list based upon departmental need.  However, OWDA still requires a separate ordinance showing City Council has approved the Department of Public Utilities applying for this specific loan.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA January Board meeting and this ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.   \n \nThe 2025 Capital Budget must be amended to match budget authority with the project.  Funds must be appropriated within the WPCLF Loan Fund, Fund 6111.  This is a reimbursement loan.  The Department of Public Utilities must pay Obayashi Corporation and then submit the paid invoices to OWDA for reimbursement.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract modification for the Big Walnut Sanitary Trunk Extension Phase 2 project with Obayashi Corporation; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to apply for a Water Pollution Control Loan Fund loan to finance this contract modification; to make this ordinance contingent upon that loan being approved; to amend the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $14,000,000.00 from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund.
