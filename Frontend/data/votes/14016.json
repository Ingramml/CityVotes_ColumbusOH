Doutt Upground Reservoir provides 9 billion gallons of off-stream storage to support the existing DRWP.  Projected water usage growth in the City, the construction of a second water plant that will pull from the Scioto River, and recent droughts necessitate additional, reliable water supply sources, which these upground reservoirs will provide.  Water quality provided by the City is essential to human health and economic growth and development.\nThe Upground Reservoirs R1 and R3 Engineering Services contract is for Professional Engineering Services (Design Professional or “DP” services) for the two needed reservoirs.  The contract includes a preliminary design phase for both reservoirs (designated R1 and R3), raw water lines associated to each reservoir, the existing pump station and intake structure, and other appurtenant structures necessary for the overall function of the reservoir system. The work shall also include conceptual design of any required improvements or modifications including potential alternatives to existing support facilities and equipment to fulfill the project intent.\n \nThe primary objective of the DP services is to develop a concise set of design documents that will allow for the complete construction of facilities that will serve all intentions of their planned operation and will provide security, resiliency, flexibility and ease of operation with reasonable maintenance requirements.\n \nThis project is located within the following Community Area:  Citywide (99).\n \nTIMELINE: The Notice to Proceed for this contract is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2026 with the completion of the Preliminary Design Report estimated in the fourth quarter of 2026.  It is anticipated contract modifications will be issued for Detailed Design for future capital construction projects related to the upground reservoirs.  If so, detailed design of the first facility will begin the fourth quarter of 2027 and is anticipated to be completed in 2029. Contract modifications are also anticipated to be issued for Engineering Services During Construction for upground reservoir projects.  If so, this contract will continue until construction of the facilities are completed and accepted by the City, which is currently anticipated to be 2035.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The amount of the initial contract and the anticipated future contract modifications is listed below.\n \nCost summary: \n                     Initial Contract                                                                    $4,442,883.00\n                     Future Modification #1 (future)                                          $12,000,000.00\n                     Future Modification #2 (future)                                          $13,250,000.00\n                     Future Modification #3 (future)                                            $4,500,000.00\n                     Future Modification #4 (future)                                            $5,250,000.00\n                     Future Modification #5 (future)                                          $11,250,000.00\n                     Future Modification #6 (future)                                          $13,000,000.00\n                     Future Modification #7 (future)                                               $500,000.00\n                             CONTRACT TOTAL                                          $64,192,883.00\n \n2.
