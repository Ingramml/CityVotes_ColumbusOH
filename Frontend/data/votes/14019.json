    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Claypool Electric, Inc.,, for the Southerly Water Reclamation Plant Variable Frequency Drives and Harmonic Filter Upgrades project, CIP #650346-100002, in an amount up to $12,549,825.00; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for Prevailing Wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $12,551,825.00. \n \nWater Reclamation has identified numerous Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) and Harmonic Filters at several Southerly Water Reclamation Plant (SWRP) processes that are nearing the end of their useful service life and are becoming increasingly difficult to repair and maintain. These processes include the fine screens, the Return Activated Sludge (RAS) pumps, the thickening centrifuges, and the skimmings concentrators. This construction contract will replace VFDs and harmonic filters, provide new controls that may be necessary to integrate the new equipment into the existing systems, and provide any other ancillary work to provide a fully functioning system. This work is part of the City’s continuing effort to upgrade its treatment facilities, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety.\n \nThe Columbus Community is 99-Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE: All work shall be substantially complete within 765 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed, with final completion to occur within 825 calendar days.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed on or about February 2026.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nThe bid amount and proposed award amount is $12,549,825.00, including a 15% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n                     \nOriginal Contract                                                   $12,549,825.00                                          \nFuture Anticipated Needs                                       $              0.00\nDPS Prevailing Wage Administration                      $        2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                           $12,551,825.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThe performance of this contract’s activities to provide construction services to replace VFDs and Harmonic Filters at Southerly Water Reclamation Plant is needed to continue the City’s effort to upgrade its treatment facilities, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the City’s water reclamation system and the budget.\n \n3.

PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nClaypool Electric, Incorporated and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA). City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2720-2024, passed by Council on 10/28/24.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA January Board meeting. This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA. The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved. The WPCLF program is now a reimbursement loan. The City will pay invoices for the work and then submit the paid invoices to OWDA for reimbursement.  There is budget authority for this project in the 2025 Capital Improvement.  Funds must be appropriated in the WPCLF Loan Fund, Fund 6111.\n \nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Claypool Electric,  Inc., for the Southerly Water Reclamation Plant VFD and Harmonic Filter Upgrades project; to authorize an amendment to the 2025 Capital Improvement Budget; to appropriate funds within the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund; to make this ordinance contingent upon the Ohio Water Development Authority approving a loan for this project; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $12,551,825.00 from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund and the Sanitary Bond Fund to pay for the project.
