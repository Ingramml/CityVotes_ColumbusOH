    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with The Salvation Army, in an amount up to $147,535.00, to provide direct outreach services to victims of human trafficking. \nHuman Trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of people through force, fraud, or deception with the aim of exploiting them for profit.  Men, women, and children of all ages and from all backgrounds can become victims of this crime, which occurs in every region of the world. The State of Ohio ranks 5th in cases of human trafficking by the National Human Trafficking Hotline, with Columbus representing the largest sex trafficking market in the state.\nTraditionally, communities have addressed the illicit sex industry by incorrectly and unfairly targeting sellers and victims of human trafficking with enforcement and incarceration. As City Council considers amending the Columbus City Code to focus enforcement and criminal liability on buyers, Council recommends attacking the complex issue of human trafficking through various approaches. First, there is a need for funding to support service organizations that provide shelter, counseling, and healthcare resources to victims of human trafficking. Oftentimes these services can be the difference between life and death for victims. Council is committed to setting aside funding from the Reimaging Safety fund to invest in victims' assistance organizations that serve communities with a high number of calls for service related to human trafficking and opioid overdoses. These organizations include The Salvation Army, She Has a Name, 1DivineLine2Health, Sanctuary Collective, and Out of Darkness.  Each grant agreement shall have its own ordinance.\n \n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure program services continue without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the General Fund’s Reimagine Safety Subfund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 000717 and expires on 6/3/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with The Salvation Army in an amount up to $147,535.00 to provide direct outreach services to victims of human trafficking; to authorize the appropriation of up to $147,535.00 within the General Fund Reimagine Safety Subfund; to authorize the transfer of funds between subfunds and departments within the General Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $147,535.00 within the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
