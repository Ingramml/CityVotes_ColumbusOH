    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nIn 2016 and 2017, the City of Columbus (the “City”) commissioned a study from HR&A Advisors on the effectiveness of the City’s economic development incentives, including real property tax abatements in Community Reinvestment Areas (“CRAs”). Based on the results of the study, the City revised its policies concerning CRA abatements, and decided to encourage the development of affordable housing by conditioning the provision of CRA abatements, in certain circumstances, on the inclusion of affordable housing. Since then, Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes and the City’s CRAs have undergone multiple revisions to address the changing needs of housing development within the City. This code change will adopt certain administrative modifications to Chapter 4565.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend sections of Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes to enhance administrative efficiency in the Residential Tax Incentive Program by recognizing Qualifying Development Projects and Qualifying Programs; to standardize description of the Residential Tax Incentive; and to standardize approval paths through the Housing Officer who is designated as the Director of the Department of Development.
