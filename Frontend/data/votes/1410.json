    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management 2020 Project, in an amount up to $6,826,100.00, for the Division of Water.\n \nThis contract is assisting the City with managing a capital improvement program consisting of multiple capital improvement projects to ensure completion in accordance with design requirements and City’s needs, while serving as a liaison between the construction contractor, design professional (DP), and City personnel.  Work performed to date includes program support services, design phase construction management services (e.g., construction cost estimating, constructability reviews, and construction scheduling), and construction administration / construction inspection (CA/CI) services.  Future phases of the contact will continue these same services. \n \nThis Renewal (number #1) provides funding to continue program support services, design phase construction management services, and construction phase CA/CI services.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” as the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $6,826,100.00\nOriginal Contract                     $2,442,500.00  (PO255315, PO255328, PO255330, PO255406, PO255408, PO255409, PO255410, PO255412, PO255413, PO255414, PO255415, PO255416, PO255417, PO255419, PO255420, PO255421, PO255422, PO255423)\nRenewal #1 (current)                                          $6,826,100.00\nContract Total (Orig. + Ren. 1)                                          $9,268,600.00\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant has already provided both design phase and construction phase services for the projects assigned to this contract.  Bidding this work out to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the work already performed and would interrupt construction phase services for projects currently under construction, which would increase costs to the City.  \n \nHow cost of renewal was determined:\nThe City identified the services that would be needed for each project over the renewal period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project and subsequently revised by consultant based on City’s comments.  \n \nECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis Professional Construction Management contract will support various projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects will maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the central Ohio area.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nMost projects will be located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public and for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for projects that occur outside of secure areas.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying DPU’s environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  20-0953973, expires 12/20/21, Majority, DAX No. 990.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hill International, Inc.\n \nFUTURE CONTRACT MODIFICATION(S):  Five future contract renewals are anticipated for design and engineering services during construction.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management 2020 Project; for the Division of Water; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $6,826,100.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.  ($6,826,100.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No’s PO255315, PO255328, PO255330, PO255406, PO255408, PO255409, PO255410, PO255412, PO255413, PO255414, PO255415, PO255416, PO255417, PO255419, PO255420, PO255421, PO255422, PO255423 were authorized by Ordinance No. 2380-2020, passed November 16, 2020, was executed on December 22, 2020, and approved by the City Attorney on December 22, 2020 and December 23, 2020, for the Professional Construction Management 2020 Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal No. 1 (current) is needed to provide funding to continue program support services, design phase construction management services, and construction phase CA/CI services; and\n \nWHEREAS, five future contract renewals are anticipated for design and engineering services during construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management 2020 Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a transfer and expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
