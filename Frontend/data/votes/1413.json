    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  During the redesign of the initial Digestion Process Expansion project, the APD upgrade and rehabilitation portion of the project was removed. This project will pick up the rehabilitation portion of the work. In addition, this project will evaluation efficiencies in the solids train operation that may provide cost savings and revenue streams to the City through tipping fees for fats, oils, grease and organics receiving and through the production of a phosphorous byproduct that can be sold a fertilizer. This project will also help the plant utilize the biogas generated in the digesters by cleaning impurities, such as siloxanes and hydrogen sulfide, from the gas. \nThe community planning area for this project is 99 - Citywide.\n \nFUTURE RENEWAL(S)/MODIFICATION(S):  Future renewals are anticipated for project. The initial term for this agreement will be for 18 months. Upon completion of Step 1 - Preliminary Design Services, a contract renewal will be provided for Step 2 - Detailed Design Services and a second renewal will be provided for Step 3 - Services During Construction. The estimated end for all phases of the contract is anticipated to be in October 2027.\n \nTIMELINE: The initial term for this agreement will be for 18 months. Upon completion of Step 1 - Preliminary Design Services, a contract renewal will be provided for Step 2 - Detailed Design Services and a second renewal will be provided for Step 3 - Services During Construction. The estimated end for all phases of the contract is anticipated to be in October 2027.\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project may involve the diversion of food waste from the landfill, to the Southerly Digesters. This will provide an economic and environmental benefit by reducing waste sent to the landfill and allowing Southerly to produce biogas for possible cogeneration or compressed natural gas generation. The addition of fats, oils, and grease (FOG) will allow the plant to produce more biogas. Removal of phosphorous from the Southerly solids stream will allow for better sludge dewatering, prevent the solids from nutrient limitation when land applying, and will produce a revenue stream through the selling of the phosphorous compound. In addition, the removal of phosphorous from the treatment system may help limit the amount of phosphorous discharged to the Scioto River.\nBID INFORMATION: The selection of the firm providing the professional engineering services has been performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Columbus City Code, Section 329, \"Awarding professional service contracts through requests for proposals.\"  \nProposals for this project were received on April 16, 2021 and three proposals were received. The three firms were Brown and Caldwell, Hatch Associates, and Hazen and Sawyer.\nAn evaluation committee reviewed the proposals and scored them based on the criteria within Columbus City Code Section 329.  The Department of Public Utilities recommends the agreement be awarded to Brown and Caldwell.\nThe Contract Compliance Number for Brown and Caldwell is 94-1446346 (expires 8/20/2021, MAJ, DAX #010815).\n Searches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Brown and Caldwell. \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance requires a transfer of up to $1,129,193.00 within and an expenditure of up to $2,504,192.85 from the Sanitary General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is also necessary to align the authority with the expenditure.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Brown and Caldwell for professional engineering services for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Digestion Process Expansion Project, Phase II for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage; to authorize a transfer of up to $1,129,193.00 within and an expenditure of up to $2,504,192.85 from the Sanitary General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.  ($2,504,192.85)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, three (3) technical proposals for professional engineering services for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Digestion Process Expansion Project, Phase II were received on April 9, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities recommends that the agreement be awarded to Brown and Caldwell; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a transfer within of $1,129,193.00 and an expenditure of $2,504,192.85 within the Sanitary General Obligation Bond Fund 6109; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to align authority to match the expenditure; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional engineering services agreement with Brown and Caldwell for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Digestion Process Expansion Project, Phase II, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to enter into a professional engineering services agreement for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Digestion Process Expansion Project, Phase II with Brown and Caldwell, 445 Hutchinson Ave., Suite 540, Columbus, OH 43235; in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement on file in the Office of the Division of Sewerage & Drainage.\n \nSECTION 2.
