    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Columbus Foundation in support of the RAPID 5 initiative.\n \nThe RAPID 5 visioning initiative will bring together governments, businesses, and residents to create a vision for an open space system that spans the region. This greenspace system will extend beyond individual jurisdictions and neighborhoods and expand green corridors around Franklin County’s five major waterways: Big Darby, Scioto, Olentangy, Alum Creek, and Big Walnut. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many park systems, including Metro Parks, have seen significant increases (upwards to 30% or more) in visits since March 2020, demonstrating how park and trail networks are a much-needed amenity and infrastructure to support mental and physical well-being, but also a vital transportation connection. The RAPID 5 Project will support and complement the implementation of the Regional Trail Vision to create a connected trail network.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiative subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide the resources necessary to initiate regional planning.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Columbus Foundation in support of the RAPID 5 initiative; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $50,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
