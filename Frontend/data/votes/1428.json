    "description": "Explanation\n1.  Background\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into multiple subrecipient agreements with organizations to provide rental and utility assistance and housing stability services to residents in the local area who qualify for the assistance as provided in the laws, regulations, and other guidance provided by the U. S. Department of Treasury Emergency Rental Assistance 1 (ERA 1) program, providing for expenses starting January 1, 2021.  The amount anticipated to be awarded to organizations is up to $10,711,312.20.\n \nOrganizations selected to receive these funds will be selected through an application process to be conducted by the Department of Development. The Notice of Financial Award (NOFA) will be issued via direct email to agencies and to partners to send to their networks of agencies, a City press release, and on the City’s website. The City will receive and review proposals in July 2021 and anticipate awarding funding to qualified vendors in August 2021.\n \nBecause of the timing of NOFA and the pending City Council break in August, the Director of Development is requesting City Council approval to enter into subrecipient agreements selected as part of this process immediately after all applications have been evaluated and organizations selected.  \n \nOrdinance 0284-2021 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate $26,822,803.20 of federal Emergency Rental Assistance 1 program funds, as passed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021. To date, approximately $16M of ERA1 funds have been allocated to three subrecipients and this ordinance seeks to allocate the remaining funds. The purpose of the current NOFA is to find and award funding to organizations who are able to provide outreach and intake services to hard-to-reach and vulnerable populations experiencing housing instability. \n \nSelected organizations will manage a program to provide rental and utility assistance, and housing stability services, to residents in the local area who qualify for the assistance as provided in the laws regulations and other current guidance provided by the U. S. Department of Treasury.  Rental assistance will be provided to qualifying residents of the local community for up to 12 months plus an additional three months, if necessary, to ensure housing stability. \n \nIn these programs, at least 60% of the funding will support households with an AMI at 50% or below and/or have a member of the household who has been unemployed for 90 days; up to 40% of the funding can be used for households with an AMI at 80% or below; and 10% of the funding will be utilized for Administrative costs.\n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will be modified while this subrecipient agreement is in effect and it is requested that the Director of Development be given the authority to modify the scope of services and/or terms and conditions of any subrecipient agreement without seeking additional Council Approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 passed by Congress and signed into law December 27, 2020, and is available in the department’s ERA budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into multiple subrecipient agreements with to-be-determined organizations to provide rental and utility assistance and housing stability services to residents in the local area who qualify for the assistance as provided in the laws, regulations, and other current guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury Emergency Rental Assistance 1 (ERA 1) program in an amount up to $10,711,312.20; to authorize payment of expenses starting January 1, 2021; to authorize the Director of Development to modify the scope of services and/or terms and conditions of the subrecipient agreements as needed without seeking further City Council approval; to authorize the expenditure of up to $10,711,312.20 from the Emergency Rental Assistance 1 (ERA 1) fund; and to declare an emergency.
