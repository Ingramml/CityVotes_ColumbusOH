    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Central Community House of Columbus Inc. (CCH) in an amount up to $700,000.00 for the administration of the TRANSIT ARTS Residency Program (TARP) and the construction of a simple performing arts pavilion. \n \nTARP, a new, pilot program created by CCH, will provide guidance and support to artists who will then work with youth in the Near East, Near Southside, and Franklinton neighborhoods to establish a series of art projects ranging from temporary to long term installations to performance arts based events. Young people will have an unparalleled opportunity to work with artists on projects that will encompass the broadest possible spectrum of the arts, including visual arts, music arts, literature arts, performance and theater arts, dance arts, and technology arts.  Funding will also support the construction of a pavilion in which the artists in residence and youth will use to showcase their work.  The program began June 1, 2021, and will continue through the end of 2021.\n \nTRANSIT ARTS (TA) is a citywide youth arts development program of CCH. Originating as the Short Stop Teen Center in the Short North, TA has a 30 year history of engaging teenagers and young adults in art and community building activity. CCH will administer the project funding. The long-term goal is to expand the program in 2021 to include project sites at St. Stephen’s Community House (Linden) and Godman Guild (Weinland Park/Downtown area).\n \nThese services provided by CCH cannot be provided by existing City employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 006068 and expires 4/22/22.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funding is available in the Fund 2237 (Neighborhood Economic Development fund).\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested to providing funding immediately in order to maintain the program schedule.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a not-for-profit service contract with Central Community House of Columbus Inc. in an amount up to $700,000.00 for the administration of the TRANSIT ARTS Residency Program and construction of a pavilion; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure up to $700,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development fund; to authorize the payment of expenses starting June 1, 2021; and to declare an emergency.
