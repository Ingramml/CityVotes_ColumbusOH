    "title": "To amend Chapter 2307 of Columbus City Codes with new provisions regarding human trafficking and sexual exploitation.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nHuman Trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. Men, women, and children of all ages and from all backgrounds can become victims of this crime, which occurs in every region of the world. The State of Ohio ranks 5th in cases of human trafficking by the National Human Trafficking Hotline, with Columbus representing the largest sex trafficking market in the state. \nThere is a need for funding to support service organizations that provide shelter, counseling, and healthcare resources to victims of human trafficking. Oftentimes these services can be the difference between life and death for victims. \nIn addition, buyers that purchase victims for sexual exploitation are engaging in behavior that harms victims and the communities in which they live. As the City of Columbus establishes Section 2307.231 and increases penalties for individuals who are found guilty of sexual exploitation, it is prudent and just to utilize the penalties for sexual exploitation offenses to supplement programs that support the victims of this offense. The creation of the Victims of Human Trafficking fund will allow the City of Columbus to harness these penalties in order to create a pool of funding for victims’ services. \nThis legislation will authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish a new Victims of Human Trafficking fund to support organizations dedicated to providing services to victims of human trafficking.\nIn order to determine whether this legislation is having the desired effect of reducing demand for sex work, a thorough review and assessment of this amendment will occur 2 years from the date which this legislation takes effect.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Chapter 2307 of Columbus City Codes with new provisions regarding human trafficking and sexual exploitation.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Council established of Section 2307.231 within the Columbus City Code, in order to create the offense “sexual exploitation” and establish penalties for violation of this section; and\nWHEREAS, In order to address the impact of human trafficking on victims and communities, funding is necessary to support organizations dedicated to providing shelter, counseling, and healthcare services to victims of human trafficking; and\nWHEREAS, The Victims of Human Trafficking fund will be established through the distribution of fines incurred for violation of Section 2307.231; and\nWHEREAS, It is necessary to establish this fund to ensure fines incurred for violation of Section 2307.231 can be distributed to organizations working to combat the impacts of human trafficking; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
