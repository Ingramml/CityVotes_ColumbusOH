    "description": "Explanation\n \nIn January 2020, the Columbus Community Safety Advisory Commission presented final recommendations for police reform focused on areas such as de-escalation, crisis intervention, and implicit bias training; use of force policies; diversity recruitment and retention; and early intervention and officer wellness programs. Their recommendations were informed by and consistent with an independent operational review of the Columbus Division of Police conducted by Matrix Consulting. \n \nAmong their recommendations, the Commission called for the establishment of an independent civilian review board, and an amendment to the City Charter to create a city-funded, operationally independent, professionally-staffed, public-facing entity empowered to participate fully in criminal or administrative investigations involving Division personnel. The Commission also recommended the City implement a process for independent investigation of 1) officer use of force, including but not limited to, officer use of force resulting in death, officer involved shootings, and in-custody injuries and deaths; and 2) complaints about serious Columbus Division of Police officer misconduct. \n \nIn July 2020, consistent with the recommendations of the Columbus Community Safety Advisory Commission, Mayor Ginther and City Council announced their intent to place an issue on the November ballot to amend the City Charter to establish a civilian police review board and a Department of the Inspector General for the Columbus Division of Police. On November 3, 2020, Columbus voters overwhelmingly approved the amendment by nearly 75 percent.\n \nAlso consistent with the Community Safety Advisory Commission Civilian Review Board recommendations, the City established the Civilian Review Board Work Group to develop the board’s roles and responsibilities. In December 2020, the work group provided their recommendations to the Mayor which form the basis for this ordinance.\n \nIn April 2021, Mayor Ginther appointed, with Columbus City Council’s concurrence, the inaugural members of the Columbus Civilian Police Review Board. This ordinance supplements the Charter provisions by conferring upon the newly appointed board expanded authority to develop administrative rules; receive, initiate, review, and cause the investigation of complaints of misconduct; make recommendations on resolutions of complaints; make recommendations on discipline; and in specific circumstances, to subpoena witnesses and evidence.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in that it is necessary to pass this ordinance in order to allow for the timely establishment and structure of the Civilian Police Review Board and the initiation of the establishment of the Office of the Inspector General, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo enact Chapter 235 to codify the composition of the Civilian Police Review Board and Department of the Inspector General for the Division of Police; to supplement the City Charter by conferring expanded authority to the Board and the Department of the Inspector General to exercise certain duties and responsibilities, including the authority to develop administrative rules; receive, initiate, review, and cause the investigation of complaints of misconduct; make recommendations on resolutions of complaints; make recommendations on discipline; and in specific circumstances, to subpoena witnesses and evidence; and to declare an emergency.
