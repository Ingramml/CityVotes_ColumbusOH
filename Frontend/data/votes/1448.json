    "description": "Title\n \nTo honor, recognize, and celebrate June 19, 2021 as Juneteenth in the City of Columbus.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Juneteenth is the oldest nationally celebrated commemoration of the ending of slavery in the United States; and\nWHEREAS, Juneteenth celebrates the Anniversary of Union Army General Gordon Granger’s General Order Number 3 issued on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that slavery in Texas had ended - the announcement came 2 years, 6 months, and 19 days after President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation ending slavery on January 1, 1863; and\nWHEREAS, Today Juneteenth commemorates African American freedom and emphasizes education and achievement - it is a time for reflection and rejoicing; for assessment, self-improvement and planning for the future; and\nWHEREAS, Juneteenth reminds us that we continue to live in a world, which for more than 400 years continues to struggle to find liberty and justice for all; and\nWHEREAS, Juneteenth should not only be commemorated for the horrific institution of slavery which was embraced by our country, but rather we should use Juneteenth as an occasion to showcase the strength and success of the American spirit; and \nWHEREAS, Juneteenth is an opportunity to talk as Americans about our ability to recognize wrong and discuss how to go about making things right; and\nWHEREAS, Juneteenth discussions and exchanges should focus on equity and inclusion, moving America forward, and finding ways to level the playing field so that  all can achieve; and\nWHEREAS, George Floyd, in the context of Juneteenth, prompts us to remember that we are still tied together in a single garment of destiny, injustice to anyone impacts everyone; and\nWHEREAS, Juneteenth reminds us that we can still celebrate our country's greatness; it also reminds us of  how we can use our hearts to hear the voice of the voiceless; and how we can celebrate our ability to learn and work together for all that is good and just; now therefore,\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nThat this Council does hereby honor, recognize, and celebrate June 19, 2021 as Juneteenth in the City of Columbus.",
