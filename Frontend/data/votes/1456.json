    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) for the 2020 Clean Ohio Trails Fund Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of grant and matching funds. The grant amount is $485,000.00 and the local match amount is $121,250.00. There is a total of $606,250.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nIn February of 2020, the Department applied for Clean Ohio Trail Funds, as authorized by Ordinance No. 0426-2020, to build a trail connection to the Alum Creek Trail from Mock Road in the near Northeast area of Columbus. In March of 2021, the Department received notice that the grant was approved. The Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector will become a direct 1.2 mile connection for the near Northeast Community to the City’s regional trail system. The connector will be a 10 foot wide paved path from the Alum Creek Trail at Sunbury and Mock Road, heading west. It will connect directly to the City’s new Hudson Street Greenway, opening a seamless 3.5 mile east/west trail from Interstate 71, near the proposed Community Sports Park, to the Alum Creek Trail. By linking these two east/west projects, over 6,000 residents of the Arlington Park, Woodland Holt, Brittany Hills, Argyle Park, and East Linden neighborhoods will be within 10 minutes of walking and biking connectivity to parks, churches, schools, retail, and jobs. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources \n2045 Morse Road, Columbus, OH  43229\nD’Juan Hammonds, 614-256-6417, Division of Real Estate\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005089, 31-1334820 \nExpiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)                                                               \n     \nBenefits to the Public: The near Northeast area of Columbus lacks safe, significant open spaces and parks. The timing of constructing a greenway trail along Mock Road and Parkwood Avenue ties directly to the City’s goal of providing a benefit to inner city neighborhoods cut off from safe, easy access to greenways and outdoor experiences.  The scale of construction costs estimated in this project relies heavily upon outside funding assistance being provided by the Clean Ohio Trails Fund to achieve these goals.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Letters of Support for this project were received from non-profit organizations, residents, a school principal, and the Central Ohio Greenways Board.  Further public engagement will be underway during the Fall of 2021 as the project team holds open houses, online survey(s), social media, and key stakeholder meetings.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Northeast (41)\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing equitable and safe access to the City’s trail system for underserved communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $485,000.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. This ordinance will also authorize a grant match of $121,250.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. $121,250.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this grant match. There is a total of $606,250.00 available for this project. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once construction is ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for the 2020 Clean Ohio Trails Fund Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector Project and accept a grant in the amount of $485,000.00 with a minimum local match of $121,250.00; to authorize the appropriation of $485,000.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283; to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget Ordinance; and to authorize the transfer of $121,250.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
