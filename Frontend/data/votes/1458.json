    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with American Structurepoint for professional design services for the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $892,774.00.\n \nThe central 0.6 mile segment of the Olentangy Trail, between Northmoor Park and Clinton Como Park, was never completed, forcing users to leave the trail and use a 1 mile signed on-street route travelling on 5 different streets.  The route is widely recognized as difficult to navigate, congested, narrow, and unsafe.  The route includes constricted sections where combined two-way car and trail traffic is on 11 feet to 13 feet wide pavement. This project will complete this final trail gap by designing and constructing a crossing of the Olentangy River at Northmoor Park, travelling along the west bank of the river. At North Broadway, the trail will use an enhanced bike/pedestrian crosswalk and signal to the new Ohio Health Campus. The trail will then continue south and cross the river to Clinton Como Park where it rejoins the existing trail. Ordinance 1319-2020 authorized the contract for Stage 1 Preliminary Design. This modification will complete the Stage 2 Detailed Design phase of the project. The project is scheduled for construction in 2023.\n \nThe Olentangy Trail is Central Ohio’s most heavily used greenway trail. Recent trail count data shows over 4 million trail miles per year are traveled on this path. In 2018, Recreation and Parks applied for and received grant funding from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) to construct the final gap of the 14 mile Olentangy Trail, from Northmoor Park to Clinton Como Park. The grant funds and local match will be appropriated at a later date, when construction is ready to move forward, as the grant funding can only be used for construction. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nAmerican Structurepoint\n2550 Corporate Exchange Drive\nColumbus, OH 43231\nTom Hibbard, (614) 901-2235, thibbard@structurepoint.com\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 007019, 35-1127317\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 1, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the MORPC grant funding schedule for this project requires that the consultant be into detailed design by the end of July of 2021, so that the project can be ready to construct in 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year round benefits to urban lifestyles. Access to trails and to key destinations is one of the top rated active transportation priorities noted by Columbus residents. Over 30,000 residents, 100 businesses, 6 parks, and 15 schools are within the trailshed of this project.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The department received letters of support from the community, the Clintonville Area Commission, Ohio Health, private developers, and citywide from trail users. A public open house was held in early 2021, with over 230 attendees. The public involvement provided 5 alternative alignments for the path. Over 450 comments were also received via website, letters, emails, and voicemails.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Olentangy West (38), Clintonville (39) - All Columbus and regional trail users will benefit from these improvements\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides safe east/west connections for nearby neighborhoods to the regional trail network.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $271,252.00 was legislated for the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project by Ordinance 1319-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $892,774.00. $892,774.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,164,026.00\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with American Structurepoint for the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project; to authorize the transfer of $892,774.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $892,774.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
