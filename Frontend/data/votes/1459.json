    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Columbus Asphalt Paving for construction of the Olentangy Trail - Worthington Hills Extension Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $28,893.28.\n \nIn 2019, the Department contracted with Columbus Asphalt Paving to construct a 0.35 mile extension of the Olentangy Trail from Worthington Hills Park to Clubview Boulevard, as approved by Ordinance 1573-2019. During construction, additional drainage structures, native tree and shrub plantings, and concrete curbs were identified as needed, requiring an additional $28,893.28 in funding. Of note, The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) provided Recreation and Parks with a $250,000.00 grant towards the total construction costs of this project. With this modification, the total costs of the project for Recreation and Parks will be $74,227.63 of the $324,227.63 total. \n \nThe Olentangy Trail is Central Ohio’s most heavily used greenway trail.  Recent trail count data shows over 4 million trail miles per year are traveled on this path. The Worthington Hills trail extension was completed and opened in June of 2020.  Since then, thousands of users have used the extension for access to and from the 14 mile regional trail.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nColumbus Asphalt Paving, Inc.\n1196 Technology Drive\nGahanna, OH 43230                                                    \nKevin Power (614) 759-9800                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004394, 31-0857095\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 4, 2021\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the ODOT grant funding schedule for this project asks that grant reimbursement requests be submitted by the end of July 2021.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year round benefits to urban lifestyles. Access to trails and to key destinations is one of the top rated active transportation priorities noted by Columbus residents. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Involvement was performed with the local residents, the Far Northwest Community, and business owners during the design process.  The Community was provided alternatives and best practices for safely integrating trail users into a busy commercial area fronted by a high traffic roadway. The final design reflected input from all stakeholders input on the connection and route of the project.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far Northwest (31) - All Columbus and regional trail users will benefit from these improvements\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides safe east/west connections for nearby neighborhoods to the regional trail network.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $295,334.35 was legislated for the Olentangy Trail - Worthington Hills Extension Project by Ordinance 1573-2019. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $28,893.28. $28,893.28 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
