    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nTo make sure our children are ready for kindergarten, the Department of Education uses different tools and collaborates with certain organizations in the preparation of our children. Ready4Success (R4S), administered by the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at the Ohio State University, uses a multi-pronged strategy to support providers in preparing children for Kindergarten success. The goal of the R4S initiative is to improve children’s outcomes and kindergarten readiness.  It does so by focusing on the instructional practices of pre-kindergarten teachers.\n \nFor the 2021-2022 academic year, the Crane Center staff will also develop and implement Read It Again (RIA), an evidence-based, low-cost instructional supplement designed to promote intentional teaching practices in early childhood education programs serving children from birth to age five.  Developing, implementing, and offering RIA to all early childhood providers is aligned with, and is an early strategy of, the Future Ready By Five Strategic Plan driver one:  providing development and education supports for all children.\n \nTherefore, the Department of Education requests permission to contract with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at the Ohio State University to provide this crucial work.\n \nThis contract is being awarded pursuant to CCC Section 329, which allows for the City to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts. The Department of Education chose the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at The Ohio State University because there is no employee expertly positioned to do this work in the city. For the past four school years, the Department has contracted and partnered with the Crane Center to expand the Early Start Columbus Program and we see that there is no other entity with the experience and expertise for the program.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract ($360,000.00) is available within the 2021 Department of Education General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Education to enter into a contract with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at The Ohio State University to implement Ready4Success, a screening and improvement strategy, and Read It Again, an early strategy of the Future Ready By Five Strategic Plan; and to authorize the expenditure of $360,000.00 from the General Fund. ($360,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Mayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten; and \n \nWHEREAS, to make sure our children are ready for kindergarten, the Department of Education uses different tools and collaborates with certain organizations; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ready4Success uses a multi-pronged strategy to support providers in preparing children for Kindergarten success; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ready4Success improves children’s outcomes by focusing on the instructional practices of teachers; and \n \nWHEREAS, Read It Again is an early strategy of the Future Ready By Five Strategic Plan; and \n \nWHEREAS, this contract is being awarded pursuant to City Code Chapter 329, which allows for the City to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts and there is no city employee expertly positioned to do this work within the city; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Education to authorize the Director to enter into contract with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy for the public health, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Education is authorized to enter into a contract with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at the Ohio State University for the implementation of the Ready4Success and Read It Again programs. \n \nSECTION 2.                     That the expenditure of $360,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized to be expended from the General Fund as follows:  (See attachment 1408-2021 EXP)\n \nDiv.: 42-01 | Fund: 1000 | SubFund: 100010 | Obj.
