In addition, the proposed project will greatly improve the aesthetics of the affected areas.\n \nBID INFORMATION: The selection of the firm providing the professional engineering services has been performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Columbus City Code, Section 329, \"Awarding professional service contracts through requests for proposals.\" The evaluation criteria for this contract included: 1.
