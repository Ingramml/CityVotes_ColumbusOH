    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify a contract for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Surveillance Lab to provide for the establishment of price schedules both now, and in the future as may be needed, to provide testing and lab analysis of samples and analytical services to The Ohio State University.  ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities, to modify a current contract to provide for the establishment of additional price schedules both now, and in the future as may be needed, for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Surveillance Lab to provide the testing and lab analysis of samples and analytical services for The Ohio State University (OSU) while Heidelberg University’s Lab is closed.  It has been determined that not all testing and lab analysis on which the original per sample contract price was based is needed, and it is necessary to establish price schedules based on the actual services rendered.  This work will support two separate research projects.  The first project is a study looking at how land use affects water quality, and includes sampling in the Dayton metro area as well as in Battelle-Darby Metro Park.  The second project is related to sampling of water quality through laboratory soil columns that approximate conditions that we’d expect in the bio-retention filters that have been built in Clintonville.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Division of Sewerage and Drainage will establish a price schedule for testing and lab analysis per sample processed.  The fees provided by The Ohio State University will offset the cost of providing the service.  Revenues are not significantly impacted by this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify a contract for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Surveillance Lab to provide for the establishment of price schedules both now, and in the future as may be needed, to provide testing and lab analysis of samples and analytical services to The Ohio State University.  ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Ohio State University has two separate research projects that need to have testing and lab analysis services performed on samples and analytical services provided.  The first project will study how land use affects water quality and the second project relates to sampling of water quality through laboratory soil columns that approximate conditions that we’d expect in the bio-retention filters that have been built in Clintonville; and\n \nWHEREAS, Heidelberg University’s lab usually performs this service but it is currently closed; and \n \nWHEREAS, because of this closure The Ohio State University and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Surveillance Lab executed a contract pursuant to Ordinance No. 1273-2020, passed June 15, 2020 to perform this service until such time as Heidelberg University’s lab reopens and can begin performing this service again; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has been determined that not all testing and lab analysis on which the original per sample contract price was based is needed, and it is necessary to establish price schedules based on the actual services rendered and it is necessary to modify the current contract to allow for the establishment of additional prices both now, and in the future as may be needed; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify a contract to provide for the establishment of price schedules based on the actual services rendered both now, and in the future as may be needed, to allow the Surveillance Lab to provide testing and lab analysis of samples and analytical services to The Ohio State University, for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities be and is hereby authorized to modify a contract to provide for the establishment of price schedules based on the actual services rendered both now, and in the future as may be needed, to allow for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Surveillance Lab to provide testing and lab analysis of samples and analytical services to The Ohio State University.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
