The DAS section's mission is to enable and encourage City departments to manage, share, and publish data that unleashes public and private sector innovation with open data and empowers data driven decision-making throughout the City.\n \nTalend Data Fabric is the City’s enterprise data integration tool that enables DoT Data Engineers to develop real-time and batch data integrations between existing lines-of-business applications deployed by various city departments. Talend Data Fabric streamlines the process of designing, developing, and deploying data integration jobs, web services, and data quality routines. DoT now wishes to acquire additional services as part of a planned enhancement/expansion.\n \nBecause this is a multi-year phased and time-consuming project, and because the end date is not known, the term of the contract authorized by this ordinance will begin on the date of a confirmed purchase order(s) by the City Auditor’s Office and end at the conclusion of the project. It is not subject to renewal.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $441,865.55 for the above-described purpose.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds to cover the costs of the services associated with this ordinance have been identified and are available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating and Capital Improvement Funds.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Talend\nF.I.D/CC#: 06-1807693 - Expiration Date 6-2-2023 \nDAX Vendor #: - 035901\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency legislation is requested to facilitate prompt contract execution and related payment for services.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Talend for services and support related to the on-going Data Management Platform project; to authorize the expenditure of $441,865.55 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating and Capital Funds, and to declare an emergency.
