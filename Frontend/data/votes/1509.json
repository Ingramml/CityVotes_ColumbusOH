    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 1449-2020, passed July 06, 2020, authorized the City of Columbus (“CITY”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with 1489 Rohr Holding, LLC (the “ENTERPRISE”) for a tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of roughly $12,600,000 in real property improvements and the creation of four (4) net new permanent full-time positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately 124,800 related to the construction of a new 550,000-square-foot speculative industrial distribution and warehouse facility (the “PROJECT”) located at 1279 and 1489 Rohr Road, Columbus Ohio 43137, parcel numbers 495-266702, 495-266703 and 495-266704 (the “PROJECT SITE”), within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone.  The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective December 23, 2020 with this PROJECT expected to begin November 2020 with all real property improvements expected to be completed by March 2022, with the abatement to begin no later than 2025 nor extend beyond 2034.\n \nIn a letter received by the Department of Development dated June 16, 2021, and through ensuing correspondence, it was requested that the PROJECT be revised to align with the company’s new development strategy. The ENTERPRISE now proposes to invest a total project cost of approximately $25 million in real property improvements to construct a new speculative industrial distribution and warehouse facility consisting of approximately 1,000,000 square feet at the PROJECT SITE, which is double the investment cost and size of the original PROJECT.  The ENTERPRISE is requesting the City to amend the current AGREEMENT to reflect the company’s revised project scope and development strategy.  \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time by revising the project scope to (i) change the total project investment from approximately $12.6 million in real property improvements to approximately $25 million, and (ii) change the proposed speculative distribution and warehouse facility square footage from 550,000 square feet to approximately $1,000,000 square feet.  \n \nThis legislation is being presented as an emergency measure in order for this amendment to be legislated in as expedient a manner as possible so that this amendment to the AGREEMENT can be executed and ensure that ENTERPRISE remains in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Enterprise Zone Agreement.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement with 1489 Rohr Holding, LLC for the first time by revising the project scope to change the total project investment from approximately $12.6 million in real property improvements to $25 million and change the proposed total square footage of the speculative industrial and warehouse facility from approximately 550,000 square feet to approximately 1,000,000 square feet, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus (“CITY”) entered into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with 1489 Rohr Holding, LLC and was approved by Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”) on July 6, 2020 by Ordinance No. 1449-2020 with this AGREEMENT made and entered into effective December 23, 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, the AGREEMENT granted a 75%/10-Year tax abatement on real property improvements; and\n \nWHEREAS, the incentive was granted in consideration of a total capital investment of approximately $12,600,000 in real property improvements and the creation of four (4) net new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $124,800 related to the construction of a new 550,000-square-foot speculative distribution and warehouse facility (the “PROJECT”) located at 1279 and 1489 Rohr Road, Columbus, Ohio 43137, parcel numbers 495-266702, 495-266703 and 495-266704 (the “PROJECT SITE”), within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone.
