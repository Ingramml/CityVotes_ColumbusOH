This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate an additional $12,400.00 in grant monies to fund the Prevention Block Grant (State) from ADAMH for the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021.  The total amount funded for this period is $2,453,244.00.\n \n \nThe Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Prevention Program will serve approximately 5,487 unique clients, who may receive multiple services, through Columbus City Schools, After School/Summer programs, Latina Prevention programming, HIV/Early Intervention sites, Parenting classes, and Recreation Centers. Of this number, approximately 2,855 adults and family members will be served; 1,832 children and adolescents through youth programming; and 800 transitional age youth will be served through youth mentoring, workforce development and programming. The ADS Comprehensive Treatment Program will provide treatment services to approximately 875 men and women through the provision of Biopsychosocial Assessments, Individual, Intensive Outpatient and Outpatient counseling. Due to the Pandemic and the necessity of maintaining smaller group numbers our projections may change throughout the year. 69% of the population to be served are men and 31% will be women. The Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program is projected to serve 45 unique clients who will be prescribed Suboxone or Vivitrol.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible to maintain the clients' continuity of care.
