    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  \nSince 2014, the City, under the leadership of then-City Council President and now Mayor Andrew J. Ginther, has invested time and resources to address and reduce the infant mortality rate in Franklin County through the collaborative effort called CelebrateOne.  Upon establishment, CelebrateOne programming was administered under Columbus Public Health.  In 2017, to further prioritize the work of this initiative under the administration, CelebrateOne programming transferred from Columbus Public Health to the Office of the Mayor (division 40-01) via 0982-2017.  Now, to better structurally align personnel, programming, and funding for the future, this legislation formally establishes the Office of CelebrateOne (division 40-05) within the Office of the Mayor. \nAs such, this ordinance amends Chapter 211 of Columbus City Code by enacting section 211.05 as the establishment of the Office of CelebrateOne within the Office of the Mayor.  The Office of CelebrateOne shall be responsible for the continued and collaborative effort to address and reduce the infant mortality rate in Franklin County.  The Office of CelebrateOne shall consist of a director and other staff members as authorized by the mayor and city council.\nEmergency:  This legislation is being submitted as emergency to allow for proper accounting of this office and to allow for as little interruption in services as possible.\nFiscal Impact:  CelebrateOne is currently funded by the Office of the Mayor’s general fund allocation as well as private and government grants, and most recently, by various federal funds related to the city’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In creating this office, authority for unencumbered budget balances in the general fund, as well as future expenditures in that fund, is being transferred to the Office of CelebrateOne.  However, all current general fund encumbrances, contracts, obligations, etc. currently established in division 40-01 for CelebrateOne will remain in division 40-01 until spend down, cancellation, and/or expiration.  Likewise, all current year general fund expenses that have already occurred prior to the effective date of the establishment of the Office of CelebrateOne, and associated with CelebrateOne, will remain in division 40-01.  \nAll current grant funding and federal funding, encumbered or unencumbered, will remain in division 40-01 until spend down, cancellation, close out, and/or year-end lapse.  All future appropriations and encumbrances related to grant funding or other funding will be established in division 40-05.  \nThe Office of the Mayor’s general fund will be reduced by a total not to exceed $815,880.  This amount will be established under the account coding for the Office of CelebrateOne within the general fund appropriation to cover programmatic expenses for the remainder of the year.\nThere is no petty cash account to transfer, and no fixed assets for which to account.  An accompanying authorized strength ordinance will be put forth to account for the transfer of personnel effective July 25, 2021.\nTitle\nTo enact Columbus City Code Section 211.05 establishing the Office of CelebrateOne within the Office of the Mayor; to transfer responsibility for the CelebrateOne initiative from the Office of the Mayor to the Office of CelebrateOne; to reduce the Office of the Mayor’s general fund appropriation by an amount not to exceed $815,880.00; to establish the Office of CelebrateOne’s general fund appropriation in an amount equal to the reduction to the Office of the Mayor in an amount not to exceed $815,880.00; and to declare an emergency ($815,880.00).\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, since 2014, the City has invested time and resources to address and reduce the infant mortality rate in Franklin County through the collaborative effort called CelebrateOne; and\nWHEREAS, in 2017, the administration further prioritized the work of this initiative by transferring it from Columbus Public Health to the Office of the Mayor pursuant to Ordinance Number 0982-2017; and\nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to create an Office of CelebrateOne within the Office of the Mayor by enacting City Code Section 211.05 to position it for the future, and to transfer funding and personnel from one division to another within department 40; and\nWHEREAS, through a reduction in the unencumbered general fund budget of the Office of the Mayor and subsequent transfer of the same amount to the Office of CelebrateOne, programming and expenditures in the general fund for the remainder of 2022 and beyond will be captured appropriately; and \nWHEREAS, it is further necessary to continue to authorize the Executive Director of CelebrateOne to have the authority to execute all current and future CelebrateOne contracts and administer of all current and future grant agreements; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of the Mayor in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the creation of the Office of CelebrateOne and to transfer associated programming, unencumbered general fund balances, financial responsibility, and personnel to it to allow for as little interruption in services as possible, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS OHIO:\nSECTION 1.  That Columbus City Code Chapter 211 is hereby supplemented by the enactment of new Section 211.05, entitled “Office of CelebrateOne,” and reading as follows:\n \n211.05 - Office of CelebrateOne\n \n \nThe Office of CelebrateOne is established within the Office of the Mayor.
