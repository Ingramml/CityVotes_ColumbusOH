    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify a contract, on behalf of the Facilities Management Division, with Barclay Water Management for water treatment and remediation services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, occupancy levels in various facilities have been significantly reduced due to remote working by employees and reduced visitation from the general public. These reduced occupancy levels have in turn drastically lowered the throughput of water through various building’s water systems. A lower volume of water flow throughout a facility’s water system can provide an environment conducive to the growth of various water contaminants. \n \nAs such, the Facilities Management Division has partnered with the Human Resources Department, Division of Occupational Safety & Health to establish a program for the safe testing, treatment and remediation of City owned water systems. Due to Barclay Water Management’s expertise and partnership with local healthcare systems, as well as their skills, equipment, and experience it was determined that they are best positioned to meet the City’s needs. \n \nBarclay Water Management, Inc.
