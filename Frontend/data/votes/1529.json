    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety to modify the contract with Pro-Tow, Inc. (PO141174, legislated via Ord. 1593-2018) in the amount of $1,000,000.00  for the continuation of towing management services as needed for the City of Columbus and the Division of Police.  The Division of Police is responsible for the safety and welfare of the traveling public on all public streets, state routes, interstates, and waterways, as well as those endangered by parking violations, accidents and/or abandoned vehicles and watercrafts within the Metropolitan Columbus Area as well as on City-owned land. In an effort to improve the transportation network and access innovative technology, the City sought a smart solution to towing management services.  \n \nFour proposals were received and the evaluation committee determined that Pro-Tow, Inc. was the highest qualified bidder.  It is now necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify the current contract with Pro-Tow Inc. for the continuation of towing management, effective September 1, 2021 until August 31, 2022. This is the first of three available one year extensions, provided for in the original contract.\n \nBID INFORMATION: An evaluation committee comprised of representatives from the Division of Police, Division of Support Services, and the Department of Technology completed a review of the proposals submitted via RFQ007048, by Pro-Tow, Inc., Tow Logic, Bosch, and Auto Return.  The committee asked for presentations and ultimately decided that Pro-Tow, Inc. was the highest qualified offeror and should be awarded the contract.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: CC000415, will be updated by the time this ordinance has passed \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $1,000,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, from the 2021 Police General Fund Budget for the continuation of towing services for the City of Columbus and the Division of Police. Funds are budgeted and available in the Division of Police’s 2021 General Fund Budget for this purpose.  In both 2019 and 2020, the Division of Police spent/encumbered $2,500,000 for towing services.  The COVID-19 Pandemic and resulting stay-at-home mandates have resulted in fewer vehicles being towed over the past 12 months.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Police, to modify the current contract with Pro-Tow, Inc. and increase funds for the continuation of towing management services; to authorize an expenditure of $1,000,000.00 from the Division of Police's General Fund Budget.
