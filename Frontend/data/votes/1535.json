These improvements have positive environmental impacts and potential energy savings by improving the building envelopes, improving reliability of building mechanical systems and bringing facilities up to code, and addressing secure access for Watershed facilities.  The majority of the work will occur within areas that are not accessible to the public, so no community outreach is anticipated.\n \nCONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The Director of Public Utilities publicly opened two (2) bids on June 9, 2021 from R.W.

Setterlin Building Co.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There are sufficient funds within the Water G.O.
