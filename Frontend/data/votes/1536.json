    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Concrete Rehabilitation Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690389-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2141.\n \nThe goal of this project is to rehabilitate deteriorated concrete and related structural / mechanical items caused by natural deterioration (age), service conditions, and weather (freeze-thaw) conditions. \n \nUnder the Original Agreement, Hatch Associates Consultants performed Condition Assessment and Preliminary Design services.  \n \nContract Renewal No. 1 provided Detailed Design Engineering Services and Bidding Services for Phase 1 and Phase 2.\n \nContract Renewal No. 2 provided Engineering Services During Construction for Phase 1.\n \nContract Renewal No. 3 (current) is needed to provide Engineering Services During Construction for Phase 2.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” since the HCWP serves multiple planning areas.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,602,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $   741,300.00                     (PO019838)\nRenewal No. 1:                     $1,920,600.00                     (PO133389)\nRenewal No. 2:                     $1,307,900.00                     (PO182088)\nRenewal No. 3 (current):                     $1,602,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Renewals)                     $5,571,800.00\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nEngineering services during construction were included in the original RFP advertisement for which the Division received proposals on November 2015 from interested firms.   The current consultant has gained detailed knowledge of the condition of the structures that is essential for completing the detailed design and construction.  Bidding this work out to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the condition assessment and detail design work already performed, increasing project costs and extending the project schedule.\nAdditionally, renewals for Engineering Services During Construction was anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 1491-2016, under Renewal No. 1 under Ordinance No. 1795-2018, as well as under Renewal No. 2 under 1420-2019.\n \nHow cost of renewal was determined:\nHatch Associate Consultants Inc. and the City developed a scope of work for these services based on the previous work performed and estimated efforts for this next phase of work. Hatch then developed the estimated level of effort / fee to perform the agreed to scope.  The scope and fee were reviewed by the City PM and Hatch refined these based on City’s comments.\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project will rehabilitate deteriorated concrete around the treatment basins at the Divisions’ largest water treatment plant to prevent further and more costly damage that could occur if rehabilitation was postponed and to extend the life of this asset.  This project is part of the City’s ongoing efforts to maintain a reliable supply of safe drinking water to its customers, which will result in sustainable economic growth well into the future.\n \nPublic informational meetings are not anticipated for this project. All proposed work is anticipated to occur within the boundaries of the Hap Cremean Water Plant.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  20-2401674, expires 5/12/22, Majority, DAX No. 25646.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hatch Associates Consultants Inc.\n \nFUTURE CONTRACT MODIFICATION(S):  The Division of Water anticipates requesting a future contract renewal to continue Engineering Services During Construction for Phase 2.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Water G.O.
