    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Dynotec, Inc. for the Plant Drain & Water System Improvements Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690552-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2091.\n \nDesign conventions and best practices for building drain systems have changed since the HCWP and PAWP were constructed.  Currently, some drain systems discharge to undesirable locations or have the potential to mix incompatible chemicals, which does not meet best design practices and could adversely impact the environment or the drinking water supply when a chemical spill occurs.  Plant water systems at the HCWP, PAWP, and DRWP need various improvements to address corroded pipe/fittings/couplings/supports/restraints, to add additional pipe supports, to provide pipe restraint, and replace aging valves.  This project will modify the building drain systems to address these issues and will replace or modify various portions of the plant water systems to improve safety, reliability, and ease of maintenance.   \n \nWork under the original agreement included Condition Assessment & Preliminary Design (Step 1).\n \nContract Renewal No. 1 (current) will provide Detailed Design and Construction Bidding Services (Step 2).\n \nContract Renewal No. 2 (future) will continue to provide Engineering Services During Construction (Step 3).\n \nCommunity Planning Area: “99 - Citywide”; both plants treat several communities throughout central Ohio.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,300,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $   275,300.00\nRenewal 1 (current):                     $1,300,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal 1):                     $1,575,300.00\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe services were discussed and included in the original RFP. The current consultant has since gained detailed knowledge of the existing facilities, and has completed preliminary design elements.  Awarding this work to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the assessments and design work already performed, increasing project costs and extending the project schedule.\n \nHow cost of renewal was determined:\nDynotec and the City developed a scope of work for these services based on the previous work performed and estimated efforts for this next phase of work. Dynotec then developed the estimated level of effort / fee to perform the agreed to scope.  The scope and fee were reviewed by the City PM and Dynotec refined these based on City’s comments.\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project is necessary as various building drain systems currently discharge to undesirable locations (e.g. process stream) or have the potential to mix with incompatible chemicals.  Chemical drains discharging to process or with potential to mix do not meet best design practices and have the potential to adversely affect the environment or the drinking water supply. This project will also evaluate the Plant’s potable water system which is a critical asset of the Plant. The water treatment plants are an essential and integral component in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  \n                     \nWork will be conducted within secure areas of the water plants so no community outreach is anticipated.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  31-1319961, expires 1/31/22, MBE, DAX No. 5053\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Dynotec, Inc.\n \nFUTURE RENEWAL(S):  Contract Renewal No. 2 will continue to provide Engineering Services During Construction.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Dynotec, Inc. for the Plant Drain & Water System Improvements Project; for the Division of Water; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $1,300,000.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvements.  ($1,300,00.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO181572 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1351-2019, passed June 10, 2019, was executed on July 11, 2019, and approved by the City Attorney on July 19, 2019, for the Plant Drain & Water System Improvements Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal No. 1 (current) is needed for Step 2 - Detailed Design and Construction Bidding Services; and\n \nWHEREAS, a future Contract Renewal (No. 2) will be needed to continue Engineering Services During Construction (Step 3); and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Dynotec, Inc. for the Plant Drain & Water System Improvements Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to authorize a transfer and expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
