    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the neighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).  This contract renewal will provide the funding necessary to conduct additional public meetings and outreach, complete the designs of the GI and private property work as well as the assembly of the bid documents for each of the phases.\n \n*Note:  the original agreement was with Chester Engineers.  Chester Engineers' name changed to Hatch Associates Consultants, FID# 13-6094431.  Name change authorized under Ord. #1535-2019, passed 6/24/19.\n \nCommunity Planning Area = 62 - Livingston Avenue Area\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,155,244.89\nOriginal Contract:                     $1,799,990.29 (PO001067)\nRenewal #1:                             $  968,006.61 (PO209671)\nRenewal #2 (current):               $1,155,244.89\nTOTAL                                    $3,923,241.79                               \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis renewal was planned and identified in the original contracting legislation Ord.
