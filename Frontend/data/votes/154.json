    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase the payment funding for utility relocation work as needed by AT&T, American Electric Power, Columbia Gas of Ohio, and other utilities (or companies hired by utilities to perform utility relocation work) for the Intersection Improvements - Hilliard Rome Road at Feder Road (FRA CR03 12.96 PID 98557) project in an amount up to $384,000.00.\n \nThe Department of Public Service is engaged in the Intersection Improvements-Hilliard Rome Road at Feder Road project.  The project consist of the widening and resurfacing of Hilliard Rome Road, Feder Road, and Fisher Roads, adding turn lanes at the intersection of Hilliard Rome Road and Feder Road, along with the installation of sidewalk, ADA curb ramps, a storm water basin, new storm sewer, curbs and gutters, street lighting, and a mast arm traffic signal at Hilliard Rome Road and Feder Road.\n \nIn the course of effecting roadway improvements, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements or place overhead utilities underground to promote the public health, safety and welfare, including the economic development of the City.  It is necessary to move utilities to complete this project.  Ordinance 3157-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to pay for utility relocation work as needed by AT&T and other utilities (or companies hired by utilities to perform utility relocation work) for this project in an amount up to $440,000.00.  The funding request for utility relocation reimbursements is based upon estimates from the utilities.  The utilities invoice the City for actual costs incurred in relocating the utilities.  It was stated in Ordinance 3157-2019 that the amount needed may exceed the amount requested in the ordinance and additional legislation would be submitted by the Department of Public Service if more funding should be needed to complete the relocations.       \n \nAdditional funding in the amount of $384,000 is estimated to be needed to complete the utility relocations for this project.  The amount needed may exceed the amount authorized by this ordinance.  If this estimate should be short of the amount required to complete the relocations, an additional ordinance will be submitted for City Council approval to complete the relocations.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe estimated cost to complete the utility relocation work is $384,000.00.  The work is partially funded by a reimbursement grant from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) that has a 30/70 funding split of eligible costs, with OPWC providing the 30%.  Grant G591907 (Hilliard-Rome at Feder DCW02), Fund 7763 (Transportation Grants Fund) was established for this grant.  $115,200.00 will need to be appropriated within the grant for this expense.  The $268,800.00 needed for the City share is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, Project P530086-100027 (Intersection Improvements-Hilliard Rome Road at Feder Road).\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested to provide funding for utility reimbursements at the earliest possible time to maintain the project construction schedule.\n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the Transportation Grant Fund;
