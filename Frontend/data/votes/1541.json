    "description": "Explanation\n \n BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing engineering agreement with ms Consultants, Inc. for the Blueprint Columbus Hilltop Eureka/Fremont\nproject, CIP 650870-100802. This project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the\nneighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing\nsanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs),\nreduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).  This contract renewal will provide the funding necessary to finalize the engineering drawings and provide services during\nand after construction, and to provide services during construction for two construction contracts Eureka/Fremont Lateral Lining and Eureka/Fremont Downspout Redirection. \n \nThe project is located in the “53 - Greater Hilltop” Community Planning Area.\n \n Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,354,680.64\n Original Contract                                $ 1,956,247.00\n Renewal 1                                          $    916,844.15 PO188204\n Renewal 2 (current)                            $ 1,354,680.64 TBD\n TOTAL                                               $ 4,227,771.79\n \n Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification was planned at contract origination. \nReasons other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant. In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \n How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost estimate for the proposed scope of work was prepared by ms consultant and reviewed by DOSD.  \n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: It is anticipated that this modification will be for a term of 2 years.\n \nContract Compliance No.:  34-6546916 | MAJ | Exp. 1/28/2022 | Vendor #: 006998\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency designation is not requested. \n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: This project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the\nneighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer\nlaterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary\nsewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).  Community outreach is large part of these projects and the initial public meetings have been held.  Subsequent meetings with other interested,\nneighborhood committees have also been held to inform them of the potential changes.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $ 1,354,680.64 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align authority with the expenditure. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an existing engineering agreement with ms Consultants, Inc. for the Blueprint Columbus Hilltop Eureka/Fremont Area project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $ 1,354,680.64 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.
