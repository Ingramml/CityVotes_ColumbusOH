    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Resource International to add additional funds for design of the Resurfacing - Pavement and Asset Management 2019 project.\nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, with an experienced and professional consulting firm to perform a pavement condition survey, assessment, and inventory service on the entire City network consisting of approximately 2,100 centerline miles.  Data collected through the pavement condition survey will be used within Lucity to develop preliminary budgets, maintenance strategies, and aid in resurfacing planning/coordination.\n \nThe original contract was approved by Council via Ordinance 0681-2020 on 4/20/20.  It included an estimated funding amount to perform data collection of right-of-way assets if the Department of Public Service should decide to proceed with that work. These right-of-way assets include but are not limited to sidewalk, ADA curb ramps, curbs, signs, pavement markings, and traffic signals.  The Department of Public Service would like to proceed with this data collection.  The cost to perform this work will exceed the estimated amount included in the contract for this work, requiring additional funding to be added to the contract.
