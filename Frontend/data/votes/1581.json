    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Columbus Asphalt Paving, Inc. for pavement restoration at Fire Station 15 located at 1800 E. Livingston Avenue. This project will restore the driveway and parking lot pavement. The project scope includes concrete pavement replacement, storm sewer upgrades, and restriping.\nThe Department of Finance and Management, Office of Construction Management, solicited bids which were formally advertised. On June 24, 2021 the city received two (2) response (0 AS1, 0 FBE, 0 MBE,) as follows: \n\n\n\nCompany\n\nCity\n\nFBE/MBE\n\nAmount of Bid\n\n\n\nNewcomer Concrete Services, Inc.\n\nNorwalk\n\nEBOCC\n\nWithdrawn \n\n\n\nColumbus Asphalt Paving, Inc.\n\nGahanna\n\nEBOCC\n\n$2,044,165.00\n\n\n \nNewcomer Concrete Services, Inc. had a low base bid of $1,197,000.00. Due to errors and omissions on their bid, Newcomer Concrete Services, Inc. has voluntarily withdrawn their bid from consideration.\nColumbus Asphalt Paving, Inc. submitted a bid of $2,044,165.00. This bid was processed to allow for alternate cost proposals. Alternate cost proposals provide a base bid amount along with project add-ons that can be chosen by the City which allows for flexibility in terms of selecting a proposal that meets budgetary and timing constraints. The full bid was over budget, however, so the Office of Construction Management will accept the competitive base bid only for the alternate submitted for Fire Station 15 of 1-$265,000, Allowance 2-$10,000.00 and contingency of $50,000.00. The Office of Construction Management therefore recommends the bid award be made to the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder, Columbus Asphalt Paving, Inc.\nColumbus Asphalt Paving, Inc. Contract Compliance No. 31-0857095, expiration date November 4, 2021.\nEmergency action is requested so that the construction work can be completed prior to the asphalt plants closing in November.\nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $325,000.00 from the Public Safety Voted Bond Fund with Columbus Asphalt Paving, Inc., for the restoration of the driveway and parking lot at the Fire Station 15 at 1800 E Livingston Avenue. These funds are budgeted within the Public Safety capital budget. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Columbus Asphalt Paving, Inc. for the restoration of the driveway and parking lot at Fire Station 15; to authorize the expenditure of $325,000.00 from the Public Safety Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
