    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a construction reimbursement agreement with Franklin County Engineer’s Office for the Hilltop Camp Chase Trail Connection - Valleyview and Eureka Project. The City’s cost share for this project is $250,000.00 and this contribution is being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nIn 2018, the Recreation and Parks Department finished the Camp Chase Trail, a 3.3 mile regional trail, from Sullivant Avenue to Eureka Avenue. Between the end of the Camp Chase Trail at Eureka Avenue and the Scioto Trail is a 0.3 mile section of Franklin County streets where users must share the roadway with vehicle traffic as well as cross an active railroad line. This project will greatly enhance this condition by paving new 4 foot wide bike lanes along the berms of Eureka and Valleyview Avenues. A second major upgrade with this project is a new traffic-separated trail crossing of the Camp Chase Railroad tracks at Eureka Avenue. The current track crossing is narrow, unsigned, and in poor pavement condition.  The Franklin County Engineer’s Office have prepared the full construction documents, are providing the majority of the funds for the new pavement, and have negotiated a railroad agreement with Camp Chase Railroad. Franklin County Engineer’s Office will also bid, administer, and provide construction inspection for this project. The Camp Chase Trail is the major greenway for the Hilltop community and is also a section of the National Ohio to Erie Trail, a 326 mile pathway from Cincinnati, through Columbus, to Cleveland.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nFranklin County Engineer’s Office\n970 Dublin Road, Columbus, OH  43215\nBarbara Cox, (614) 525-3030\nGovernment Agency\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the County will be bidding the project in July of 2021 and construction is set to begin in September of 2021.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The project will provide substantial safety and visibility improvements, a functional trail crossing of an active rail line, and better access for thousands of trail users.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: This unimproved trail section has been recently rated as the top Trail Improvement Priority of the Central Ohio Greenways Network. The Department has been working on this collaboration with Franklin County for over 2 years.
