    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with ProCon Professional Construction Services, Inc. for the 2021 CDBG Shelter Improvements Project. The contract amount is $240,068.00, with a contingency of $36,000.00, for a total of $276,068.00 being authorized for this project by this ordinance. \n \nThe 2021 CDBG Shelter Improvements Project is focused upon providing safe and accessible recreational opportunities for families throughout the City. This project includes park improvements to three parks, including Hilltonia, Redick and Marie Moreland. All of the existing shelters have been in place for over 20 years and are being removed due to their poor condition. The shelters are being replaced in Redick Park and Marie Moreland Park. These worn shelters will be replaced with new shelters and site furnishings that exceed current accessibility standards. The project is expected to start in the Summer of 2021 and be completed by November of 2021.  \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were originally advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 27, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 8, 2021.
