    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with DWA Recreation for the 2021 CDBG Playground Improvements - Phase 3 Project. The contract amount is $412,005.33, with a contingency of $83,000.00, for a total of $495,005.33 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe 2021 CDBG Playground Improvements - Phase 3 Project is focused upon providing safe and accessible play opportunities for children throughout the City. This Phase will replace six playgrounds at Kobacker, Marie Moreland, Kingsrowe, Waltham Woods, Maybury, and Redick Parks. All of the playgrounds being replaced are over 20 years old and beyond their service life. These worn playgrounds will be replaced with new playgrounds that exceed current accessibility standards with updated rubberized safety surfacing. In addition, storm drainage equipment will be installed to address flooding. The project is anticipated to start in the Summer of 2021 and be completed in November of 2021.  \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 22, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 9, 2021.
