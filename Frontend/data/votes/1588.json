This Phase will replace four playgrounds at Millbrook, Hilliard Green, Hilltonia and Sullivant Gardens Parks.

These playgrounds will be replaced with new equipment and updated rubberized safety surfacing, which will substantially improve accessibility. One of the four play spaces, Sullivant Gardens Park Playground, will be specially improved to a universally accessible playground to encourage inclusiveness. The project is anticipated to start in the summer of 2021 and be completed in November of 2021.  \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 22, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 17, 2021.
