    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Proline Electric, Inc. for the 2020-2021 CIP Park Lighting Program Project. The contract amount is $486,951.00, with a contingency of $100,000.00, for a total of $586,951.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $588,951.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe 2020-2021 CIP Park Lighting Program seeks to provide LED site lighting to deter crime while increasing the safety and security in our parks. This year’s program is focused on Southeast Lions, Far East, and Holton Parks as well as the new futsal courts located at Sullivant Gardens and Blackburn Community Centers. There currently are no functional lights in the open shelter or surrounding area at Southeast Lions and Far East Parks, creating an unsafe environment for park visitors and staff. The lack of proper lighting also makes these facilities less appealing for use by the general public. This project will add lighting to these locations. At Holton Park, this project seeks to provide additional lighting along the creek for enhanced safety and security in the park. \n \nSullivant Gardens Park and Blackburn Park were recipients of the futsal mini-pitches from the US Soccer Foundation. The mini-pitches are equipped with light fixtures that are not presently connected to power. This project seeks to supply power to the mini-pitches at each location. In addition to power supply, the Sullivant Gardens project seeks to provide LED lighting for the nearby basketball court and general site lighting near the courts and the Community Center. In addition to the power supply at Blackburn Park, the project seeks to provide LED lighting for the tennis courts as well as sports court lighting at the basketball court. This project is anticipated to begin in the Summer of 2021 and be substantially complete by November of 2021. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on June 9, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 23, 2021. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nBase Bids (before alternates added to total):\nProline Electric, Inc., Inc. (MAJ): $364,927.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Proline Electric, Inc. was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Proline Electric, Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nProline Electric, Inc., Inc.\n1755 Victor Rd NW, Lancaster, OH 43130\nMark Gawell, (740) 687-4571                                                \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005491, 31-1487377\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: December 28, 2022                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow the project to commence and be completed expeditiously for safety and security reasons at these locations. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The addition of site lighting at Southeast Lions, Far East, and Holton Parks will increase the safety and security of these parks for the users and staff. \n \nThe futsal courts at Sullivant Gardens Park and Blackburn Park are highly used by the public. Providing power to the lighting fixtures will expand the use and programming opportunities of these courts, bringing them to full functionality as intended by the US Soccer Foundation. The courts were provided under the condition that the City of Columbus would provide the power to operate the lights. Also, providing sports court lighting for the tennis and basketball courts at Blackburn and Sullivant Gardens will expand play opportunities and keep the surrounding areas well lit for public safety.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: We have had many requests from the public on additional lighting at these locations. These requests are focused on safety and security in the parks.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Greater Hilltop (53), Franklinton (54), Near East (56), Far East (58), South Side (63)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by maximizing the use of existing recreational facilities for enhanced programming and offerings. Additionally, providing this lighting will create a safer environment for the park users while using very low energy LED lamps for the sports court and site lighting.\n \nFiscal Impact: $588,951.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Proline Electric, Inc. for the 2020-2021 CIP Park Lighting Program Project; to authorize the transfer of $588,951.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $588,951.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
