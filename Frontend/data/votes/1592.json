Over 1,000 residents live within a few minutes of this project and the development project will add 300 new residents once it is completed. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Greater Hilltop (53)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors.  \n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to formally exchange one parcel split of parkland within Alkire Woods Park and accept and dedicate two parcel splits from an adjacent private owner for additional parkland within Alkire Woods Park; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to grant temporary construction easements and a permanent drainage easement, and execute other necessary documents, serving the overall development of Allmon Run, by DR Horton-Indiana, LLC in the vicinity of Alkire Lakes Drive; and to declare an emergency.
