    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Safety to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Board of Commissioners for the purpose of providing financial assistance for the expansion of the County’s Gun Violence Reduction Initiative. In 2021, Franklin County is trending toward 1,200 illegal gun possession cases, which is a sixty-seven percent (67%) increase over 2015 levels. If current trends prevail, this will represent the highest number of Franklin County illegal gun possession cases on record. Unfortunately, there have been similar upward trends in gun related homicides and non-fatal shootings. In an effort to reduce illegal gun possessions and the gun violence that results, the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney is working to expand its personnel to effectively administer these cases and to provide options/programs for non-violent offenders. The gun unit of the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office currently staffs five (5) attorneys. Given the current pace, each prosecutor is anticipated to administer in upwards of 235 cases in 2021. This represents a 31 percent (31%) increase in case load since 2015.  \nThe gun unit of the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office attempts to impact the violent crime rate with each case administered. This unit assesses all available options, including determining if a misdemeanor charge is appropriate so as not to negatively impact employment or other opportunities to contribute to society. The Office also looks at Community Control, or probation, as an option for non-violent offenders. Of course if a defendant does pose a risk to society, the Office makes every attempt to protect the community from violent offenders.\nCity granted funds will be used by Franklin County to add two (2) additional prosecuting attorneys. The addition of these positions is anticipated to reduce (per attorney) case load to 168 and therefore allow for more effective case management. The Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office has indicated that their current case load far out paces many peer county caseloads in Ohio. For example, Cuyahoga County’s case load is approximately sixty cases (60) per prosecuting attorney. \nTreasurer Franklin County - Franklin County Board of Commissioners; Federal Tax ID# 31-6400067\nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes the transfer and expenditure of $200,000.00 within and from the General Fund with the Franklin County Board of Commissioners for the purpose of expanding the County’s Gun Violence Reduction Initiative. Funding in the amount of $200,000.00 is budgeted and available within the 2021 General Fund Budget.   \nEmergency action is requested so that financial support can be provided immediately and the expansion of the County’s gun violence reduction initiative can commence without delay.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Board of Commissioners for the purpose of providing financial assistance for the expansion of the County’s Gun Violence Reduction Initiative; to authorize the transfer of $200,000.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $200,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($200,000.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in 2021, Franklin County is trending toward 1,200 illegal gun possession cases, which is a sixty-seven percent (67%) over 2015 levels; and \nWHEREAS, in an effort to reduce illegal gun possessions and the gun violence that results, the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney is working to expand its personnel to effectively administer these cases and to provide options/programs for non-violent offenders; and \nWHEREAS, City granted funds will be used by Franklin County to add two (2) additional prosecuting attorneys and the addition of these positions is anticipated to reduce (per attorney) case load to 168 and therefore allow for more effective case management; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Board of Commissioners so that financial support can be provided immediately and expansion of the County’s gun violence reduction initiative can commence without delay, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Board of Commissioners for the purpose of providing financial assistance for the expansion of the County’s Gun Violence Reduction Initiative.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That the transfer of $200,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within Fund 1000 General Fund, from Dept-Div 4501, Object Class 10 - Transfers Out to Dept-Div 3001 Public Safety Director’s Office, Object Class 03 - Contractual Services per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSee Attached File: Ord 2058-2021 Legislation Template.xls\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of up to $200,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is hereby authorized in the General Fund 1000, in Object Class 03 - Contractual Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSee Attached File: Ord 2058-2021 Legislation Template.xls\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Sections shall be paid upon the order of the Department of Public Safety, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications. \n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
