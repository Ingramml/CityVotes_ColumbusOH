($44,035.20)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to modify an existing engineering agreement with Strand Associates, Inc. for the Blueprint 5th Ave by Northwest Edgehill/Meadow Project in order to add Public Service Urban Infrastructure Renewal Funds (UIRF) for sidewalk engineering services. \n \nThe consultants have conducted the required field investigations, property investigations, hydraulic modeling & alternative analysis to determine the preferred alternative.  The consultants have used this data to advance the plans to 60% design stage, and have conducted a public meeting to solicit stakeholder feedback.\n \nThis contract modification will provide additional funds from the Department of Public Service to provide design services for sidewalks to be constructed in conjunction with Department of Public Utilities proposed improvements in the Edgehill/Meadow project area.\n \nFuture work will concentrate on completing the project construction plans, assembling the construction documents, bidding the work and conducting engineering services during construction.  \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $44,035.20\n                     Original Contract                                          $    733,591.91\n         Renewal #1                                          $    972,134.55\n         Modification #1(current)               $      44,035.20 \n         Renewal # 2 (estimated)                         $    590,000.00\n         CONTRACT TOTAL                                          $ 2,339,761.66\n \nReasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nAvailability of Urban Infrastructure Renewal Funds (UIRF) from the Department of Public Service was not known at the time of contract origination, nor had Department of Public Service identified the streets to receive sidewalks as a priority for improvements.  Significant redevelopment has occurred within the project areas since project origination, therefore priority of pedestrian improvements is now higher than at the time of contract origination.\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-advertisement of these projects will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant.  In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nA cost estimate for the proposed scope of work was prepared by Strand Associates, Inc. and reviewed by DOSD.  \n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: It is not anticipated that these contract modifications will add any appreciable time to the overall contract duration of two (2) years.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n    \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  39-1020418 | MAJ | Exp. 10/4/2021 | Vendor # 007735\nECONOMIC IMPACT: These projects are being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  These projects will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the neighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  These projects will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).\n \nPublic meetings have been conducted to solicit stakeholder feedback for the proposed improvements, and subsequent meetings with be held to inform them of the potential changes as plans are refined and finalized.\n \nFor the sidewalks to be included in the construction as a result of these design modifications, the sidewalks will enhance pedestrian safety and increase walkability of the neighborhood.  Feedback for the proposed sidewalk locations was sought from the 5th by Northwest area commission and unanimous support was provided.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes the expenditure of $44,035.20 from the Streets and Highways General Obligation Bond Fund 7704.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities on behalf of the Department of Public Service to modify an existing engineering agreement with Strand Associates, Inc. for the Blueprint 5th Ave. by Northwest - Edgehill/Meadow Project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $44,035.20 from the Streets and Highways General Obligation Bond Fund. ($44,035.20)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the original agreement was authorized by Ordinance 2114-2016; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original agreement was renewed by Ordinance 1235-2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing engineering agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service to utilize UIRF funding for sidewalk engineering services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Auditor to expend up to $44,035.20 from the Streets and Highways General Obligation Bond Fund 7704; and\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to authorize the Director to modify an existing professional engineering service agreement with Strand Associates, Inc. for the Blueprint Fifth by Northwest Edgehill/Meadow Project for the preservation of the public health and safety; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
