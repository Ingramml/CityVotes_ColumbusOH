This project will construct a new directional ramp from south bound I-270 to east bound I-70, reconfigure ramps from north bound I-270 to east bound I-70 to Brice Road, add a collector-distributor lane east bound from I-270 to Brice Road, reconstruct a segment of Scarborough Blvd and add a cul-de-sac. This is the first construction project from the ODOT Far East Freeway study (PID 76997), with 3 more phases to follow. This project requires a shift in Scarborough Boulevard, therefore requiring ODOT to acquire a parcel of Scarborough Boulevard right-of-way for the FRA-70-22.61, PID 95639 phase 1 labelled “31B-WL” on the plans while also acquiring parcel “31-WDV” in the name of the City. \n \n2.
