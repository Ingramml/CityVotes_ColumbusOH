    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $160,000.00 of the 2021 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant (CHDO set-a-side) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, restrictive covenant, and bond grant agreement with Healthy Rental Homes VI, LLC to construct single family and duplex rental homes.  The total commitment to the project is $1,230,000.00 with the remaining financial support being provided by bond funds already encumbered.\n \nThe 15 rental units for which Healthy Rental Homes VI, LLC is seeking funding will consist of nine single family homes and three duplexes (six units).  The preliminary addresses are (note, the final house number may differ once the building permit is approved):\n \n1915 Gault St.\n1162 Bulen Ave.\n1145 Lockbourne Rd.\n1191 Lockbourne Rd.\n1072 S. 22nd St.\n856 Gilbert St.\n973 Gilbert St.\n783 Heyl Ave.\n952 Lockbourne Rd.\n1246-1248 S. 22nd St. \n1057-1059 Wilson Ave.\n1133-1135 S. Champion Ave.\n \nAll but three of these properties will be built by Unibilt Industries-a modular home builder located in Dayton, Ohio. The modular units will be delivered approximately 75% complete and set on full foundations. Healthy Rental Homes has engaged a general contractor who will complete all site preparations, construct the foundations, and manage the balance of work post-delivery. Once delivered, the units will require mechanical connections for electric, plumbing, and HVAC. Porches will be constructed on site and there will be some minor interior finishes to finalize. Lastly, the general contractor will pour concrete parking pads and walk ways, and each site will be fully landscaped with sod, bushes, and a shade tree. Upon completion, these projects will blend with the existing fabric of the community, and there will be no visible evidence to suggest that they are modular in nature. The three units that are not modular are Cape Cod style homes and will consist of traditional stick construction. \n \nIn addition to high-quality, affordable places to call home, the tenant families who will reside in these units will have access to a variety of supportive services and advocacy opportunities. Healthy Rental Homes recently hired a full time Tenant Services Coordinator to serve as a link between residents and health/social service providers and Nationwide Children’s Healthy Neighborhoods Healthy Families (HNHF) programming. The Tenant Services Coordinator will work to increase health knowledge and self-sufficiency of tenant families through outreach, community education, and referrals to community resources, social supports, and advocacy. More specifically, tenants will have improved access to health, educational, workforce and life skills development opportunities. Financial literacy, parenting classes and mental health services will also be emphasized. Service engagement will not be a requirement for the families that Healthy Homes serves, but it will be available to all households as needed.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the developer to maintain the project schedule.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 035856 and expires 5/25/2023\n \nFiscal Impact: $160,000.00 is available from the 2021 HOME grant (CHDO set-a-side) (G452000) and $1,070,000.00 is available on ACPO004519.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $160,000.00 of 2021 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, restrictive covenant, and bond grant agreement with Healthy Rental Homes VI, LLC in an amount up to $1,230,000.00 ($160,000.00 of HOME funds and $1,070,000.00 of bond funds) to construct 15 rental units; and to declare an emergency.
