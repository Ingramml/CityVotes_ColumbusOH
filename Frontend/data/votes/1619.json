    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Red, White & BOOM, Inc. to assist in mitigating the financial losses associated with the cancellation of Red, White & BOOM! in 2020 and 2021, and to help defray the costs associated with organizing, promoting and executing Red, White & BOOM! 2022.\nSince its inception in 1981, Red, White and BOOM! has grown to be the largest Independence Day Celebration in the Midwest and has become an open, inclusive and FREE experience for hundreds of thousands of people from across Columbus and central Ohio. Historically, the day-long event attracts nearly a half million people to downtown Columbus, making it the largest single-day event in the city. It is a tradition that celebrates the diversity of our community, while honoring military veterans and those who serve our city, state and nation. Red, White & BOOM! generates more than $10 million in economic impact to central Ohio annually, and has generated more than $150 million over the last 20 years.\nRed, White & BOOM! is presented by a nonprofit 501 (c) 3 organization, 92% privately funded with a volunteer board of directors. In 2020, Red, White & BOOM! was forced to cancel due to COVID-19 restrictions, but through creative planning, careful financial management and the support of presenting sponsors, the organization remained viable into 2021. The event was positioned to return and celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2021, but lingering public health concerns forced a delay, and after careful consideration the board of directors determined the best course of action was to postpone until 2022.\nThe City of Columbus has consistently provided financial support and served as an annual event sponsor for Red, White and BOOM! However, in 2020, the City was forced to reduce its financial support for the event. While the nonprofit organizers were able to remain solvent despite cancelling the event in 2020, ongoing operating expenses and loss of revenue from the event for two consecutive years threatens the organization’s ability to present Red, White & BOOM! in 2022 and beyond.\nThis legislation authorizes the Department of Development to enter into contract with Red, White & BOOM!, Inc. to provide one-time COVID-19 relief to mitigate financial losses associated with the cancellation of the event in 2020 and 2021, and to position the nonprofit organization to raise the additional private funds required to present the event in 2022. \nIt should be noted that in addition to serving as an event sponsor, the City of Columbus has, in the past, absorbed certain additional costs associated with presenting the event, most notably police and fire overtime required to maintain public safety. The Department of Public Service and Department of Recreation and Parks also incur costs in excess of fees charged to the event sponsor. Because Red, White & BOOM! did not occur in 2020 or 2021, the City of Columbus is likely to realize a net cost savings in excess of the direct financial support provided through this legislation, while assuring the viability of the nonprofit and the event itself in the immediate future. \nThe services included in this non-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\nContract Compliance:  Vendor number is 004781 and contract compliance is pending.\nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes the transfer and expenditure of $150,000.00 within and from the General Fund with Red, White & BOOM, Inc. for the purpose of mitigating the financial losses associated with the cancellation of Red, White & BOOM! in 2020 and 2021, and to help defray the costs associated with organizing, promoting and executing Red, White & BOOM! 2022. Funding in the amount of $150,000.00 is budgeted and available within the 2021 General Fund Budget.   \nEmergency action is requested so that financial support can be provided immediately and planning for Red, White,& Boom! 2022 can commence without delay.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an event support contract with Red, White & BOOM, Inc. for the purpose of planning, promoting and executing Red, White & BOOM! 2022; to authorize the transfer of $150,000.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($150,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, since its inception in 1981, Red, White and BOOM! has grown to be the largest Independence Day Celebration in the Midwest and has become an open, inclusive and FREE experience for hundreds of thousands of people from across Columbus and central Ohio; and \nWHEREAS, in 2020, Red, White & BOOM! was forced to cancel due to COVID-19 restrictions, but through creative planning, careful financial management and the support of presenting sponsors, the organization remained viable into 2021; and\nWHEREAS, the event was positioned to return and celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2021, but lingering public health concerns forced a delay, and after careful consideration the board of directors determined the best course of action was to postpone until 2022; and\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has consistently provided financial support and served as an annual event sponsor for Red, White and BOOM!
