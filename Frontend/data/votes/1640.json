    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a contract with Renter Mentor, LLC in the amount of up to $100,000.00 for the Housing for All Community Education Campaign.\nIn March 2021, Columbus City Council passed the Housing for All legislative package that amended Chapters 4501 and 4551 of Columbus City Code. The amendments address some of the critical affordable housing challenges within the City of Columbus by providing residents fair access and protections in the search for affordable housing. The three ordinances include:\n \nSource of Income Discrimination (0494-2021) - Operators are prohibited from denying prospective tenants based upon their lawful source of income, including but not limited to, income derived from wages, social security, supplemental security income, public or private sources, all forms of federal, state or local assistance payments or subsidies, including rent vouchers, child support, spousal support, and public assistance.\n \nRenter’s Choice (0495-2021) - If an operator requires a tenant to pay a security deposit, they must provide two alternatives to paying the deposit in full, including the payment of the security deposit over a series of 3 monthly installments, or the payment of the security deposit in 6 monthly installments.\n \nRental Receipt (0496-2021) - Operators must provide tenants with a written receipt upon payment of rent or a security deposit.\n \nThe Columbus City Council solicited proposals from community housing experts and providers in Central Ohio to receive a contract of $100,000.00 to provide a comprehensive community education and marketing program regarding the code changes. The intent of this project is to educate tenants and landlords on the rules and regulations associated with compliance and enforcement of the code, and also to engage the greater Columbus community on critical housing topics. \n \nA successful community education and marketing program will inform the public of the new policies; provide guidance to residents who seek to file complaints; and elaborate on potential penalties for operators who violate the code amendments. Strategies for engagement include public forums, social media marketing, television and radio advertising, and data collection.\n \nTwo proposals were received for the Housing for All Community Education Contract. A five person review committee of City Council staff reviewed the applications and recommended award to Renter Mentor, LLC, in partnership with Cohear and the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.\n \nEmergency action is requested because the code changes are already effective.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the General Fund Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nContractor Compliance: The vendor number is 038193 and expires on 7/1/23.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Renter Mentor, LLC for the Housing for All Community Education Campaign; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
