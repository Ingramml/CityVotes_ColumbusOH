    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $385,000.00 of the 2020 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio for five single family home projects.  Each home will have its own set of agreements and four homes will receive support in an amount up to $75,000.00 and one home will receive support in an amount up to $85,000.00.\n \nHabitat for Humanity MidOhio proposes to build five new single-family homes in the City of Columbus. Three of the homes will be on Aberdeen Avenue: 1541, 1545, and 1578 and two homes will be on E. 15th Ave.: 1049 and 1252.  The homes will be built to AWARE standards and are designed to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood.\n \nEach of the five homes will be two-stories and have four or five bedrooms and two bathrooms. They will have front porches and no garages. \n \nThe homes will be built on vacant property purchased from COCIC (1541 and 1545 Aberdeen, 1049 E. 15th) and the City of Columbus’ Division of Land Redevelopment (1578 Aberdeen). \n \nFirst-time homebuyers earning below 80% of the Area Median Income have been identified for each home.  The families in contract to purchase the homes include:\n-1541 Aberdeen:  A single mother of three.\n-1545 Aberdeen:  A family of eight. \n-1578 Aberdeen:  A family of nine.\n-1049 E. 15th:  A single mother of four.\n-1252 E. 15th:  A single mother of two.\n \nHFHMO has a 34 year history of creating safe, decent, affordable homeownership opportunities for low-and very-low-income families.  An affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, HFHMO has built, repaired, or rehabilitated more than 600 homes throughout their service area of Franklin, Madison, and Licking Counties. Their homes are typically sold to first-time homebuyers earning 30%-60% of the Area Median Income who are willing to partner with them by completing a homeownership education course and up to 200 hours of sweat equity work on their own home, as well as other Habitat homes. \n \nA unique aspect of the Habitat model is that they offer no-interest, no-profit mortgages to their buyers, making the homes affordable to families who would not qualify for traditional mortgages.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the developer to maintain the project schedule.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 004859 and expires 4/13/2023.\n \nFiscal Impact: $385,000.00 is available from the 2020 HOME grant (G451903).\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $385,000.00 of 2020 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio in an amount up to $75,000.00 for 1541 Aberdeen Ave., 1545 Aberdeen Ave., and 1578 Aberdeen Ave., and 1252 E. 15th Ave. and up to $85,000.00 for 1049 E. 15th Ave.; and to declare an emergency.
