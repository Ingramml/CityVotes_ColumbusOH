    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes a transfer of funds within the general fund for the Unleashing Potential (UP) court program in Franklin County Municipal Court Judge D’Varga’s courtroom. The UP program will provide transformative justice for potential emerging adults who have come into contact with our justice system and are at risk for continued criminal behavior due to lack of resources and a support system.\nEmerging adults, defined as individuals transitioning from childhood to adulthood between the ages of 18 and 25, are in an age category where cognitive skills and emotional intelligence continues to develop.  While emerging adults make up ten percent of the U.S. population, in Ohio, emerging adults represented 18% of total arrests in 2016.  Nationwide, emerging adults represent 29% of arrests.\nIndividuals in this age bracket can naturally age out of criminal activities as their cognitive skills develop when they are provided the support and opportunities necessary to become independent, productive members of their communities.\nUP is intended for justice-involved individuals’ age 18-25 years, with a moderate-high risk of recidivism and high level of criminogenic needs. Eligibility will be based on the nature and type of charges filed, as well as that defendant’s prior criminal history. Charges generally must be non-violent in nature, but cases will be considered on a case by case basis. The program would provide health and behavioral health services/trauma informed care, parenting services/support, successful navigation of public assistance programs, drivers licensing and transportation assistance, education and workforce development utilizing AMP (Achieve More & Prosper), safe stable, affordable housing, and family/community support.\nParticipation in the program is usually one year or longer, depending on the individual’s needs and progress.  To successfully graduate the participants must demonstrate adherence to their action plans.  Upon graduation, the case will be resolved pursuant to the negotiated agreement (either reduction of the charge or dismissal of the charge) between the prosecuting attorney, defense attorney and the court.\nThe goals of UP court program are to ensure public safety and reduce recidivism, increase the assets of young adults to help them transform their lives, provide justice involved young adults with a meaningful path to reducing/eliminating their criminal record, and to increase collaboration between the court, counsel, city agencies, community based programs, and other health treatment services.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes a transfer of funds within the general fund from the Department of Finance and Management to the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges, for the purpose of supporting the Unleashing Potential (UP) program which will provide transformative justice for at potential emerging adults who have come into contact with our justice system and are at risk for continued criminal behavior. Funding in the amount of $200,000.00 is budgeted and available within the 2021 General Fund Budget.   \nEmergency action is requested so that financial support can be provided immediately and the UP program can commence without delay.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize a transfer of funds within the general fund from the Department of Finance and Management to the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges for the purpose of supporting the Unleashing Potential (UP) program which will provide transformative justice for at potential emerging adults who have come into contact with our justice system and are at risk for continued criminal behavior; to authorize an expenditure of $200,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
