    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: The purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Development to enter into an Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with The Ohio State University (“OSU”), and/or other OSU affiliated entities (collectively, the “University”). The MOU will outline the plans and certain commitments of the City and the University relating to the major expansion of OSU’s west campus between Kenny Road to the east, North Star Road to the west, Lane Avenue to the north, and the southern boundary of the parcels south of Kinnear Road within the City between Kenny Road and North Star Road (the “Innovation District”). This innovation collaborative will be accomplished through a $3 to $4 billion capital investment of new infrastructure; 1,500 to 2,000 residential units; 100,000 to 200,000 square feet of retail; a 180 to 220-bed hotel; up to 500,000 square feet of medical; and 4 to 6 million square feet of lab and commercial office space over a period of twenty to thirty years. Of the more than $700 million currently in construction, the anchor of the Innovation District is the estimated $237.5 million Interdisciplinary Research Facility (IRF) that will house 305,000 square feet of space for a proposed five-story laboratory building, and adjacent to the IRF will be the estimated $47.1 million, four-floor Energy Advancement and Innovation Center. The Innovation District will increase opportunities for not only OSU but also other individuals, students, researchers, leaders, nonprofits, Fortune 500 businesses, and startups keen on innovation in order to meet the increased growth of workforce in City and throughout Ohio needed around innovation fields. \n \nIn consideration of the City’s economic development incentive commitments in the MOU, the University will commit to create up to 12,000 jobs with an estimated payroll of up to $950 million annually, and provide a capital investment of $3 - $4 billion dollars, in new infrastructure, at full build out of the Innovation District. In further adherence to the MOU and the City’s policy goals, within the Innovation District, the University is also committed to diversity and inclusive norms. The University will develop residential units within the Innovation District, of which will include 20% of affordable units, per City policy, at the time The University enters into a housing agreement with the City. Additionally, the University will implement good faith efforts to employ minority and women owned business enterprises for the performance of the work totaling a minimum 30%. Lastly, The University is committed to growing STEAMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics and Medicine) talent in the City. The University, in collaboration with Columbus City Schools and Columbus State Community College, are committing to engage K-12 students in learning about exciting STEAMM careers, garnering educational support to reach STEAMM career goals, thrive in STEAMM fields and increase competitiveness for higher education opportunities. \n \nThe Innovation District is also supported by a major share of a $100 million investment from JobsOhio, who will also split the funding with Nationwide Children’s Hospital. In order to provide additional local financial assistance for the University to develop a new flagship innovative economic engine at the Innovation District for not only Ohio and the University, but also the City, the MOU contemplates the City providing a new 40% Jobs Growth Incentive (JGI) for 25 years and establishing a new non-school 100% Tax Increment Financing (TIF) area for 30 years to assist with the funding of the design, engineering and construction of public infrastructure associated with the Innovation District. The plans and proposals of the MOU remain subject to authorization pursuant to the subsequent passage of additional legislation by City Council.\n \nFiscal Impact: There is no fiscal impact for this legislation.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is necessary to allow the University and the City to timely execute the MOU in order to begin the implementation of the plans and certain commitments in accordance with the MOU for the continued financing of the current and ongoing construction of the improvements within the Innovation District.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Department of Development to enter into an Memorandum of Understanding with The Ohio State University (“OSU”), and/or other OSU affiliated entities (collectively, the “University”) to outline the plans and certain commitments of the City and the University related to the proposed development of the real property located between Kenny Road to the east, North Star Road to the west, Lane Avenue to the north, and the southern boundary of the parcels south of Kinnear Road within the City between Kenny Road and North Star Road (the “Innovation District”);
