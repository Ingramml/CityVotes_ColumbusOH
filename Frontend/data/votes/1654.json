    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Columbus Fashion Initiative (CFI), in an amount up to $300,000.00, towards efforts to unify and strengthen the Columbus fashion ecosystem focusing on the Franklinton community.\n \nColumbus Fashion Alliance’s mission is to build a community and ecosystem that supports the launch and growth of fashion-based businesses and to lower the barriers of access for anyone looking to get into the business of fashion. Prior to the pandemic, more than 31,000 Central Ohioans are employed by the fashion and apparel sector with an average hourly wage of more than $44. With the current concentration of corporate apparel headquarters and employment of 8,300 individuals, Columbus sits as the top city among large U.S. metropolitan areas. The Columbus market includes many of the world’s foremost brands, branding and creative agencies, consumer research companies, and retail design firms. With greater access to the U.S. population than any other metro area-46 percent within a 10-hour drive-Columbus also ranks third in the country for the concentration of designers who live and work here: roughly 100 designers, 100 independent small business fashion entrepreneurs, and more than 1,000 models call Columbus home. CFI looks to advance Columbus’ position as a fashion capital by supporting the entire fashion ecosystem-from fabric and printmakers, to suppliers and distributors; from boutique retailers to large retail chains; from large scale brands and manufacturers to individual makers; from teaching artists to up-and-coming designers and students.  CFI achieves this through the following initiatives:\n•                     Small batch production.\n•                     Training, education, and workforce development.\n•                     Building a talent pipeline.\n•                     Supporting infrastructure, logistics, and fulfillment.\n•                     Leveraging partners across the fashion ecosystem to increase investment for fashion-based businesses.\n \nAs the program and contract are developed and if it is determined that this program is eligible to be funded by federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, the funding source will be changed and the program and contract shall be in alignment with federal guidelines.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds will be transferred from the General Fund Citywide Account to the Department of Development General Fund budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 031541 and contract compliance is pending.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Columbus Fashion Initiative, in an amount up to $300,000.00 towards efforts to unify and strengthen the Columbus fashion ecosystem focusing on the Franklinton community; to authorize a transfer within the General Fund in an amount up to $300,000.00; to authorize an expenditure of $300,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($300,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is a top priority of Columbus City Council to support efforts that build strong neighborhoods, promote the creation of good-paying jobs, and develop pathways out of poverty; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Fashion Initiative seeks to provide the community opportunities in the fashion industry through education and training programs, access to equipment, production space, and financial capital; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development desires to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Fashion Initiative towards efforts to unify and strengthen the Columbus fashion ecosystem focusing on the Franklinton community; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Fashion Initiative and make funding available to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services, hereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; ; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
