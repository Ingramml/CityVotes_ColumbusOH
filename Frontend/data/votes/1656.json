    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Tony R. Wells Foundation in an amount up to $4,500,000.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to provide fiscal agent and other services as part of the 2021 Columbus-Franklin County Small Business COVID-19 Response and Recovery Program and to pay for expenses starting March 3, 2021.\n \nOrdinance 1201-2021 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate approximately $187,030,138.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds as signed into law by the President of the United States on March 11, 2021.\n \nSimilar to the 2020 Columbus-Franklin County COVID-19 Small Business Response and Recovery Program implemented by the City and Franklin County in 2020 using CARES Act funds, the department (and the county) will partner with the Wells Foundation and Columbus State Community College’s Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) to provide economic support to small businesses negatively impacted by COVID-19 using ARPA funds.  SBDC will facilitate the city-county program and the Wells Foundation, acting as a contractor, will hold and disburse the funds to eligible businesses (as defined by U.S. Treasury).  A separate ordinance will be put forth to enter into an agreement with SBDC.\n \nThe not-for-profit service contract will include up to a 10% fee paid to the Wells Foundation for administration expenses.\n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will be modified while this not-for-profit service contract is in effect and it is requested that the Director of Development be given the authority to modify the terms and conditions of the not-for-profit service contract without seeking additional Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.\n \nThe mission of the Wells Foundation to “Create value for the community by developing stronger nonprofit leaders and investing in the next generation of social innovations”. The Wells Foundation focuses on creating value for the community through social innovation, impact investing, and leadership development. Since 2001, the Wells Foundation has worked with hundreds of non-profits and start up social entrepreneurs to help with fiscal management, business plans, organizational structure, social innovation, impact investing, and leadership development. The Wells Foundation was named “Foundation of the Year” in 2016 by the Association of Fundraising Professionals.\n \nThe services included in this not-for-profit service contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 11, 2021. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 038668 and expires 7/20/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Tony R. Wells Foundation in an amount up to $4,500,000.00 to provide fiscal agent and other services as part of the 2021 Columbus-Franklin County Small Business Response and Recovery Program and to pay for expenses starting March 3, 2021; to authorize the Director of Development to modify the terms and conditions of the not-for-profit service contract if necessary to comply with federal guidelines without seeking further City Council approval; to authorize the expenditure of up to $4,500,000.00 of ARPA funds from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency.
