SBDC serves an eight county region including Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Licking, Logan, Madison, Pickaway and Union counties.\n \nSBDC is part of America’s Small Business Development Centers, a national network comprised of over 1000 Centers across the U.S. including 29 in Ohio.  The Ohio SBDC Network provides one-on-one advising, by Certified Business Advisors, at no cost and conduct no or low cost business training. SBDC focuses on all industries and business needs from seed to maturity and everything stage in-between.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 11, 2021. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004263 and expires 7/20/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a subrecipient agreement with Columbus State Community College, through their Small Business Development Center, in an amount up to $500,000.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to provide program management services for the 2021 Columbus-Franklin County Small Business COVID-19 Response and Recovery Program and to pay for expenses starting March 3, 2021; to authorize the Director of Development to modify the terms and conditions of the not-for-profit service contract if necessary to comply with federal guidelines without seeking further City Council approval; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 of ARPA funds from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency.
