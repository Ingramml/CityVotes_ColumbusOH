    "description": "Title\nTo honor, recognize and celebrate Welcoming Week 2021 in Columbus, Ohio and declare Columbus a sanctuary for refugees from Afghanistan\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Welcoming Week 2021, which takes place September 10th through 19th, celebrates the growing movement of communities that fully embrace immigrants and their contributions to the social fabric of our country; and\n \nWHEREAS, Welcoming Week is an annual celebration bringing together thousands of people and a series of local events that celebrate the contributions of immigrants, refugees and new Americans, and the role our communities play in fostering a greater welcome. As we continue to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, this year there will be virtual, hybrid and in-person events in Central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, efforts that promote understanding and collaboration between all members of our community are crucial in encouraging and preserving the welcoming and inclusive environment of Columbus, Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, at a time when political rhetoric has deepened divisions and the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed anti-immigrant sentiment, Welcoming Week reminds us to double down on our inclusive vision and find new ways to bring together people across lines of difference to develop greater understanding and mutual support; and\n \nWHEREAS, recent developments in Afghanistan have resulted in U.S. troops returning to the United States after 20 years at war and thousands of Afghan refugees arriving here. Columbus City Council welcomes our Afghan brothers and sisters to Columbus, Ohio and will work to support local resettlement organizations in this important work; and\n \nWHEREAS, during this week of recognition, the City of Columbus, Ohio reaffirms its belief that the United States of America is a country open to all who seek refuge and the pursuit of happiness; and\n \nWHEREAS, fostering a welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, or place of origin, enhances the cultural fabric, economic growth, global competitiveness, and overall prosperity for current and future generations in the City of Columbus; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this Council does hereby honor, recognize and celebrate Welcoming Week from September 10-19, 2021, and the City of Columbus stands ready to support the support the evacuation and resettlement of Afghan refugees traveling with a Special Immigrant Visa",
