    "description": "Title\n \nTo Dedicate Purple Heart Way in the City of Columbus and to Thank Recipients of the Purple Heart for their Sacrifice\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, On August 7, 1782 General George Washington established the Honorary Badge of Distinction/Badge of Military Merit, which would later be referred to as the Purple Heart; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Purple Heart was the first military distinction reserved for low-ranking soldiers. Military honors up to this point in history had been reserved for officers and nobility; and\n  \nWHEREAS, After the Revolutionary War, the Purple Heart fell into disuse until it was revived by President Herbert Hoover to honor the men and women serving in WWII; and\n \nWHEREAS, In 1982, President Ronald Regan proclaimed the first week of August be recognized as Purple Heart Week to recognize the men and women of the United States Military, whom have received that distinction; and\n \nWHEREAS, The mission of the Military Order of the Purple Heart is to foster an environment of goodwill and camaraderie among combat wounded veterans, promote patriotism, support necessary legislative initiatives, and most importantly, provide service to all veterans and their families; and\n \nWHEREAS, Over 1.8 million members of the United States Armed Forces have been awarded the Purple Heart as recognition for their service and sacrifice to their country; now, therefore \n  \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby dedicate Purple Heart Way in the City of Columbus and expresses its gratitude to the women and men of the United States Military who have sacrificed to uphold the values and integrity of the United States of America.",
