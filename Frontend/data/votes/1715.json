    "description": "Explanation\n1.                     BACKGROUND:\nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, is engaged in the Traffic Signal Installation - Columbus Traffic Signal System (CTSS) Phase F project which is the sixth phase in a series of projects to migrate all Columbus traffic signals to a new central traffic control system.  This will allow the city to choose among multiple vendors for some of the commodities related to the Traffic Signal System and ideally receive better pricing for needed materials.\n \nIn the course of affecting the Traffic Signal Installation - Columbus Traffic Signal System (CTSS) Phase F project, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements. These relocations are in areas where the city has previously allowed utilities, but due to this project there is a need to relocate them at the city's expense. Utility relocation estimates are normally included in the budget for each project, but occasionally estimates are insufficient and not always in the city's control. This legislation provides a source of funding of $350,000.00 for utility relocations, some of which are yet to be named, in order to provide for quick turnaround of these relocations once the utility and project are determined. The utility relocation work includes design, review, and associated utility pole modification, replacement, or other required work to accommodate the Columbus Traffic Signal System (CTSS) fiber optic.\n \nTo date, American Electric Power, AT&T, and the Division of Power have been designated as utilities needing to relocate facilities. City Council recognizes this ordinance does not identify all of the utilities that will receive the reimbursements and understands that its passage will give the Director of Public Service the final decision in determination for such contract(s). This council is satisfied it is in the best interests of the city to delegate this contracting decision.\n \nThe $350,000.00 requested for this work is an estimate. Legislation requesting additional funds will be submitted for\nCouncil’s approval if the estimate should be short of the actual expenses.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds in the amount of $350,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, of the Department of Public Service’s 2020 Capital Improvement Budget. \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide funding for utility reimbursements at the earliest possible time, as the utility work will need to start by October 2021 so project construction can begin on time.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to reimburse various utilities for utility relocation costs incurred in conjunction with the Columbus Traffic Signal System Phase F project; to authorize the expenditure of $350,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bonds Fund to pay for the utility relocation costs; and to declare an emergency. ($350,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is vitally concerned with the use of the various rights-of-way areas in the City as such rights-of-way areas represent a valuable and limited resource that must be utilized to promote the public health, safety and welfare including the economic development of the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service requires funding to be available for utility relocation expenses for the Traffic Signal Installation - Columbus Traffic Signal System Phase F project in order to provide for quick turnaround of utility relocation work; and \n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes funding in the amount of $350,000.00 for that purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service to authorize the Director of Public Service to reimburse various utilities for utility relocation costs at the earliest possible time, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to pay utility relocation costs to various utilities for Traffic Signal Installation - Columbus Traffic Signal System Phase F project.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $350,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 7704 (Streets and Highways Bond Fund), Dept-Div 5913 (Traffic Management), Project P540007-100060 (TSI - Columbus Traffic Signal System Ph F), in Object Class 06 (Capital Outlay) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That City Council recognizes that this ordinance does not identify the contractor(s) to whom the contract(s) will be awarded and understands that its passage will give the Director of Public Service the final decision in determination for such contract(s).  This Council is satisfied it is in the best interests of the City to delegate this contracting decision.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
