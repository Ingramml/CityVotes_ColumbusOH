    "description": "Explanation\n \nColumbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health originating from the Centers for Disease Control and Other State Funds.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $132,000.00 in grant monies to fund the 2021-2022 Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Grant Program for the period of July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022.  \n \nThe Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Program will serve the entire city of Columbus, with approximately 893,000 residents. Services to residents include second hand smoke prevention, youth tobacco use prevention, vape education and prevention, increased access to current cessation services/providers, and media promotion to increase awareness and understanding around the dangers of tobacco use and current initiatives to prevent tobacco use.  \n \nAccording to 2018 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), nearly 1 in 4 Columbus adults currently smoke and the prevalence of smoking is higher in Columbus than Franklin County, 24.9% compared to 20.7% (BRFSS 2018). Current Ohio smokers who are African American (23.5%) or report as multiracial (37%) smoke at a disproportionate rate compared to those who are white. \n \nWithin high priority neighborhoods, which are neighborhoods where the residents face numerous social determinants of health, therefore facing a disproportionate rate of chronic diseases, the percent of adults who currently smoke is high: Linden (55.8%), Northeast (18.7%), Northland (25.7%), Hilltop (40.5%), Franklinton (51.9%), Near East (41.8%), South Side (42.4%), and Southeast (33.6%)  (Census Bureau, American Community Survey 5-year estimates, 2013-2017). Due to the high prevalence of smoking in Columbus, it is likely that the majority of residents, especially those living in the high priority neighborhoods, are frequently exposed to secondhand smoke.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so a delay in service does not occur since the FY22 grant deliverable reporting starts July 1, 2021.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is fully funded by the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City match ($132,000.00).   \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health for the Tobacco Use Prevention Cessation Grant Program in the amount of $132,000.00; to authorize the appropriation of $132,000.00 to the Health Department in the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($132,000.00) \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $132,000.00 in grant funds have been made available to Columbus Public Health through the Ohio Department of Health for the Tobacco Use Prevention Cessation Grant Program; and,\n  \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept this grant from the Ohio Department of Health, and to appropriate these funds to the Health Department for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health to meet deliverables and to appropriate these funds to Columbus Public Health for the immediate preservation of the public health, property, safety and welfare, and to avoid delay in client services; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $132,000.00 from the Ohio Department of Health for the Tobacco Use Prevention Cessation Grant for the period July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources for the period ending June 30, 2022, the sum of $132,000.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated to the Health Department, Division No. 5001 per the accounting codes attached in this ordinance. \n                 \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.   At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
