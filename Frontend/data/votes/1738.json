    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to modify a contract with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, to continue a community based peer to peer education program for teens in Franklin County. Funding was awarded by the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services with Ordinance 2465-2020. To complete the deliverables of the grant, CelebrateOne will contract with Planned Parenthood from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 for an additional contract amount of $100,000.00.  \n \nIn addition to having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation, Ohio ranks 23rd out of all 50 states for teenage pregnancies. Teen pregnancy is a significant contributor to prematurity, a leading cause of infant mortality, because pregnant teens have a higher risk for having a baby born too small or too soon.\n \nA recent examination of the National Survey of Family Growth revealed that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50% less likely to report a pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education. Currently, without any state health education standards, many teens in Ohio and Franklin County do not have access to comprehensive, medically-accurate sex education.\n \nThe Office of CelebrateOne, in partnership with Planned Parenthood, plans to reinforce peer education by engaging youth in Columbus City Schools from the CelebrateOne neighborhoods starting Fall of 2021. Peer education supports the development of healthy lifestyles and responsible choices by adolescents. Peer educators will receive training and incentives to increase their knowledge of essential, evidence-based sexual health information, establish important leadership skills, and gain the confidence to engage their peers and larger community in vital conversations.​\n \nThe original contract was established by Ordinance 1564-2020 which passed Council on July 20, 2020.\n \nEmergency Designation:  This ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure the grant deliverables are met within the required timeline. .\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This contract is entirely funded by a grant award from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services General Government Grant Fund 2220, Grant No. G502061.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to modify a contract with Planned Parenthood to provide teen peer to peer reproductive health education, and support CelebrateOne’s goal to improve reproductive health planning in its high priority neighborhoods; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the City’s General Government Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of the Mayor has received funding from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services to develop and implement a community based peer to peer education program for teens to encourage informed health choices and reduce unwanted pregnancies in Franklin County; and\n \nWHEREAS, Planned Parenthood was awarded the contract through the RFP process to recruit, train and support 50 teens to provide peer to peer reproductive education to teens in Franklin County; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract period is modified from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Office of CelebrateOne in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the contract with Planned Parenthood to continue to provide peer to peer teen reproductive education without interruption, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, is hereby authorized to modify a contract with Planned Parenthood in the amount of $100,000.00 for the time period of July 1, 2021 - December 30, 2021. \n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the cost of the said contract, the expenditure of $100,000.00 is hereby authorized from the General Grant Fund 2220, Office of the Mayor, Division No. 40-01 per the accounting codes attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Office of the Mayor, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the Funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
