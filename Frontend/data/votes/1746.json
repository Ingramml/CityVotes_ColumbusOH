    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Board of Health to extend the Focus Hepatitis C grant from Gilead Sciences, Inc. for the period of 7/1/2020 to 9/30/2021. As per Ordinance # 1575-2020, Columbus Public Health was awarded a grant from Gilead Sciences, Inc. The FOCUS Hep C program will allow Columbus Public Health (CPH) to seek to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with Hepatitis C. Additional Hepatitis C screening will be made available through the Sexual Health and Alcohol and Other Drug programs. Persons who screen positive for Hepatitis C through these programs will be referred to a Linkage to Care Specialist.  The client will be assessed for current health insurance status and enrolled in any available programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The client will be assessed for readiness to be linked to care. Persons ready will be referred to available infectious disease specialists.\n \nThe Grant Number of G502035 will remain the same. The grant period was previously 7/1/2020 to 6/30/2021 and has now been extended to 9/30/2021.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no fiscal impact as this is only to extend the award period.  The amount of the grant will remain the same.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to extend the grant agreement term of the Focus Hepatitis C Grant Program for the period of 7/1/2020 to 9/30/2021; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance # 1575-2020 accepted and appropriated $258,000.00 in grant funds made available through Gilead Sciences, Inc. for the Focus Hepatitis C grant program (G502035) for the period of July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to extend the grant period to September 30, 2021 for the support of the Focus Hepatitis C grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to extend the Focus Hepatitis C grant program term date, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare and to avoid delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.     That the Board of Health is authorized and directed to extend the grant agreement term of the Focus Hepatitis C Grant Program (COAP) Program for the period of 7/1/2020 to 9/30/2021.\n \nSECTION 2.     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City’s financial reports.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
