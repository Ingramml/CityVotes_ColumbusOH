    "title": "To authorize and direct the Board of Health to extend the grant agreement term of the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology Grant Program for the period of 8/1/2020 to 7/31/2022; and to declare an emergency ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Board of Health to extend the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology grant from The Ohio State University for the period of 8/1/2020 to 7/31/2022. As per Ordinance # 1888-2020, Columbus Public Health was awarded a grant from The Ohio State University. The Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology grant program will allow Columbus Public Health to work with local partners to conduct an intensive evaluation of an ongoing outbreak of sexually transmitted urethritis caused by a distinct, novel clade of non-groupable Neisseria Meningitidis (Nm).  The program will screen clients seeking testing for sexually transmitted diseases for Nm infection, and will answer questions about the population affected, the spectrum of symptoms experienced, patients' responses to recommended treatment, and the risk of Nm acquisition by sex partners and the risk of reinfection of cases.\n \nThe Grant Number of G502054 will remain the same. The grant period was previously 8/1/2020 to 7/31/2021 and has now been extended to 7/31/2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no fiscal impact as this is only to extend the award period.  The amount of the grant will remain the same.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to extend the grant agreement term of the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology Grant Program for the period of 8/1/2020 to 7/31/2022; and to declare an emergency ($0.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance # 1888-2020 accepted and appropriated $108,679.73 in grant funds made available through The Ohio State University for the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology grant program (G502054) for the period of August 1, 2020 through July 31, 2021; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to extend the grant period to July 31, 2022 for the support of the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to extend the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology grant program term date, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare and to avoid delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.     That the Board of Health is authorized and directed to extend the grant agreement term of the Neisseria Meningitidis Epidemiology Grant Program for the period of 8/1/2020 to 7/31/2022.\n \nSECTION 2.     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City’s financial reports.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
