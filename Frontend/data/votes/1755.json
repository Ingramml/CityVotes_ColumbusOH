    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \nThis ordinance authorizes the transfer of financials and fixed assets for the Division of Code Enforcement from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services.\n \nA recent citywide operational review identified that several of the Division of Code Enforcement’s activities align with, and are beneficial to, the building and development community.  To better structurally position personnel, programming, and future funding, this legislation will formally transfer the financial aspects and fixed assets of the Division of Code Enforcement from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services, assigning it the division code 43-02.  \n \nThis ordinance is contingent upon passage of accompanying ordinance 2328-2021 which amends various sections of the Columbus City Codes in order to effectuate the transfer of the Division of Code Enforcement from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services.  The division shall have as its primary duties the facilitation of the enforcement of codes and other duties as may be authorized by the director or ordinance of council.  In addition, ordinance 2169-2021 authorizes the necessary transfers of authorized personnel strength levels from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Division of Code Enforcement and Division of Administration.\n \nThe anticipated executed date of the re-organization is September 20, 2021.\n \nEmergency:  This legislation is being submitted as an emergency to allow for proper accounting of this division and to allow for as little interruption in services as possible.\n \nFiscal Impact:  The Division of Code Enforcement is currently funded by the General Fund as well as federal funds related to the city’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In transferring the division, authority for unencumbered budget balances in the General Fund, totaling so much as is available when the re-organization is executed, as well as future expenditures in that fund, are being transferred to the Division of Code Enforcement within the Department of Building and Zoning Services (division 43-02).  However, all current General Fund encumbrances, contracts, obligations, including internal service charges, etc. currently established in division 44-03 for the Division of Code Enforcement within the Department of Development will remain in division 44-03 until exhausted, cancelled, and/or expired.  Likewise, all current year General Fund expenses that have already occurred prior to when the re-organization is executed, shall remain in the Department of Development (division 44-03).\n \nIn transferring the division, authority for unencumbered balances in the Fire Escrow Fund, totaling so much as is available when the re-organization is executed, as well as future receipts and expenditures in that fund, are being transferred to the Division of Code Enforcement within the Department of Building and Zoning Services (division 43-02).  However, all current Fire Escrow Fund receipts and encumbrances, contracts, obligations, etc. currently established in division 44-03 for the Division of Code Enforcement within the Department of Development will remain in division 44-03 until exhausted, cancelled, and/or expired.   Likewise, all current year transactions that have already occurred prior to when the re-organization is executed shall remain in the Department of Development (division 44-03).\n \nIn transferring the division, authority for unencumbered balances in the Development Taxable Bond Fund, Project Number 782004-100003, totaling so much as is available when the re-organization is executed, are being transferred to the Division of Code Enforcement within the Department of Building and Zoning Services (division 43-02).  However, all current Development Taxable Bond Fund, Project Number 782004-100003, receipts and encumbrances, contracts, obligations, etc. currently established in division 44-03 for the Division of Code Enforcement within the Department of Development will remain in division 44-03 until exhausted, cancelled, and/or expired.  Likewise, all current year transactions that have already occurred prior to when the re-organization is executed shall remain in the Department of Development (division 44-03).\n \nThis ordinance also establishes an imprest petty cash operating fund in the amount of $500.00 for minor expenditures within the Department of Building and Zoning Services, Division of Code Enforcement (division 43-02).  The imprest petty cash fund for the Division of Code Enforcement under the Department of Development (division 44-03) will be correspondingly disestablished.\n \nFixed assets assigned to the Department of Development, Division of Code Enforcement will also be transferred to the Department of Building and Zoning Services, Division of Code Enforcement (division 43-02).\n \nThe Division of Code Enforcement is currently fully funded by the General Fund and a bond fund.  It has been determined that a significant portion of the division's activities directly benefit the building and development community and, therefore, 20% of personnel expenses are considered eligible for inclusion in the Department of Building and Zoning Services' Development Services Fund.  In order for the fund to absorb this additional cost for the remainder of 2021, a supplemental appropriation for personnel expenses of $470,210.00 is necessary in the Development Services Fund.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer of financials and fixed assets for the Division of Code Enforcement from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services, including establishing an imprest petty cash account for the division in the Department of Building and Zoning Services; to transfer current fund balances associated with the division as provided in the attachment; to appropriate  $470,210.00 from the Development Services Fund; and to declare an emergency ($470,210.00).\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, a recent citywide
