    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: In April of 2021, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Commission voted in support of and Columbus City Council passed a resolution to support the Columbus Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP) and its immediate implementation. By authorizing the implementation of the Urban Forestry Master Plan, the Forestry Section of the Recreation and Parks Department can implement key recommendations through hiring staff, purchasing equipment, procuring tree service contracts, inventorying the City’s street trees, designing a new facility for Forestry’s North Zone, and engaging urban forestry consultants.\n \nThis ordinance is requesting the authorization of $1,455,000.00 in voted bond funds and the authorization for the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various contracts relating to the Urban Forestry Master Plan. This ordinance will establish auditor's certificates and authorize expenditures in conjunction with the management of the UFMP. Contracts will be entered in compliance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329, however this legislation will set up all of the funding required to enter into contracts with vendors on an as-needed basis. All purchases will be through competitive bidding, through any current universal term contract, or through any current State of Ohio purchasing contract pre-approved by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office, per Ordinance No. 0582-87. \n \nWithin the total being authorized for the UFMP, this ordinance will also authorize the modification of an existing contract with Davey Resource Group to continue citywide street tree inventory. The expenditure of $239,250.00 was legislated for the Street Trees - Site Assessment and Inventory 2020 Project by Ordinance 2336-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by up to $300,000.00. The aggregate total amount authorized for this contract, including this modification, is $539,250.00.\n \nThe staffing, supplies, services, and equipment needs that will be paid for as part of this funding request may include, but are not limited to, tree installation, hazardous tree removal, stump grinding, tree site preparation, urban forestry professional services, cellular service, office supplies, forestry supplies, uniforms, and safety equipment. All supply, service, and equipment needs related to the UFMP have been established as one overall capital improvement project. Each purchase order will be written separately based on all City of Columbus Codes that apply.\n \nThe Columbus Urban Forestry Master Plan is the first citywide strategic plan to invest long-term in Columbus’ trees. Over the next decades, the UFMP will guide the entire Columbus Community to prioritize, preserve and grow our tree canopy. Tree canopy refers to the part of a city that is shaded by trees. Canopy cover is the percentage of the city that is covered by trees when viewed from above, as opposed to other land cover like water, open green space, hard surfaces and bare soil. In Columbus, approximately 22% of the city is currently covered by trees.\n \nColumbus faces many challenges today, and over the coming decades, and trees are part of the solution. Trees help reduce urban stressors by cleaning our air, providing shade, intercepting stormwater, and more. The benefits that urban trees provide is valued up to five times what it costs to maintain them. In Columbus, our trees provide approximately 38 million dollars in benefits each year. However, our tree canopy is vulnerable to threats from disease, pests, the changing climate and increased development. Also, the City is expecting to grow by 1 million residents in the coming decades. To improve and sustain our residents’ quality of life, we needed a strategic plan to invest in our trees.\n \nWe engaged residents across Columbus through five avenues, including an online survey, an open house, small-group presentations, interviews, and multiple meetings of two stakeholder groups. These two stakeholder groups were comprised of over 100 community leaders and City of Columbus Staff. The themes that emerged were used to develop the vision, goals, and actions of the Urban Forestry Master Plan. The vision of the Urban Forestry Master Plan is to prioritize, preserve, and grow the tree canopy in Columbus, equitably across neighborhoods, to improve the health and quality of life for all residents.\n \nThe Urban Forestry Master Plan has three goals. One is a long-term goal and the other two are short-term goals. All are critical to achieving our vision for Columbus’ urban forest. These goals are as follows:\n \nGoal 1: Reach Citywide Tree Canopy Cover of 40% by 2050.\nGoal 2: Stop the Net Tree Canopy Losses by 2030.\nGoal 3: Invest in Equitable Tree Canopy Across All Neighborhoods by 2030.\n \nTo reach our goals, we will follow four strategies, including community coordination and collaboration; best practices, dedication of resources, and stronger policies.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow immediate implementation of the Urban Forestry Master Plan, beginning this urgent work of prioritizing, preserving, and growing Columbus’ tree canopy. With challenges on the horizon like population growth, public health issues, and climate change, beginning strategic investment in Columbus’ trees immediately will ensure the continued health and safety of our residents.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Trees provide tangible benefits to Columbus residents. As the 15th largest city in the nation, Columbus is home to over 898,000 people. Columbus had the 8th most intense urban heat island effect of major US cities impacting health, energy use, and water quality. The recently published Columbus Climate Action Plan recommends planting trees as a solution. Street trees are the workhorses as they clean our air, reduce heat, and absorb stormwater. In an Ohio summer, trees provide the shade that makes walking outside bearable. Trees should be equitably distributed across the City so all residents benefit.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Hundreds of stakeholders helped create the Urban Forestry Master Plan. Industry experts, universities, nonprofits, developers, community leaders, city staff and leadership, regional partners, landscape architects, and many others served on two stakeholder groups consisting of a Project Team of about 30 members and an Advisory Group of about 100 members. All members are listed in the Acknowledgments section of the UFMP and on the website (https://www.columbusufmp.org). These groups met periodically throughout the course of the plan’s creation to provide input. The public was also engaged through an online survey, an open house, small-group presentations, and interviews. A final public comment period on the draft Urban Forestry Master Plan was held from February 16, 2021 to March 31, 2021 and public presentations were made to the Recreation and Parks Commission\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the city’s natural resources and overall environmental health, benefitting current and future generations.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,455,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of these various expenditures.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various contracts for management of the Urban Forestry Master Plan; to authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish auditor’s certificates up to the amount of $1,455,000.00 for various expenditures in conjunction with the management of the Urban Forestry Master Plan; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Davey Resource Group to continue citywide street tree inventory; to authorize the expenditure of $1,455,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
