    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND:\nIn a continued effort to improve operational efficiencies, provide better services to the public, and to streamline government organization and communication, it was determined that the Division of Code Enforcement should be relocated from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services.\n \nThis move will improve upon the existing strong coordination between the Department of Building and Zoning Services, which administers several code titles for the City of Columbus, including the Columbus Zoning Code, and the Division of Code Enforcement, which acts as the enforcement agency for the Columbus Zoning Code as well as other code titles. The code changes made by this ordinance will make the necessary adjustments to allow for the smooth and seamless transfer of this enforcement authority.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Separate legislation will address the required fiscal and human resource changes.\n \nEmergency Justification: Achieving this transfer sooner rather than later allows BZS to assimilate Code Enforcement and their processes into our current system. \n \nTitle\nTo enact, amend, and repeal various code sections in Title 2, Title 5, Title 7, Title 9, Title 13, Title 31, Title 33, Title 45, and Title 47 in order to transfer the Code Enforcement Division from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in an continued effort to improve operational efficiencies, provide better services to the public, and to streamline government organization and communication, it was determined that the Division of Code Enforcement should be relocated from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services; and\n \nWHEREAS, this move will improve upon the existing strong coordination between the Department of Building and Zoning Services, which administers several code titles for the City of Columbus, including the Columbus Zoning Code, and the Division of Code Enforcement, which acts as the enforcement agency for the Columbus Zoning Code as well as other code titles; and\n \nWHEREAS, the code changes made by this ordinance will make the necessary adjustments to allow for the smooth and seamless transfer of this enforcement authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to enact, amend, and repeal various code sections to transfer the Code Enforcement Division from the Department of Development to the Department of Building and Zoning Services, NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \n(See ORD2328-2021Attachment)",
