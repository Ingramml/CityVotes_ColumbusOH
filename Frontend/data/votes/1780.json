    "description": "Title\n \nTo proclaim September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month in the City of Columbus and to recognize and thank the Columbus Urban League Young Professionals, Beyond the Cell, the Ohio Sickle Cell and Health Association, the Faith Thomas Foundation, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, the Greater Columbus Chapter of the American Red Cross, African American Greek organizations and affected families for their advocacy and commitment to bringing awareness to Sickle Cell Disease.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the observance of National Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month originated in 1975 with month-long events to call attention to Sickle Cell Disease and the need to address the illness nationally and locally; Sickle Cell Disease is a global health problem affecting more than 100,000 people in the United States, touching people of all races and in some characterized by chronic fatigue and pain; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is estimated that in the United States, that more than 1,000 babies are born with Sickle Cell Disease each year - this is why there is a need for more education and awareness regarding this disease - while much has been done to reduce the complications,  improve the treatment and to decrease some of the symptoms for persons stricken with this disease; there continues to be a gap in the care for people with Sickle Cell Disease, moreover there is an ongoing need for innovation, treatment, research and a cure; and\n \nWHEREAS, the community partners outlined in this resolution have been providing education and support to individuals and families affected by Sickle Cell Disease on a local, state, and national level - their unwavering advocacy and awareness campaigns have helped in the fight against Sickle Cell Disease; and\n \nWHEREAS, blood transfusions remain the most common and effective treatment in the fight against Sickle Cell Disease - these organizations have steadfastly committed themselves to ensuring that Central Ohio has a solid and diverse blood supply for Sickle Cell patients through the hosting and promotion of various blood drives; and\n \nWHEREAS, these organizations remain committed to spreading awareness, increasing education and creating a platform for individuals living with or impacted by Sickle Cell Disease - this platform allows these individuals to share their stories and to use the hope and power of the community to remain inspired and encouraged  - each of these organizations have an ongoing commitment to testing, counseling, and sharing resources in a way that promotes the use of life saving treatments - this ultimately allows communities of color and others to not only give blood, but to give the gift of life in the fight against Sickle Cell Disease; now therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nThat this Council does hereby proclaim September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month in the City of Columbus and thank the Columbus Urban League Young Professionals, Beyond the Cell, the Ohio Sickle Cell and Health Association, the Faith Thomas Foundation, the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, the Greater Columbus Chapter of the American Red Cross, African American Greek organizations and affected families for their advocacy and commitment to bringing awareness to Sickle Cell Disease.",
