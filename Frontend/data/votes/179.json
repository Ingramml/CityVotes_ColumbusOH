    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, established the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program on December 27, 2020.  The Act authorized The U.S. Treasury to make payments to states and eligible units of local government, including the City of Columbus, to assist households that are unable to pay rent and utilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nWhere expenditures require City Council approval in accordance with Columbus City Code, city departments will advance said legislation for consideration by City Council.\n \nThe ERA program will provide assistance to eligible households through existing or newly created rental assistance programs.  Not less than 90 percent of awarded funds must be used for direct financial assistance, including rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and other expenses related to housing.  Remaining funds are available for housing stability services, including case management and other services intended to keep households stably housed, and administrative costs.  Funds generally expire on December 31, 2021.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management will be responsible for monitoring the distribution and appropriate expenditure of ERA funds based on guidance provided by the United States Department of Treasury.  The Department of Finance and Management is requesting these funds be appropriated to two sub-funds.  The first subfund will receive the entire awarded amount.  The second subfund will be established for any interest earnings. \n \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency consideration is requested so that funds made available to the city can begin to be used as quickly as possible.
