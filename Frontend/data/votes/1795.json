    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Technical Choice, LLC for the Raymond Memorial Golf Course Irrigation Improvements Design Project. The contract amount is $59,320.00, with a contingency of $15,000.00, for a total of $74,320.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe irrigation system involved in this project services both Raymond Memorial and Wilson Road Golf Courses. It is often referred to as the Raymond irrigation system due to the location of the pumps, motors, and controllers. This project will provide an upgrade to both golf courses.  The Raymond Memorial Golf Course was originally established in 1954.  With around 40,000 rounds annually, Raymond Memorial produces the highest number of rounds of all six of the golf courses operated by Columbus Recreation and Parks.  Wilson Road Golf Course opened in 1971 and sees close to 30,000 guests annually as well, providing a great place for new golfers to enter the sport.  \n \nOver the past few years this irrigation system has continued to decline.  The main line is the original line for both courses. Some of the lateral lines have been upgraded, however, they are all past 34 years of age. The pump station at Wilson Road is no longer in service due to the well not being viable.  This reduced the capacity of the system for both golf courses and put more strain on the existing system. As a result, the irrigation pump and motors have begun to decline over the past couple of years. Currently, improvements to the motors and pumps at holes 10 and 15 are ongoing and nearly complete but the current irrigation system is not able to provide what is needed to continue to service both golf courses.  The flow rate has dropped by 30% and the lateral lines and sprinkler heads are in terrible shape. Simply put, this irrigation system is not able to provide the water we need to keep the playing surfaces at a high standard.    \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 11, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on May 26, 2021.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nTechnical Choice, LLC (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals, conducted short list interviews, and recommended Technical Choice, LLC be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach. It is worth noting that Technical Choice provided these very same services for Champions Golf Course and produced a successful project.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTechnical Choice, LLC\n595 Lake Road, Suite C-2                                                      \nJoel Braun, 330-321-2523\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 002558, 26-4249337\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: February 5, 2022                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the design can be completed and installation can happen prior to the 2022 golf season.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract is necessary to provide acceptable golf playing surfaces to the public.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since the repairs included in this project are utilitarian in nature, community input was not directly provided.  However, staff that is responsible for the day to day operation of the Golf Course did provide input on how the repairs to the irrigation system could be performed to improve the general operation of the course for the community.\n \nArea(s) Affected: West Scioto (37)\nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving revenue producing amenities.
