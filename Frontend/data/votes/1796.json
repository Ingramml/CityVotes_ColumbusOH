    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with GPD Group for the Alkire Park Improvements - Phase 1 Design Project. The contract amount is $104,937.00, with a contingency of $12,061.00, for a total of $116,998.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nIn 2007, the Recreation and Parks Department acquired 110 acres of former farmland on the city’s east side, near the Village of Galloway. The property is located within the Big Darby environmental preservation area. It is considered a key preservation site for the watershed on the boundary of Columbus and the Big Darby. As part of the acquisition, 25 acres of land was set aside for a future neighborhood park for Columbus residents in the Laurel Greene and Southwest Airport Neighborhoods. \n \nIn 2020, OHM Advisors worked with the Recreation and Parks Department, Westland Area Commission, and the Darby Accord Advisory Group to create a master plan for Alkire Park. The master plan demonstrates a low-impact, sustainable park that provides a natural, accessible, and multi-generational recreation space to the surrounding neighborhoods. \n \nThe Alkire Park Improvements - Phase 1 Design Project will include the production of all bidding and construction documents necessary to build out phase 1 of the master plan for Alkire Park. Phase 1 includes site earthwork, demolition, utilities, parking area, drive, portable toilet screens, landscaping, a playground, site furnishings, and path connections to nearby neighborhoods and the Camp Chase Trail. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised to three pre-qualified A/E firms that were prequalified through the biannual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 3, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on May 17, 2021.  Request for proposals were sent to the following companies:\n \nGPD Group (MAJ)\nEG, Inc. (MAJ)\nThe Mannick & Smith Group, Inc. (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals, conducted short list interviews, and recommended GPD Group be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210                                                      \nJeff Evans, PE, 614-210-0751\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006560, 34-1134715                                 \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 20, 2023                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the design services can be completed in order to have final construction documents ready for bidding in January of 2022. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Alkire Road Park will be a significant greenspace for the Westland Neighborhood. The scale of park will allow for direct neighborhood connections to preserved prairie land, open space, a new playground, and connection to the Camp Chase Trail. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Westland Area Commission has been advocating for the development of Alkire Park for several years. Input has been gathered during the master planning and programming phase of Alkire Park development with Westland Area Commission, the Darby Accord Advisory Group, and Prairie Township. Those advocacy groups will also be engaged during the phase 1 design phase to gather consensus on the design elements. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Westland (52)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks, trails, and easy, all-age connectivity for Columbus residents.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $116,998.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with GPD Group for the Alkire Park Improvements - Phase 1 Project; to authorize the appropriation of $116,998.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747; to authorize the expenditure of $116,998.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
