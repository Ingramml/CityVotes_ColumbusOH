    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Procon Professional Construction Services, Inc. for the UIRF - Maloney Park Improvements Project. The contract amount is $291,303.00, with a contingency of $33,697.00, for a total of $325,000.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental fees for a total of $327,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe South Linden Area Commission requested various improvements to Maloney Park through the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) Program. The Recreation and Parks Department worked with the Area Commission and UIRF team to identify and prioritize the scope of improvements for the park. As a result, the stakeholders identified the need for the realigning and resurfacing the existing asphalt loop walking path. Improving the existing gazebo, including bringing electrical service to the gazebo for special events, was also identified. Additionally, alternates were included in the bid, providing pricing for planting additional trees, replacing existing park benches, and adding additional new park benches. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on June 9, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 22, 2021.
