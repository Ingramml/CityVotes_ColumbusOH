    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus has been awarded an FY2020 Improving Criminal Justice Responses Subgrant Award (Blueprint for Safety: An Inter-Agency Response to Domestic Violence) from the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (VAWA) and the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services via the Franklin County Board of Commissioners, Office of Justice Policy and Programs.  The VAWA program provides funding to allow states and local governments to support a broad range of activities to reduce domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by strengthening services to victims and holding offenders accountable. The total VAWA subgrant award amount to the City of Columbus is $50,907.00. The total project costs will be $50,907.00.\n \nCPD will collaborate with Franklin County Municipal Court, Department of Pretrial and Probation Services, Columbus City Attorney’s Office Domestic Violence Unit, Franklin County Sherriff’s Office and the Center for Family Safety and Healing to apply a collective impact approach to domestic violence.  They will build off local successes by linking best practice communication protocols, risk assessments and evidence collection tactics occurring at each justice phase. Through the Blueprint process, justice and victim advocacy practitioners work collaboratively to review and update current response protocols/practices and develop standard methods for proactive data sharing. This results in a single, written response policy with clearly outlined protocols for each practitioner’s role, responsibility, specific action and documentation duties.  To this end, the subgrant funds will cover city CPD overtime costs for this grant cycle.\n \nThe City must act as subgrantee to the Franklin County Office of Justice Policy and Programs.  Therefore, the Director of Public Safety is required to sign a subgrantee award on behalf of the City.  The official City program contact authorized to act in connection with the Blueprint for Safety Project is Special Victims Bureau CPD Domestic Violence Unit Sergeant Richard Ketcham.  \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is necessary to meet grant deadlines and to make the funds available at the earliest possible time.  The grant award period start date was April 1, 2021.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   There is no fiscal impact on the General Fund. The appropriated funds will be reimbursed by the grant award.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Public Safety of the City of Columbus to accept a subgrantee award through the FY2020 Improving Criminal Justice Responses Subgrant Award  program from the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women and the Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services via the Franklin County Board of Commissioners, Office of Justice Policy and Programs; to authorize Sgt.
