    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the Professional Construction Management II (PCM II) Services Agreement with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. in an amount up to $600,000.00, for the Division of Water.\n \nWork performed to date includes design phase and construction phase services for multiple capital improvement projects including: program management, constructability reviews, construction cost estimating, project coordination, construction scheduling, and construction administration (CA) and construction inspection (CI) services.  \n \nThis modification (#6) provides funding to continue construction phase services including program management, construction management, field representation/inspection, material inspection and testing, PLC programming and controls integration services, O&M ready support services, and assistance with claims negotiation.  These services will be provided through the end of each construction project included in the PCM program.  \n \nThis is the last planned modification, but another modification might be needed if construction is delayed beyond current planning horizon.\n \n2. CONTRACT DURATION / FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  This contract provides Professional Construction Management (CM) services under multiple contract modifications over a multiyear period to support multiple construction projects that begin construction within the 2017 through 2020 period, with services extending through the end of the construction durations for each assigned project.  The DRWP UV Disinfection construction project will determine the duration of the PCM services and its estimated that the PCM services will be complete by end of June 2022, but this contract duration may need to be extended based on actual construction durations. \n \nContract modification #6 (current) provides funding for construction phase services for the projects listed below:\n \n•                     690535-100000                     DRWP UV Disinfection\n•                     690553-100000                     As-Authorized Contingency\nA description of these projects can be found on the attachment “ORD 2155-2021 Information”, Item No. 9.\n \nAll projects have a \"Citywide\" planning area since they service several central Ohio communities.\n \n2.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $600,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $     618,000.00                     (PO003180, -3188, -3196, -3199, -3202, -3205, -3208)\nModification 1                     $  1,506,000.00                     (PO049895)\nModification 2                     $  5,069,000.00                     (PO098486)\nModification 3                     $  7,576,000.00                     (PO152038)                     \nModification 4                     $  3,998,000.00                     (PO207271)\nModification 5                     $  2,878,000.00                     (PO246829, PO246830, PO246831, PO246832, PO246833)\nModification 6 (current)                     $     600,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Mods)                     $22,245,000.00\n \n2.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis modification was planned and identified in the RFP and the original contracting legislation Ord. 0003-2016, which called for services to be provided by the selected PCM team over a multi-year period.\n \n2.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original RFP and the initial authorizing legislation Ord. 0003-2016 for this project anticipated that the selected PCM team would provide services over a multi-year period to maintain continuity and consistency through the project construction periods and to provide coordination between projects.  The current PCM team is familiar with the details of the multiple construction projects underway.  The process of selecting and contracting a new PCM team to oversee these construction projects would likely impact construction progress and increase construction costs.\n \n2.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe consultant prepared a cost breakdown exhibit including estimated hours and hourly rates for upcoming work.  This cost breakdown was reviewed and approved by the Project manager for the City Division of Water.  \n \n3. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis is a Professional Construction Management project which will facilitate the construction administration and construction inspection services for projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects are all related to the drinking water supply and treatment systems.  These projects are incorporated in the capital improvement program for various reasons including meeting regulatory requirements, improving the reliability of the City’s drinking water supply, and enhancing worked and public safety.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices, including recycling programs in their offices, a commitment to double sided printing, and utilization of Project Management Information System (PMIS) for submittal reviews which limits the need for printing documents for review.  \n \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  95-2661922, expires 7/22/22, Majority, DAX Vendor No: 10897.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against AECOM Technical Services, Inc.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT:  A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the Professional Construction Management II (PCM II) Services agreement with AECOM Technical Services, for the Division of Water; to authorize a transfer and an expenditure up to $600,000.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; and to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.  ($600,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No’s PO003180, PO003188, PO003196, PO003199, PO003202, PO003205, PO003208 were authorized by Ordinance No. 0003-2016, passed February 1, 2016, and authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter into contract with AECOM Technical Services, Inc., for the Division of Water’s Professional Construction Management II Services Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 1 under Purchase Order No. PO049895, authorized by Ordinance No. 3363-2016, passed January 30, 2017, was executed March 1, 2017, and approved by the City Attorney on March 3, 2017, provided funding for design phase CM services for six projects:  DRWP and HCWP Standby Power, DRWP and HCWP UV Disinfection, HCWP Hypochlorite Conversion, and PAWP Hypochlorite Conversion; and construction phase services for three projects:  DRWP and HCWP Standby Power and DRWP UV Disinfection; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 2, under Purchase Order No. PO098486, authorized by Ordinance No. 2725-2017, passed December 4, 2017, was executed January 5, 2018, and approved by the City Attorney on January 12, 2018, provided funding for design and construction phase services for the six projects listed above under Modification No. 1, plus design and construction phases services for the Alum Creek Pump Station Miscellaneous Improvements project, and design phase services for the HCWP Basin Concrete Improvements project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 3, under Purchase Order PO152038, authorized by Ordinance No. 2461-2018, passed November 19, 2018, was executed December 20, 2018, and approved by the City Attorney on January 7, 2019, provided funding for design and construction phase services for the following six projects:  DRWP and HCWP Standby Power, DRWP and HCWP UV Disinfection, Alum Creek Pump Station Miscellaneous Improvements, and As-Authorized Contingency; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 4, under Purchase Order PO207271, authorized by Ordinance No. 2801-2019, passed November 25, 2019, was executed December 25, 2019, and approved by the City Attorney on January 8, 2020, provided funding for construction phase services for the following five projects:  DRWP and HCWP Standby Power Projects, the DRWP and HCWP UV Disinfection Projects, and As-Authorized Contingency; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 5 under Purchase Orders PO246829, PO246830, PO246831, PO246832, PO246833, was executed October 21, 2020, and approved by the City Attorney on October 23, 2020, provided funding for construction phase services for the following five projects:  DRWP and HCWP Standby Power Projects, the DRWP and HCWP UV Disinfection Projects, and for As-Authorized Contingency; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 6 (current) provides funding for construction phase services for the following two projects:   DRWP UV Disinfection and for As-Authorized Contingency; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Auditor to transfer and expend funds within the Water G.O.
