    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a sanitary sewer easement described and recorded in Instrument Number 198005050010644, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”).

The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed the request by the property owner to vacate a portion of the existing easement and determined that the easement is no longer needed as the sewer was relocated and a new easement was recorded in instrument 201810190143393. DPU has determined that terminating a portion of the City’s rights to the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable. \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release and terminate a portion of the City’s easement rights described and recorded in Instrument Number 198005050010644, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
