    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew a contract with Watson’s Lawn Care LLC for an additional year for Lawn Care and Miscellaneous Maintenance services for properties held by the Division of Land Redevelopment.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $ 20,000.00                                                               PO218374\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $ 20,000.00\nTotal contract amount                                          $ 40,000.00\n \nThe purpose of the lawn care program is to provide services such as routine mowing, removal of brush and excessive high grass, and all foreign material, and similar work for properties held by the Land Reutilization Program.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014518 on Vendor Services in February 2020 for the lawn care program.  38 bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with ten bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to February 28, 2021, with an option to renew one additional year, through 2022.   Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result a delay in providing these services.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract. \n \nThis legislation will allow for payment for services from the date the original contract expired and extend the contract an additional year, ending February 28, 2022. \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in fund 2206.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 024023 and expires 3/5/2022.                     \n                     \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract with Watson’s Lawn Care LLC for an additional year to provide Lawn Care and Miscellaneous Maintenance services for properties held by the Division of Land Redevelopment in an amount up to $20,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $20,000.00 from the Land Management Fund; to authorize the payment of expenses starting February 28, 2021; and to declare an emergency.
