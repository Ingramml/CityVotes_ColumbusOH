    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a letter of intent and negotiate solar power purchase agreements for the Division of Power with DG Development & Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“DG Development”); authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into associated interconnection agreements; authorizes the Director of Finance to enter into license or lease agreements for selected Department of Public Utilities sites; and waives provisions of Columbus City Code relating to award of contracts through the RFP process.  \n \nDG Development was selected for award of these contracts through an RFP process, in which the Director of Public Utilities sent out a request for proposals to potential solar vendors for solar power purchase agreements at three Department of Public Utilities’ sites: the Parsons Avenue Water Plant, Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant, and the Sewer Maintenance Building.      \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities will enter into a letter of intent with DG Development that will include a 120 day exclusivity period in which the Department of Public Utilities will not solicit, initiate, entertain, discuss or encourage submission of any other proposal or offer for the installation of any system or the sale of solar energy at or near the Department of Public Utilities sites specified in the letter of intent and certain confidentiality provisions.  These provisions are in our customers’ best interest to provide DG the certainty needed to expend resources on interconnection and environmental studies to determine solar installation design, capacity, and power purchase price.   \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities will negotiate power purchase agreement terms and conditions with DG for Department of Public Utilities sites, DG Development will secure financing for, install, and operate solar systems at the Department of Public Utilities sites, and DG Development will sell the energy generated and environmental attributes from the solar systems to the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Power. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities seeks to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code relating to award of contracts to allow the Department to select alternative sites in lieu of one or more of the sites listed above so that the most beneficial design, capacity, and power purchase price can be selected.  This ordinance does not require the Director of Public Utilities to execute a contract with DG if the negotiation and due diligence process does not produce pricing/terms and conditions that serve the best interest of the City and its customers.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE #:  (CC033378)\nDG Development & Acquisition, LLC | Tax ID#: 84-1880021 | Vendor CC#: 033378, MAJ, expires on 8/26/2022 \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nThere is an expenditure of $1.00 associated with this ordinance to allow the Director of Public Utilities the authority to enter into the letter of intent and solar power purchase agreement for the supply of power to the Division of Power.  Ordinances will be submitted yearly to fund any planned phases of the contract.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is requested to be an emergency measure to allow negotiations and due diligence to begin at the earliest possible date.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to negotiate and enter into a letter of intent, and to negotiate and enter into solar power purchase agreements for the Division of Power;
