    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This project will install a cogeneration system at Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant. The system will use methane-rich biogas from the digesters to create about half the electricity the plant uses and will also create steam and hot water for use throughout the plant. The system will have an acceptable payback period and make significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The system is large and complex. A building will be modified to house the new CHP engine/generators installed there.  The plant-wide biogas piping system will be replaced; the steam and hot water systems will be modified; the plant electrical power system will be modified; and boilers at the end of their useful life will be removed. As part of this project the plant CMT facilities will also be improved.  This project will deliver a complete and fully operating system. \n \nPlanning Area - 99 - Citywide\n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: Contract work is required to be substantially complete in a manner acceptable to the City within 730 days from the date that a Notice To Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nPROCUREMENT INFORMATION: The Division advertised for competitive bids submission for the subject services on the City's Vendor Services website and in the City Bulletin in accordance with the overall provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code. The Division of Sewerage and Drainage received three (3) bids on August 4, 2021 from the following: \n \n\n\n\nNAME\n\nTAX ID\n\nDAX #\n\nCity/State\n\nStatus\n\nExpiration\n\n\n\nBowen Engineering\n\n35-1136995\n\n007022\n\nIndianapolis, IN\n\nMAJ\n\n9/1/2022\n\n\n\nKokosing Industrial, Inc.\n\n47-2946608\n\n012309\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nMAJ\n\n6/2/2023\n\n\n\nKenmore Construction\n\n34-0802152\n\n006456\n\nAkron, OH\n\nMAJ\n\n6/8/2022\n\n\n \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION is not requested at this time. \n \nECONOMIC / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: This project will reduce electricity consumption at the plant by about half and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 4,000 tons a year of equivalent CO2. The project provides an acceptable payback period achieved from the reduced cost of electricity.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This Ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund 6102 to the Ohio Water Development (OWDA) Loan Fund 6111 in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the OWDA Loan Fund and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in October 2021.  Additionally $2,000.00 is necessary for Prevailing Wage Services from the Department of Public Service.  The expenditure of $2,000.00 is needed from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is also necessary to align the authority.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Bowen Engineering, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant Cogeneration Facility; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $30,132,734.00 from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund to the Ohio Water Development (OWDA) Loan Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $30,132,734.00 from the Ohio Water Development (OWDA) Loan Fund; to authorize an expenditure up to $2,000.00 for prevailing wage services to the Department of Public Services within the Sanitary General Obligations Voted Bonds Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.
