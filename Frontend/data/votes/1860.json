    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend Sections 585.03 and 585.09 of the Columbus City Codes pertaining to Vehicle for Hire Board membership and voting quorum.  Currently, the code mandates a member of the board from the Smart Columbus initiative.  However, as the scope of the organization’s mission evolves, the Licensing Section and Smart Columbus mutually agreed that full board membership for the latter was not necessary going forward.  It is still the intent for Smart Columbus to work with the Vehicle for Hire Board and the Licensing Section when certain initiatives may be of mutual interest.  The code amendment will also adjust the number of board members required for a quorum accordingly.  Overall, these changes will further the City administration’s and Council’s efforts to update and streamline the Licensing Code and modernize regulations for the City’s businesses and residents.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend sections 585.03 and 585.09 of the Columbus City Codes pertaining to the membership and voting regulations of the Vehicle for Hire Board; and to repeal existing sections 585.03 and 585.09 of the Columbus City Codes.    \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Chapter 585 of the Columbus City Codes governs the city’s Vehicle for Hire Board; and \n \nWHEREAS, several updates have been made to this code over the past decade, including revisions to include new modes of transportation such as micro-transit vehicles and pedal wagons; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City is now proposing a minor update to this Code to align more closely with the missions of both the Vehicle for Hire Board and Smart Columbus by removing the board position for the Smart Columbus representative; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is still the intent for Smart Columbus to work with the Vehicle for Hire Board and the Licensing Section when certain initiatives may be of mutual interest; and\n \nWHEREAS, these changes will further the City administration’s and Council’s efforts to update and streamline the Licensing Code and modernize regulations for the City’s businesses and residents; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \n \nSECTION 1.  That sections 585.03 and 585.09 of the Columbus City Codes are hereby amended as follows:\n \n585.03 - Vehicle for Hire Board created\n \n(a) There is created a Vehicle for Hire Board consisting of sixteen (16) members, appointed by the Director of Public Safety.
