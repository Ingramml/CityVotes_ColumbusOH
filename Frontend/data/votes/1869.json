    "description": "Title\nTo celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month and recognize the contributions of the Ohio Hispanic Coalition\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Hispanic Coalition (OHCO) was founded in 1990 as a volunteer - based organization. Today it has grown into an agency offering a broad range of direct services that are culturally and linguistically - appropriate for the growing Latino/Hispanic communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Ohio Hispanic Coalition (OHCO) serves a vulnerable population, one that faces multiple barriers such as language, culture, immigration status, and a lack of access to services and programs that are culturally and linguistically - fitting for Latino/Hispanic community members; and\n \nWHEREAS, the OHCO is a private, non-profit Hispanic/Latino organization that was established in 1990 and at that time was certified as a volunteer, community-based organization in Ohio; and \n \nWHEREAS, from 1990 until 1996, OHCO voluntarily served the needs of the Hispanic/Latino population; and\n \nWHEREAS, in November 1996, the Internal Revenue Service awarded the OHCO a non-profit status under the Federal 501(c) 3 guideline; and\n \nWHEREAS, OHCO stands today as the only Latino founded, operated and 31 year old community-based organization, with full time bi-lingual employees and over 70 volunteers which offer a wide range of services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the OHCO's main services are divided by four large departments: health, youth and education, safety, and interpretation and translation services; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Coalition is committed to providing services that help transition the underserved, disadvantaged Hispanic/Latino population to safe, healthy, independent living. In an effort to accomplish these objectives OHCO believes that it must be a vital resource to the community by providing: direct services, referrals to appropriate social service agencies, necessary work skills training, linguistically and culturally appropriate health care and safety information to families and facilitating navigation of governmental and institution processes; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That we hereby celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month and recognize the contributions of the Ohio Hispanic Coalition.",
