    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to grant a temporary construction easement to the Franklin County Engineers for the reconstruction of the Agler Road Bridge over Alum Creek. The 0.117 acre temporary easement will be for 24 months and allow for construction access to perform the reconstruction.   \n \nThe Franklin County Engineers will be reconstructing the Agler Road Bridge over Alum Creek, in the city’s near Northeast Community.  The Alum Creek Trail passes underneath this bridge along the east bank, however, there is no access to the regional trail from Agler Road. For many years, the public has requested that a trail connection be built from the roadway to the trail and this County project will build an ADA accessible ramp leading from the roadway directly to the path. The County is also adding a new trail deck along the south side of the new bridge, from Sunbury Road to the Kipp School campus, providing new connectivity for the neighborhood. The project is set to begin construction in early 2022. The Alum Creek Trail will be closed only for short intermittent periods during the 18 month project duration.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nFranklin County Engineers\n970 Dublin Road\nColumbus, OH  43215\nEd Herrick, PE (614) 525-3300\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as it is immediately necessary to sign the temporary easement for the County to meet their federal right-of-way clearance deadline.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will create increased access for thousands of residents to and from the Alum Creek Trail.
