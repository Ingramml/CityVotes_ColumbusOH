    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (Mod #1) the professional engineering services agreement with Resource International for the Twin Lakes Upper Dam and Greenlawn Low Head Dam Improvements project (CIP 611038-100000), in an amount up to $501,311.12.  \n \nTo date, the consultant has conducted the required field investigations and the preliminary design reports to produce the preferred alternative for each project area. The consultants have used this data to assemble the 75% project plans and are currently working towards their 100% plan submittal for the Greenlawn Dam Location. The Twin Lakes site is currently at a 30% project plan level.\nFuture work will concentrate on completing the project construction plans, assembling the construction documents, bidding the work and conducting engineering services during construction.  \nPlanning Area is 57 (Mid East) for the Twin Lakes Upper Dam project.\nPlanning Area is 60 (Brewery District) for the Greenlawn Low Head Dam project. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:    $   501,311.12\n                     Original Contract (PO124615)                                          $    490,851.90\n                     Modification #1 (current)                                          $    501,311.12\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                          $    992,163.02\n \nReasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThis contract modification will provide the funding necessary to complete the designs of the added scope of improvements at two project sites. The project scope has been increased based on field investigation performed under the original contract.\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs, as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant.  In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.\n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by Resource International, which has been reviewed and confirmed by the Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD)/Stormwater Section. \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER: 31-0669793 / WBE/ Exp. 5/31/23 Vendor No. 4197\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time. \n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: The Twin Lakes Dams and the Greenlawn Low Head Dam are two separate locations and both have existing utility infrastructure running through them. These improvements to the two low head dams will protect the existing utility infrastructure.  Twin Lakes Upper Dam improvements could include the installation of an emergency spillway, spillway outlet improvements, lake drain valve improvements as well as additional improvements. The Greenlawn Low Head Dam requires concrete and structural repairs. Improvements will include repairs to the abutments, structures, and other concrete surfaces. These project areas are currently in the design phase and will have different construction schedules due to their separate geographic locations.\nThe initial public meetings will be held once the design is advanced. \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes a transfer of up to $486,311.12, and an expenditure of up to $501,311.12 from the Storm Sewer Bond Fund 6204, and amends the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an engineering agreement with Resource International, for professional engineering services for the Twin Lakes Upper Dam and Greenlawn Low Head Dam Improvements project for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section; to authorize a transfer within up to $486,311.12, and an expenditure in an amount up to $501,311.12 within the Storm Sewer Bond Fund, and to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.  ($501,311.12)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section wishes to modify and increase PO124615 with Resource International for the Twin Lakes Upper Dam and Greenlawn Low Head Dam Improvements project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for this Council to authorize a transfer within up to $486,311.12, and an expenditure of up to $501,311.12 from the Storm Sewer Bond Fund 6204 for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to align authority to match the expenditure; and \nWHEREAS, this Ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the City Code pertaining to contract modifications, and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the current contract for the Twin Lakes Upper Dam and Greenlawn Low Head Dam Improvements project with Resource International; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify and increase a professional engineering services agreement with Resource International, 6350 Presidential Gateway, Columbus, Ohio 43231; for the Twin Lakes Upper Dam and Greenlawn Low Head Dam Improvements project (CIP 611038-100000); for an expenditure up to $501,311.12 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Office of the Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section.\n \nSECTION 2.
