    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Toole Design Group for the Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Eastland project.\nOrdinance 2618-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Toole Design Group for the Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Eastland project.  The intent of the project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, with continuing, contractual access to additional resources that are necessary to perform professional engineering and survey services as well as provide technical expertise for the Department to implement sidewalk projects to provide improved pedestrian access to schools.  The Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Eastland project will install sidewalk along streets surrounding Independence High School and Liberty Elementary School.\n \nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the additional design elements that were not included under the original scope of services.  The elements in the modification were not known until the design was underway and additional information was made available to the design team and the City through the Preliminary Alignment. This work directly pertains to and is a part of the design already underway by the consultant therefore it is more cost effective to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $520,000.00     (PO146200, Ord. 2618-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $  90,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $610,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Toole Design Group.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Toole Design Group. is CC000315 and expires 9/15/2022.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $90,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner and prevent delays in the project schedule to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Toole Design Group in connection with the Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Eastland project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $90,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($90,000.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, contract no.
