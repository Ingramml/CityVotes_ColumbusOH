It also authorizes the Department of Public Service to expend up to $700,000.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, Fund 2265, to compensate the FCEO for the performance of said services.  \n \nIn order to maximize operating efficiencies, County and City forces occasionally service portions of the other’s roadways that lie within their respective jurisdictions.  Under this agreement, each entity is responsible for tracking the labor, equipment, and materials used in order to determine the cost for all snow plow and ice removal activities performed. The FCEO typically services more City of Columbus roadways than the City services County roadways, with the entities settling up once each year. This ordinance is to authorize: 1) the execution of a service contract between Public Service and the FCEO and 2) the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $700,000.00, which represents the estimated net amount that will be due to the FCEO for the 2021-2022 winter season.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $700,000.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, Fund 2265.
