Pursuant to this Contribution Agreement, the City shall contribute funds in the amount of $38 million to the Authority to pay for Project Costs (other than Stadium Costs).  Subject to appropriation by City Council, the City’s contribution shall be made as follows:\n \n¾                     Not later than March 1, 2020, the amount of $13,000,000 (payment authorized pursuant to Ordinance No. 0456-2020)\n¾                     Not later than March 1, 2021, the amount of $12,500,000\n¾                     Not later than March 1, 2022, the amount of $12,500,000\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to make the payment by the required date in the Contribution Agreement.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the payment of $12,500,000.00 to the Authority in connection with the City’s funding commitments under the Contribution Agreement. It is necessary to certify the requisite funds in the amount of $12,500,000 against the Special Income Tax Fund.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Special Income Tax to the Development Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $12,500,000.00, from the Development Taxable Bond Fund, to the Confluence Community Authority; and to declare an emergency.
