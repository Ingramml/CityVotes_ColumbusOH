    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Shelly & Sands, Inc. for the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 0 project in an amount up to $2,811,480.10.\nOrdinance 0764-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Shelly & Sands, Inc. for the construction of the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 0 project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.  \n \nThe work performed to date for this project consists of repairing and resurfacing 64 city streets and constructing 157 ADA curb ramps along those streets.  The work consists of milling the existing pavement, overlaying with new asphalt concrete, and replacing curb and sidewalk associated with installing ADA wheelchair ramps.  Where warranted, the plans also called for areas of full depth pavement repair.  This project also includes the removal of existing parking meter posts in designated areas and the installation of concrete foundations for the installation of parking kiosks.\n \nThe work for modification one will consist of the reconstruction of Dividend Drive from Diplomacy Drive to Equity Drive, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract.  The construction cost of this modification is $2,811,480.10 and the amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $255,590.00.  The total legislated amount for this modification is $3,067,070.10.\n \nThe original contract amount, no inspection:                               $  7,804,268.22     (PO270114, Ord. 0764-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:                              $  2,811,480.10     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                            $10,615,748.32  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Shelly & Sands, Inc.\n \n2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of reconstructing Dividend Drive.  The construction plans were ready for advertisement in 2007 but were delayed due to a lack of funding.  The street has deteriorated to the point of necessary reconstruction which was not originally anticipated.  To bid this part of the work would delay the project further and allow for additional deterioration of the road requiring additional cost for repairs.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Shelly & Sands, Inc. is CC006043 and expires 02/21/22.\n \n4.  Pre-Qualification Status\nShelly & Sands, Inc. and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $3,067,070.10 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.  \n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of modification one for the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 0 project to facilitate the completion of planned improvements in a timely manner, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Shelly & Sands, Inc. in connection with the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 0 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $3,067,070.10 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($3,067,070.10) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
