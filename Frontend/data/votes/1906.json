    "description": "Explanation                                           \n \nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus health statistics show an increase in disease associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.  To encourage healthy and active living Columbus Public Health has budgeted $20,000.00 in the Health Special Revenue Fund for making grants to non-profit organizations for community gardening projects.  City Council wishes to support this project and has made available in the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund an additional $25,000.00. \n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to appropriate $25,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund and to authorize the total expenditure of $45,000.00 from the Health Operating Fund ($20,000.00) and the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund ($25,000.00) for the payment of $45,000.00 to The Columbus Foundation, Foundation for Columbus Public Health for the management of the 2022 Community Gardening Project.  \n \nThe City’s Community Garden Initiative supports the City’s effort to build a fair and sustainable food system.  As part of the Local Food Action Plan, community gardens improve access and education for healthy, affordable, and local food. But beyond improving food access, community gardens provide the space for powerful neighborhood-level social change. Since 2010, Columbus City Council has supported 311 gardens with funding over $340,000.  In 2020, 31 gardens were supported by this grant including 1 new community garden.  In an effort to promote equitable healthy food access and social support networks, 74% of funded gardens were located in CelebrateOne priority neighborhoods in 2020.\nThe Foundation is a donor-advised fund that was established by the Columbus Board of Health with The Columbus Foundation in 2008 under the authority of Ordinance No. 1210-2008, approved by City Council on July 14, 2008.  Ordinance No. 0493-2011, approved by City Council on April 4, 2011, amended the agreement with The Columbus Foundation by authorizing The Columbus Foundation, Foundation for Active Living to accept funds from the City.  Ordinance No. 1904-2021, authorized the modification of the endowment fund name from the Foundation for Active Living to the Foundation for Columbus Public Health.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow this appropriation and the expenditure to be received by The Columbus Foundation, Foundation for Columbus Public Health as soon as possible for the development of community gardens.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: A total of $45,000.00 has been designated for this project.
