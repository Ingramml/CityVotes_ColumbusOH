    "description": "EXPLANATION\n \nBACKGROUND: The City and the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation (“ODOT”) are currently engaged in a joint project to transform the I70/71 corridor through downtown. The construction will encompass several individual projects and phases.  As a part of ODOT’s FRA-70-12.68 project (“Project”), the City previously passed Ordinance 2882-2019 authorizing the granting of several parcels for the Project. ODOT is now seeking an additional 96 month temporary easement on an approximately 0.2035 acre parcel known as parcel 6-T1 (“Real Estate”).\n \nThe City’s Department of Finance and Management and Department of Public Utilities reviewed the request and determined that the Real Estate requested by ODOT to complete the Project should, in the interest of inter-governmental cooperation, be granted at no cost. The following legislation authorizes the City’s Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute right of entries and/or temporary easements, as approved by the Columbus City Attorney, Real Estate Division, in order for ODOT to complete the Project.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Not applicable.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to not delay the benefit to the City resulting from ODOT’s Project, which will preserve the public peace, health, property, safety and welfare.\n \nTITLE\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute right of entries and/or temporary easements, approved by the City Attorney Real Estate Division, to the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, for construction of the FRA-70-12.68 project; and to declare an emergency.
