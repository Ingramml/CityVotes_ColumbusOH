    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to grant a 0.062 acre drainage easement for the Kroger Company to drain storm water into the city’s water quality treatment rain garden located at 4485 Refugee Road.\n \nIn 2020, Recreation and Parks completed a segment of the Big Walnut Trail, from Elk Run Park to Winchester Pike. As part of the project, the Department was required to provide a water quality and quantity feature for storm water runoff caused by the trail pavement. To accomplish this, the trail project built a rain garden in early 2021 behind the Kroger supermarket at 4485 Refugee Road to intercept their site’s impervious storm water runoff from the building and parking lot.  The final step of this water quality improvement is to provide the Kroger Company a drainage easement to maintain the storm pipe entering city property and out letting into the new rain garden. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nThe Kroger Company\n1014 Vine Street \nCincinnati, OH  45202\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as it is immediately necessary to provide the drainage easement to avoid delays in the construction of the storm pipe. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Big Walnut Creek is one of Central Ohio’s highest quality waterways.  By treating the runoff from over 8 acres of impervious surface, a significant environmental improvement will be provided for the stream.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Public engagement for the trail project was completed in 2019.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Southeast (65)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by protecting environmentally sensitive land and waterways. \n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to grant a drainage easement to the Kroger Company in order to drain storm water into the city’s water quality treatment rain garden located at 4485 Refugee Road; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to grant a drainage easement for the Kroger Company to drain storm water into the city’s water quality treatment rain garden located at 4485 Refugee Road; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to grant a drainage easement to avoid delays in the construction of the storm pipe, all for the preservation of public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Recreation and Parks is hereby authorized to grant a 0.062 acre drainage easement to the Kroger Company in order to drain storm water into the city’s water quality treatment rain garden located at 4485 Refugee Road.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
