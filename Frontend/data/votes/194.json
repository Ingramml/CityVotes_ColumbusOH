    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance amends Title 11, Chapter 1145 - Sewer Use Regulations, of the Columbus City Code.  \nThe proposed amendments allow the use of indoor grease interceptors in food service operations such as restaurants, cafeterias and other facilities where food is prepared without the need for a variance and standardizes the approach to how grease interceptors are sized.  Current City Code requires that grease interceptors be located outdoors except with an approved variance and does not provide design standards for sizing.  Definitions supporting the use of indoor grease interceptors have been added or modified to agree with the Ohio Administrative Code and the Ohio Plumbing Code.\nThe proposed amendments clarify that the City has authority to regulate discharges from private storm sewers as well as public storm sewers and expands the City’s authority to allow cost recovery associated with City’s response to illicit discharges that might not result in a sewer blockage.  Authority for the Director to allow polluted stormwater discharges to the sanitary sewer from defined areas within qualifying businesses is also provided.  \nFISCAL IMPACT: No fiscal impact\nTitle\n \nTo amend various sections of Title 11 Chapter 1145 of the Columbus City Code to add and expand definitions, clarify the proper handling of liquid wastes, proper discharge into the city's storm sewer system, and the assessment of damages related to illicit discharges.\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend and create various sections of Title 11, Chapter 1145 of the Columbus City Code; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Sections  1145.01, 1145.05, 1145.06, 1145.10, 1145.11, 1145.12, 1145.13, 1145.14, 1145.15, 1145.20, 1145.23, 1145.24, 1145.25, 1145.26, 1145.30, 1145.31, 1145.32, 1145.33, 1145.41, 1145.42, 1145.43, 1145.44, 1145.45, 1145.47, 1145.49, 1145.51, 1145.52, 1145.53, 1145.54, 1145.47, 1145,49, 1145.51, 1145.52, 1145.53, 1145.54, 1145.55, 1145.56, 1145.57, 1145.58, 1145.59, 1145.60, 1145.61, 1145.62, 1145.65, 1145.66, 1145.67, 1145.70, 1145.71, 1145.73, 1145.74, 1145.75, 1145.77, 1145.78, 1145.80, 1145.81, 1145.82, 1145.83, 1145.86, 1145.87, 1145.88, 1145.89, 1145.90, 1145.91, 1145.92, 1145.93, 1145.94, 1145.95, 1145.96, 1145.98, 1145.99, 1145.100, 1145.110, 1145.113 to formally define the Director of Public Utilities’ title; and  \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1145.02 to add or modify definitions supporting the use of indoor grease interceptors to agree with the Ohio Administrative Code and the Ohio Plumbing Code; and  \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1145.04 to add reference to the Ohio Plumbing Code as it pertains to separators, as necessary, for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease, sand, oil or any other materials, and the storage capacity grease interceptors; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1145.84 to clarify stormwater and surface drainage requirements and discharge to storm sewers, combined sewers, and open drainage courses; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1145.85 to clarify that all wastewater discharged must be directly into a sanitary or combined sewer, or private sewer that discharges to the public sanitary sewer system; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1145.101 to clarify the assessment of damages related to discharge that causes damage to the storm sewer system; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1145.102 to clarify that any person who causes or contributes to the illicit discharge of a pollutant into the storm sewer system is required to reimburse the city for costs incurred in responding to the illicit discharge; and  \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities to amend the various sections listed above for the public health, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That existing Sections 1145.01, 1145.05, 1145.06, 1145.10, 1145.11, 1145.12, 1145.13, 1145.14, 1145.15, 1145.20, 1145.23, 1145.24, 1145.25, 1145.26, 1145.30, 1145.31, 1145.32, 1145.33, 1145.41, 1145.42, 1145.43, 1145.44, 1145.45, 1145.47, 1145.49, 1145.51, 1145.52, 1145.53, 1145.54, 1145.47, 1145,49, 1145.51, 1145.52, 1145.53, 1145.54, 1145.55, 1145.56, 1145.57, 1145.58, 1145.59, 1145.60, 1145.61, 1145.62, 1145.65, 1145.66, 1145.67, 1145.70, 1145.71, 1145.73, 1145.74, 1145.75, 1145.77, 1145.78, 1145.83, 1145.86, 1145.87, 1145.88, 1145.89, 1145.90, 1145.91, 1145.92, 1145.93, 1145.94, 1145.95, 1145.96, 1145.98, 1145.99, 1145.100, 1145.110, 1145.113 are hereby amended as follows: \nSEE ATTACHMENT\nSECTION 2.
