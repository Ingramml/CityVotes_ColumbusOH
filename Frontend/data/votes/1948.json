    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with CTL Engineering to add additional funds for the Roadway - Materials Testing and Inspection 2020 project.\nOrdinance 0724-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with CTL Engineering for the Roadway - Materials Testing and Inspection 2020 project.  The intent of this contract is to provide the Department of Public Service with continuing, contractual access to additional resources that are necessary to provide inspection expertise and material testing for the department’s construction projects.\n \nThis is a planned modification that is a continuation of construction inspection services and materials testing for City of Columbus projects.  This contract could also be used for non-City projects for which the City is providing construction inspection services and materials testing.  This modification is necessary to allow construction to continue on projects currently being built and for construction to start on recently awarded projects.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00     (PO223531, Ord. 0724-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $500,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $1,000,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CTL Engineering.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for CTL Engineering is MBE004209 and expires 07/31/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 2241, the Private Construction Inspection Fund, and within Fund 5518, the Construction Inspection Fund.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the needed inspection and testing services to continue uninterrupted, preventing delays in the Department of Public Service’s capital improvement projects.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to modify the contract with CTL Engineering in connection with the Roadway - Materials Testing and Inspection 2020 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $150,000.00 from the Private Construction Inspection Fund and up to $350,000.00 from the Construction Inspection Fund to pay for the modification; and to declare an emergency.  ($500,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no. PO223531 with CTL Engineering, in the amount of $500,000.00, was authorized by ordinance no. 0724-2020; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary to modify the contract in an amount up to $500,000.00 and provide additional funds for the Roadway - Materials Testing and Inspection 2020 project; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding for the contract modification is available within Fund 2241, the Private Construction Inspection Fund, and within Fund 5518, the Construction Inspection Fund, to pay for the contract modification; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for the services delivered under the contract modification; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the contract with CTL Engineering to prevent delays in the project schedule,  to preserve the safety of the traveling public thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be, and hereby is, authorized to modify the professional services contract with CTL Engineering at 2860 Fisher Road, Columbus, Ohio, 43204, for the Roadway - Materials Testing and Inspection 2020 project in an amount up to $500,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, in accordance with the plans and specifications on file in the Department of Public Service, which are hereby approved.\nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $150,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 2241 (Private Construction Inspection Fund), Dept-Div 5912 (Design and Construction), in Object Class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $350,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 5518 (Construction Inspection Fund), Dept-Div 5912 (Design and Construction), in Object Class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
