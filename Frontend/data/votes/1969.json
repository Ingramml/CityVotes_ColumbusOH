    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health to support the Integrated Naloxone Access and Infrastructure Grant, called Project DAWN.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $91,000.00 in grant monies to fund the Project DAWN Expansion grant program for the period of September 30, 2021 through September 29, 2022.\n \nThe Project DAWN Expansion Grant will eliminate social and geographic barriers that might prevent individuals from acquiring Naloxone, provide overdose prevention education, and furnish Naloxone. \n \nThe increased pollution of street drugs with fentanyl has caused the illicit drugs to become more deadly, putting residents who either use drugs recreationally or who are living with a substance use disorder at extreme risk of accidental overdose death. In the 2020-2021 grant year of the Integrated Naloxone grant, in partnership with Columbus Division of Fire, CPH was able to reach 2,589 people and furnish 2,627 doses of Naloxone. The life-saving drug Naloxone has been critical in reversing the dangerous effects of an overdose and saving lives. The continuation of this grant award allows CPH to continue to provide this life-saving resource and reduce further harm. This grant seeks to serve the broader community with a priority of serving individuals that are at-risk of overdose.\nEmergency action is requested to ensure that Columbus Public Health has the sufficient amount of these supplies and services to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Columbus. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Integrated Naloxone Access and Infrastructure Grant is fully funded ($91,000.00) by the Ohio Department of Health and does not require a City match. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Department of Health for the Integrated Naloxone Access and Infrastructure Grant in the amount of $91,000.00; to authorize the appropriation of $91,000.00 to the Health Department in the Health Department’s Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($91,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS,  $91,000.00 in grant funds have been made available through the Ohio Department of Health for the Integrated Naloxone Access and Infrastructure Grant for the period of September 30, 2021 through September 29, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds from the Ohio Department of Health for the support of the Integrated Naloxone Access and Infrastructure Grant; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health to meet deliverables and to appropriate these funds to Columbus Public Health for the immediate preservation of the public health, property, safety and welfare, and to avoid a delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $91,000.00 from the Ohio Department of Health for the Integrated Naloxone Access and Infrastructure Grant for the period of September 30, 2021 through September 29, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department's Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the grant period, the sum of $91,000.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated upon receipt of an executed grant agreement to the Health Department, Division No. 5001, as indicated in the ordinance attachment.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.        \n        \nSECTION 4.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
