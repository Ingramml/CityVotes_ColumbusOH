    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Moody Nolan for the Community Creative Campus and Park Design Project. The contract amount is $1,617,230.00, with a contingency of $150,000.00, for a total of $1,767,230.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe City of Columbus is developing a new Community Creative Campus and Park in Olde Towne East. This project will provide creative programming and wellness activities for the community. Many of the popular programs from the Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis Community Senior Center will be provided at this Campus. The opportunity to offer new programs and amenities in this space is also being explored. In the fall of 2020, a contract with Pizzuti Solutions was approved by City Council to assist the Department with the planning and preliminary design stages of the Community Creative Campus and Park. There was also extensive community outreach during the spring of 2021 to help determine the programs and amenities desired by the community. This planning and preliminary engineering work is nearly complete and it is now time to begin the design in order to meet the goal of starting construction in late 2022. An extensive quality based selection process took place and the selection committee recommended a contract with Moody Nolan for professional architectural and engineering services for the Community Creative Campus. The goal is for the project to be completed during the first half of 2024.\nThis project’s mission is to support the ability of the Recreation and Parks Department to meet the needs of Columbus residents by creating facilities that are stimulating, providing support for the arts and creative community, as well as providing important park space for the Olde Towne East Community. This 4 acre site, formerly the Douglas School property, was purchased in 2020. With the procurement of this property, we acquired a unique opportunity to develop an innovative Community Creative Campus and Park that will offer expanded and efficient space for new programs, services, and recreational opportunities for the surrounding community. This space will also support the programming that took place at the former Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis Center.\nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on March 26, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on April 16, 2021.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nAbbot Studios architects + planners + designers, LLC (MAJ)\nBBCO Design LLC (MBE)\nDesign Group (MAJ)\nJKURTZ Architects (MAJ)\nLegat Architects, Inc. (MAJ)\nMeyers + Associates Architecture (MAJ)\nMSA Design (MAJ)\nMoody Nolan (MBE)\nPrime AE (MBE)\nSchooley Caldwell (MAJ)\nTriad Architects (MAJ)\nWSA (MAJ)                     \n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended Moody Nolan be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMoody Nolan\n300 Spruce Street, Suite 300                                              \nJonathan Moody, jmoody@moodynolan.com <mailto:jmoody@moodynolan.com>, 614-461-4664                                         \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004920, 31-1256984\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 12, 2022                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as this new facility is intended to serve the senior creative programs formally housed at the Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis buildings. Several of these programs have been re-housed at Thompson Community Center and the Center of Performing Arts. As a result, there are programs that no longer have a space to serve our residents.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: The Community Creative Campus and Park will offer extensive programming opportunities for the community and will also be a significant greenspace for the Old Towne East Neighborhood. This new building will also be used to house programming that no longer has space at the former Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis sites.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: A website has been created to keep the public informed of the project’s progress (www.cbuscreativecampus.com <http://www.cbuscreativecampus.com>). A survey and targeted community outreach meetings have taken place. City staff visited Olde Towne East Neighborhood Association and Near East Commission meetings and also held public meetings to discuss initial findings of the Survey results. Hard copies of the survey were distributed and picked up in places of public gatherings. Components of the project website, including the survey, were available in the Somali and Spanish languages.  All of this public feedback will shape what programs and amenities will be included within the building and on the surrounding greenspace.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Near East (56)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by addressing the need to provide space for programs that are both senior and arts focused. \n \nFiscal Impact: $1,767,230.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702, Permanent Improvement Fund 7747, and Special Purpose Fund 2223, Subfund 222356 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Moody Nolan for the Community Creative Campus and Park Design Project; to authorize the appropriation of $1,150,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund 2223, Subfund 222356; to authorize the transfer of $95,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $1,767,230.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, Permanent Improvement Fund, and Special Purpose Fund; and to declare an emergency.
