    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) for the 2021 Clean Ohio Conservation Fund (Round 15) - Refugee Road, Mason Run Preservation Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of grant and matching funds. The grant amount is $1,008,000.00 and the local match amount is $432,000.00. There is a total of $1,440,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nIn February of 2021, the Department applied for Clean Ohio Conservation Funds towards fee simple acquisition of three sites in Columbus, including one along Big Walnut Creek in the Northeast area of the city and two along Mason Run, in the city’s Mideast Community. In May of 2021, the Department received notice that the grant was approved. This particular grant involves the site along Mason Run.  \nMason Run is a primary tributary stream of Big Walnut Creek. It goes from John Glenn Regional Airport to Winchester Pike at Three Creeks Park.  This project would protect a substantial tract of 78.6 acres of land on the city’s southeast side, between Refugee Road and Kimberly Parkway.  The site contains approximately 56 acres of woodlands and nearly 21 acres of open meadow and floodplain. Five existing access points surround the perimeter of the property.  The span of the site, from Kimberly Parkway to Refugee Road, is over a half of a mile long, placing almost 5,000 residents within a 10 minute walk. In 2007, the Department acquired an adjacent 21 acre conservation property along Mason Run, and, in 2009, acquired a 24 acre natural area at the confluence of Mason Run and Big Walnut Creek. This all brings the total impact of connected stream corridor protection to nearly 1.25 miles. \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\nClean Ohio Conservation Fund, District 3\n65 East State Street, Suite 312\nColumbus, OH 43215\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the Department has signed a purchase contract for the Refugee Road property and the funds need to be available to acquire the property.\nBenefits to the Public: This project will help protect the city’s high quality waterways, greenway corridors, ravines, and urban forests. These sites are within rapidly urbanizing areas of the city and preservation of key natural sites is one of the main missions of the Recreation and Parks Department. Conservation of these sites relies heavily upon outside funding assistance to achieve these benefits.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During the past decade, residents in these communities, and the city at large, have expressed a strong priority for more protected stream corridors, headwater tributaries, access to nature, walking paths, and urban forest conservation.\nArea(s) Affected:  Mid East (57)\nMaster Plan Relation:  This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by protecting the environmental health and resilience of the city’s waterways. It will provide long term protection corridors for walking, biking, and outdoor experiences. Improved and equitable access to trails and greenways will also be achieved. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $1,008,000.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. This ordinance will also authorize a grant match of $432,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. $432,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this grant match. There is a total of $1,440,000.00 available for this project. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once the acquisitions are ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Public Works Commission for the Refugee Road, Mason Run Preservation Project; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to accept a grant in the amount of $1,008,000.00 with a minimum local match of $432,000.00; to authorize the appropriation of $1,008,000.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283; to authorize the transfer of $432,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget Ordinance; and to declare an emergency.
