    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nIn 2018, the City of Columbus instituted mandatory direct deposit for its employees.  At the same time, in order to offer an alternative to employees who were unwilling or unable to provide banking information, the Columbus City Treasurer’s Office entered into contract for two years with US Bank for payroll cards at no cost to the City.  In 2020, the City Treasurer’s Office entered into a second contract with US Bank for payroll cards for its employees, again, at no cost to the City.\n \nWith passage of ordinance number 1821-2021 on July 12, 2021, Columbus City Council authorized the City Treasurer's Office to modify its contract with US Bank to provide gift cards for Columbus Public Health for it to offer gift cards as an incentive for those that receive a vaccine at a CPH COVID-19 vaccination site.\n \nDue to the strength of community adoption, Columbus Public Health extended its incentive program for six additional weeks with additional resources provided by American Rescue Plan funding.  Columbus Public Health requested and Mayor Andrew J. Ginther provided authorization in an Emergency Letter dated August 10, 2021.  Columbus City Council authorized another modification of the City Treasurer’s Office contract with US Bank to provide additional gift cards for Columbus Public Health with passage of ordinance 2188-2021 on September 13, 2021.\n \nThe Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, has a project in collaboration with the Division of Fire for community event scheduled for October 23, 2021, and plans to compensate individuals who voluntarily surrender firearms with a gift card.  Division of Police Chief Bryant has authorized the usage of the Contraband Seizure Funds for this project.\n \nThe Treasurer’s Office now wishes to modify its contract with US Bank in order to facilitate the use of gift cards for this purpose.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that the gift cards may be obtained in time for the community event scheduled for Saturday, October 23, 2021.\n \nContract Compliance:  US Bank National Association 310841368 expiration January 30, 2022. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to modify its contract with US Bank, NA for gift cards for the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, for its gun buy-back project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $5,000.00 from fund 2219; and to declare an emergency. ($5,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, has a project in collaboration with a community event with the Division of Fire scheduled for October 23, 2021, to compensate individuals who voluntarily surrender firearms with a gift card.; and\nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer’s Office has a contract with US Bank for payroll cards; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer now wishes to modify its contract with US Bank and authorize the related expenditures to provide gift cards for the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police for its gun buy-back program; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Treasurer to modify its contract with US Bank and to authorize the expenditure as cited below, so that the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police may obtain gift cards for its gun buy-back event scheduled for Saturday, October 23, 2021, and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Treasurer is hereby authorized to modify its contract with US Bank for the period September 10, 2020 through September 9, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2.
