    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People (CD4AP) in support of the South End Café project.\n \nCD4AP is in the process of launching a social enterprise called the South End Café. The Café is designed to provide good paying jobs to those who are having a hard time finding employment, such as returning citizens and those who have been out of the workforce for an extended period of time. Positions in the Café will be offered to people without prior experience, and employees will gain a work history and practical training in both soft and hard job skills that they will leverage into future employment opportunities. CD4AP will create relationships with South Side employers with the goal that they will recruit from staff for any full-time employment opportunities.\n \nThe Café will also offer affordable, healthy meals in a neighborhood where access to healthy food is limited. As the area around the Café continues to develop, it is important to have places that are affordable and accessible for people with low income. In addition, the Café will provide a place for community members to gather for meetings, activities and socialization. So called “third places,” where people come together to build relationships, are critical in achieving community transformation, and CD4AP has made the creation of such places a priority in their work. The Café will begin construction in August, 2021 and is expected to open in February, 2022.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in providing CD4AP with the resources necessary to complete the construction and opening of the South End Café. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People in support of the South End Café project; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($75,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Community Development for All People is in the process of launching a social enterprise called the South End Café; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Café will provide good paying jobs to residents who may otherwise struggle to attain gainful employment, such as returning citizens; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Café will likewise offer affordable, healthy meals to residents of a neighborhood that currently lacks or has limited access to healthy food options; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize a grant agreement with CD4AP to avoid any delay in providing CD4AP with the resources necessary to complete the construction and opening of the South End Café, for the preservation of the public health, welfare, and safety; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People in support of the South End Café project.\n \nSECTION 2.

That with regard to the action authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $75,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
