    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA), a Grant Agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc., dba Homeport, and allow for expenses prior to the purchase order date for the Mulby Place apartment project.\n \nThe HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and current and future availability of funds.  The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing $6,050,000.00 of bond funds over two years, $2,725,000.00 from the 2020 Capital Budget and $3,325,000.00 from the 2021 Capital Budget.  This legislation would authorize the Director of Development to first execute the HDA and then a Grant Agreement in the amount $2,725,000.00 funded from the 2020 Capital Budget.  Pending the availability of funding in the 2021 Capital Budget, the department will seek City Council’s approval for a planned agreement modification.\n \nMulby Place will be located on the east side of Cleveland Avenue between Myrtle Avenue and Briarwood Avenue and will be in the nucleus of a new “downtown” part of the Linden neighborhood.  Redeveloping this city block will create a ripple effect that will spur further revitalization in an area ripe for renewal. \n \nMulby Place will provide 100 units with a mix of (70) one- and (30) two-bedroom units. Additional single-family and commercial developments are planned for nearby land.\n \nMulby Place will be a mix of two and three story buildings that will include one and two bed-room senior apartments with community spaces, retail, and outdoor areas. Designed to integrate into the Linden neighborhood and link the new proposed Linden recreation center, this redevelopment will help foster a community intergenerational lifestyle that intertwines housing, recreational, social activities and commerce opportunities for all ages. \n \nThe architectural design utilizes a traditional brick façade that pays homage to Linden’s classic working class history, detailed in a modern way to reflect the area’s urban renewal. Two buildings positioned along Cleveland and Linden Avenues will establish a walkable street front while also creating secure parking and patio spaces within the core. An outdoor recreational garden lines the eastern edge of Linden Ave to create a “community green” for residents to gather for health and wellness activities as well as space for art, music and other events. \n \nBuilding A, a three-story apartment building positioned along Cleveland Avenue, has a retail space at the northwest corner. Working in conjunction with the existing retail and restaurant at this intersection will help support current business and foster economic growth along Myrtle Avenue. The apartments at the center of this building are pushed back to allow for the creation of private residential courtyards that create communal, energetic, and organic gathering areas at the streetscape. \n \nBuilding B, along Linden Avenue, is a smaller three-story building with an intimate feel. Tuck-under and head-in parking provides a feeling of convenience and community. The façade of this building has more undulation and a variety of detail in shape and flow to create more a residential scale and character with view of the greenway east of Linden. \n \n10 units in the multi-family will be fully accessible and designed to ADA Type A standards. Homeport will also be incorporating Universal Design strategies throughout that are reasonable and cost-efficient. In addition, the project will be constructed according to either LEED or Enterprise Green Communities green building standards, ensuring that apartment units are energy efficient and sustainable for generations.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in 2020 Capital Improvement Budget. An amendment to the 2020 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004842 and expires 5/1/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement and a Grant Agreement in an amount up to $2,725,000.00 with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc., dba Homeport and allow for expenses prior to the purchase order date for the Mulby Place apartment project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,725,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
