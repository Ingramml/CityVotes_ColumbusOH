    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contracts with DaNite Sign Company and Laird Plastics for the Main Park Sign Replacement Project. The DaNite Sign Company contract amount is $48,000.00 and the Laird Plastics contract amount is $30,037.12, for a total of $78,037.12 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department has over 400 sites, including parks and facilities combined, and most of these locations have main park entry signs greeting residents into the parks and facilities. Main park entry signs serve an important role in strengthening the identity of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD) and in helping residents locate parks and facilities. The Operations and Maintenance Section of the Department has identified 32 signs that are in critical need of replacement due to various types of damage and/or expired service life. Additionally, a majority of existing main park signs do not include an identifiable address, presenting an issue for emergency situations. The purpose of this project is to procure raw sign material from Laird Plastics and to enter into contract with DaNite Sign Company for services to replace damaged and worn signs. All new signs replaced will include park and facility addresses. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nSign Replacement Services:\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on April 23, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 22, 2021. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. The base bid information shown below was a bid price based off sample work solely used to determine the lowest bid for this project. Each vendor completed a unit cost spreadsheet to be used to fulfill task orders for sign replacement once the contract has been issued. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nDaNite Sign Company (MAJ): $7,695.00\nCustom Sign & Design (MAJ): $9,650.00\nMP Dory (MAJ): $17,950.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that DaNite Sign Company was the lowest and most responsive bidder. DaNite Sign Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nRaw Sign Material:\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329 via RFQ019239, on July 15, 2021 and received by the Finance and Management Department on July 28, 2021. \n \nLaird Plastics Inc. (MAJ): $30,037.12\nCustom Sign & Design (MAJ): $44,992.00\nTarazi LLC (MAJ): $82,432.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Laird Plastics was the lowest and most responsive bidder that did meet specifications. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDaNite Sign Company\n1640 Harmon Ave, Columbus, OH, 43223                                                      \n614-444-333 Ext.: 216                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 002078, 26-0309868\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 1, 2023\n \nLaird Plastics\n2220 International Street, Columbus, OH 43228        \nJordyn Kadoves-Johnsen 614-272-0777   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 032660, 11-2578749\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: Pending\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the service provider may complete sign replacements before winter of 2021.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Main park entry signs serve an important role in strengthening the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s identity and in helping residents locate parks and facilities. Main park signs are often the first amenity that residents see when entering a park and set the tone for the experience the resident can expect. Main park signs that are warped, faded, and/or damaged do not set the best tone for a park user’s experience. Replacing critically damaged signs with new signs containing the location’s address will also enhance park user’s ability to communicate that information with other residents and/or emergency service providers. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community members have shared main park sign concerns and replacement requests through 311 calls and through other forms of communication. The Operations and Maintenance Section has also visually inspected all main park signs and have prioritized the top 32 signs that are in most need of replacement.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by removing access and circulation barriers to city parks by improving main park sign design to include addresses. It also improve overall maintenance, safety, and design standards. \n \nFiscal Impact: $78,037.12 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contracts with DaNite Sign Company and Laird Plastics for the Main Park Sign Replacement Project; to authorize the transfer of $78,037.12 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $78,037.12 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
