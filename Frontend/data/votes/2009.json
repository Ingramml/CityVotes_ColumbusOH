    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify and amend the existing contract for the CoGo Bike Share system with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC and to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU’s) with other entities in order to accept funds from those entities to contribute to the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System.\n \nSince 2019, Motivate International, Inc., a division of Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC, has managed the CoGo Bike Share system. Motivate has recently merged with and into its existing parent company, Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. This ordinance will allow the City to modify the existing Bike Share Agreement with Lyft Bike Share and Scooters, LLC to assist in the acquisition, installation, and management of a bike sharing service for the City. The amended Agreement will be directly between the City of Columbus and Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC.\n \nCurrently, the CoGo system has over 600 bikes and 88 stations throughout the city, averaging over 50,000 rides per year. The CoGo Bike Share system is popular with system members, tourists, residents, special event attendees, downtown employees, and students as it offers an alternative transit option in Columbus. The bike share system offers a unique low cost way to complete short trips without the use of a car. The health benefits of active transportation are well recognized as well. The system is also expanding into neighborhoods where access to a bike can offer an important transportation option. Lyft will provide the City of Columbus with 5,000 annual memberships per year as part of this Amended Agreement. \n \nIt has been determined that it is necessary to assist in the funding of further improvements and management of the bike sharing program. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the system has experienced a negative economic impact to its business operations. Other entities, such as the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), have also realized the importance of the bike sharing program. The City has been in discussions with those entities to join in sharing program costs. This ordinance will authorize the Director to enter into Memorandum of Understandings with such other entities in order to receive funding from them. Any such funds will be deposited into Recreation and Park’s CoGo Bike Share Property Management Subfund solely for expenses related to the bike share System. The City and Lyft also agree to partner in securing a long-term sponsor to fund the program. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nLyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC \n185 Berry Street, Suite 5000, San Francisco, California 94107\nMiller Nuttle, mnuttle@lyft.com\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 002898, 27-1439188\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: October 30, 2021\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the Amended Agreement can be executed immediately in order to continue sustainable operation of the bike share system. Also, emergency action is requested to allow for immediate execution of requisite agreements necessary to accept funds from entities who commit to contribute to the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The bike share system improves access to trails, greenway corridors, parks, jobs, events, and attractions throughout the City while improving the environmental health of the City.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: -------CoGo Bike Share continues to be a highly recognized and well-used system of bikes available for use by the general public. The community has expressed support for expanding access while continuing to keep the ride costs affordable for all and maintaining high quality customer service for users. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by removing access and circulation barriers to city parks, destinations, and trails. \n \nFiscal Impact: The Amended Agreement will require a payment of $65.00 per bike dock per month and this ordinance authorizes the Recreation and Parks Department to make monthly payments to Lyft of $65.00 per bike dock. This ordinance will provide $300,000.00 in funding to make these payments for multiple months while funding agreements are pursued and finalized. $300,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recovery Fund 2209 to meet the financial obligations of these payments. The City Auditor established the CoGo Bike Share Property Management Fund 2294, Subfund 229405, as authorized by Ordinance No.: 2037-2013. Any future deposits that the City may receive, that are intended to support the bike share system, are hereby deemed to be appropriated to this subfund. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify the existing contract for the CoGo Bike Share system with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU’s) with other entities in order to accept funds from those entities to contribute to the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System; to authorize the expenditure of $300,000.00 from the Recovery Fund 2209; and to declare an emergency.
