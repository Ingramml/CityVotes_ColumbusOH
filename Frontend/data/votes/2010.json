    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into two grant agreements with the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) for the 2021 Clean Ohio Conservation Fund (Round 15) - Cherrybottom Park Expansion Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of grant and matching funds. The total grant amount is $659,520.00, and the total local match amount is $256,480.00. There is a total of $916,000.00 in grant and matching funds being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nOrdinance No. 0330-2021 authorized the Director of Recreation and Parks to apply for funding through the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Trails Fund. In February of 2021, the Department applied for Clean Ohio Conservation Funds towards fee simple acquisition of three sites in Columbus, including one along Big Walnut Creek in the Northeast area of the city and two along Mason Run, in the city’s Mideast Community. In May of 2021, the Department received notice that the grants were approved. This ordinance involves two grants that involve the expansion of Cherrybottom Park. The sites involved are Capitol City Baptist and the Venice Club.\nBig Walnut Creek is considered one of the highest quality major waterways in Central Ohio. For several years, acquiring and preserving valuable riparian corridor along the north segment of the river has been a focus of the Recreation and Parks Department. This project will acquire two adjacent properties which would add 7.3 acres to Cherrybottom Park, a significant 90 acre parkland between Morse Road and State Route 161.  The first site, known as Capitol City Baptist, is a 3.25 acre tract of natural land along the top of a ridge overlooking Big Walnut Creek. The second site, known as the Venice Club, is a 4.1 acre tract of land directly along Big Walnut Creek, including 450 feet of stream frontage, 750 feet of forested cliff side, and two high quality wetland areas.  Acquiring these sites provides substantial long term preservation for water quality, forest preservation, protection of habitat, and future new public access for the neighborhoods along Sunbury Road.  \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\nClean Ohio Conservation Fund, District 3\n65 East State Street, Suite 312\nColumbus, OH 43215\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the Department is in negotiations for the sites and the funds need to be available to acquire the property.\n     \nBenefits to the Public: This project will help protect the city’s high quality waterways, greenway corridors, ravines, and urban forests. These sites are within rapidly urbanizing areas of the city and preservation of key natural sites is one of the main missions of the Recreation and Parks Department. Conservation of these sites relies heavily upon outside funding assistance to achieve these benefits.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During the past decade, residents in these communities, and the city at large, have expressed a strong priority for more protected stream corridors, headwater tributaries, access to nature, walking paths, and urban forest conservation.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Rocky Fork-Blacklick (33)\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by protecting the environmental health and resilience of the city’s waterways. It will provide long term protection corridors for walking, biking, and outdoor experiences. Improved and equitable access to trails and greenways will also be achieved. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $659,520.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. $195,840.00 of this grant total is for the Capitol City Baptist site and $463,680.00 is for the Venice Club Site. This ordinance will also authorize grant match funding in the amount of $256,480.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. $76,160.00 of this grant match total is for the Capitol City Baptist site and $180,320.00 is for the Venice Club Site. $256,480.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of these grant matches. There is a total of $916,000.00 available for these projects. $272,000.00 is the total available for the Capitol City Baptist site and $644,000.00 is the total available for the Venice Club Site. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once the acquisitions are ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into two grant agreements with the Ohio Public Works Commission for the Cherrybottom Park Expansion Project; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to accept two grants in the amount of $659,520.00 with a minimum local match of $256,480.00; to authorize the appropriation of $659,520.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283; to authorize the transfer of $272,804.64 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget Ordinance; and to declare an emergency.
