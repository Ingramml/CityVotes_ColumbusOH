Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nContract Modification No. 3 (current) is the result of additional engineering services during construction such as time spent responding to RFIs, attending meetings, facilitating alternative solutions, etc. due to the nature of the existing unsuitable soils and existing utilities conflicts encountered on site.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis work is integrated with the ongoing design of Phase I improvements to the public utilities complex and involves unique knowledge of the project which an additional design consultant would not possess.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nCost proposals were provided by E.P. Ferris & Associates, Inc., reviewed by the Division of Water, and were deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe goal of this project is to improve the conditions of the exterior site for the Dana G. ‘Buck’ Rinehart Public Utilities Complex.  These improvements will provide for a safer and more efficient work environment for the employees of and visitors to the complex.  If the current issues with the facility's site are not resolved, further deterioration of the pavement will occur and drainage issues will worsen, which can lead to increased safety concerns.\n \n3.
