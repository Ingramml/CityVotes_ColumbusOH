    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a modification of the Annexation Agreement entered into between the city and Perry Township on August 19, 2020, which was authorized by ordinance 0332-2020 passed July 20, 2020 (the “Agreement”).  The Agreement provides clarity regarding future growth areas for both jurisdictions by identifying Perry Township territory eligible for centralized water and sewer service and resolving issues caused by “overlapping parcels” that lie within both Perry Township and Columbus.  The Agreement resolves overlapping parcels through a combination of detachment and boundary conformance.  Pursuant to a request from Perry Township, the Department of Public Utilities has determined that it is necessary to modify the Agreement to include an additional parcel (590-184730) as eligible for detachment.  The additional parcel is directly adjacent to a parcel designated by the Agreement as eligible to detach and has no direct road frontage.  The adjacent parcels are currently under common ownership.  This modification will prevent a situation in which one parcel is eligible to detach while an adjacent landlocked parcel is not.  In addition, this legislation authorizes the modification of Exhibit A of the Agreement to correctly identify 2845 Snouffer (610-249599) and 2855 Snouffer (610-251315) as exclusively within Columbus and not within Perry Township.  \n \n \n2.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: No\n \n                     \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT: There is no fiscal impact related to the modification. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a modification of the Annexation Agreement entered into between the city and Perry Township on August 19, 2020 in order to include an additional parcel as eligible for detachment from the city to Perry Township and to correctly identify 2845 Snouffer (610-249599) and 2855 Snouffer (610-251315) as exclusively within Columbus and not within Perry Township. ($0.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the city and Perry Township entered into an Annexation Agreement on August 19, 2020 as authorized by ordinance 0322-2020 passed July 20, 2020 (the “Agreement”); and\n \nWHEREAS, the Agreement designates certain parcels lying within both the city and Perry Township that may detach from the city in accordance with the terms of the Agreement; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the Agreement to add the property identified as parcel 590-184730 as a property eligible for detachment, in the event that the property owner elects to detach, in order to prevent a situation in which one parcel is eligible to detach while an adjacent landlocked parcel is not; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is further necessary to modify Exhibit A of the Agreement to correctly identify 2845 Snouffer (610-249599) and 2855 Snouffer (610-251315) as exclusively within Columbus and not within Perry Township; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the city to modify the Agreement to include parcel 590-184730 as a property eligible for detachment and to correctly identify 2845 Snouffer (610-249599) and 2855 Snouffer (610-251315) as exclusively within Columbus and not within Perry Township; now therefore: \n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Utilities is authorized to enter into a modification of the Annexation Agreement between the city and Perry Township entered into on August 19, 2020 in order to add the property identified as parcel 590-184730 as a property eligible for detachment in the event that the owner of this parcel elects to detach and to modify Exhibit A of the Agreement to correctly identify 2845 Snouffer (610-249599) and 2855 Snouffer (610-251315) as exclusively within Columbus and not within Perry Township.   \nSECTION 2.   That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
