    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into a non-profit service contract with Think Make Live Youth for a case worker dedicated to the Unleashing Potential (“UP”) court program.  \nThe UP program will provide transformative justice for at potential emerging adults who have come into contact with our justice system and are at risk for continued criminal behavior due to lack of resources and a support system. Emerging adults, defined as individuals transitioning from childhood to adulthood between the ages of 18 and 25, are in an age category where cognitive skills and emotional intelligence continues to develop. While emerging adults make up ten percent of the U.S. population, in Ohio, emerging adults represented 18% of total arrests in 2016. Nationwide, emerging adults represent 29% of arrests. Individuals in this age bracket can naturally age out of criminal activities as their cognitive skills develop when they are provided the support and opportunities necessary to become independent, productive members of their communities.\nThe Court was awarded funding from the Mayor’s Violence Reduction Initiative to pay for these cost (Ord. 2064-2021).\n \nThe funding provides $73,100.00 for a case worker to provide support to the program participants and develop a plan to assist with navigating public assistance programs, identification and transportation needs, treatment providers, housing specialists, career and education counselors and community mentors.  These services cannot be provided by current employees of the Court at this time.\n \nThink Make Live Youth is a Non-Profit organization.
