    "description": "Explanation\n1.                     BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance enacts, amends, and repeals Columbus City Codes to provide for changes in Title 21 - Traffic Code and includes general code changes and edits so that traffic code language is consistent with other code sections and terminology used in city codes is clarified.    \n \nThis ordinance repeals the Abandoned Junk Motor Vehicle section, amends various sections, including section 2101.56 Junk Motor Vehicle section to the Inoperable vehicle section to reduce confusion regarding inoperable vehicles, and adds sections defining Collector’s vehicle and Historical vehicle.  This ordinance will modernize code sections that manage the enforcement of inoperable vehicles on private property and public streets, easements, public right-of-way or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking.  The goal of the code changes is to update various codes and more clearly define and clarify the definition of an inoperable vehicle and reduce the fine amount so that the fines are in line with other parking related infractions, thereby reducing the potential for inequities. Other sections of Traffic code will also be updated to reflect changes related to Ohio Revised Code.\n \nThe code changes and new parking infraction fines are to be effective as 30-day legislation.\n \n2.                     FISCAL IMPACT \nNo immediate fiscal impact to the City.\n \nTitle\nTo enact, amend, and repeal various sections of Title 21, Traffic Code, of the Columbus City Codes to modernize several city code sections and fine amounts.  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a goal of the City of Columbus is to modernize the parking code to clarify parking regulations; and\n \nWHEREAS, more clearly defined code definitions and violations related to inoperable and historical vehicles are needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, providing enforcement with adequate information to respond to 311 complaints is needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, various changes in the Ohio Revised Code have necessitated updates to the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to enact the following sections of the Columbus City Codes: 2101.062, 2101.165; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the following sections of the Columbus City Codes: 2101.56, 2101.166, 2105.15, 2107.01, 2137.01, 2150.02, 2150.03(B), 2150.05, 2150.06, 2150.08, 2150.10, 2151.09, 2151.18, 2151.20, 2151.21, 2151.22, 2155.05, 2155.055, 2155.07, 2155.08; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to repeal the following sections of the Columbus City Codes: 2101.55, 2151.23, 2151.24, 2155.06; NOW, THEREFORE.\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
