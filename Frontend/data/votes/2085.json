    "description": "Title\n \nTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Affordable Housing Trust\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County (AHT), established in 2001 by then Mayor Michael B. Coleman, is an independent, non-profit lender that works with the private, non-profit, and public sectors to develop affordable housing opportunities within the City of Columbus and Franklin County; and\n \nWHEREAS, according to the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio, over 50,000 families pay more than half of their income for housing, resulting in a severe affordability gap that is on track to increase; and\n \nWHEREAS, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, affordable housing is out of reach of the average renter in the City of Columbus who does not earn enough to afford a 2-bedroom home; and\n \nWHEREAS, in January 2020, AHT along with area business and non-profit investors created the Housing Action Fund (HAF) which is a $100 million revolving loan fund offering below market loans to develop affordable housing; and                  \n  \nWHEREAS, AHT and the HAF have provided over $250 million in funding to create or preserve over 13,000 units of affordable housing in Columbus and Franklin County; and\n \nWHEREAS, AHT is the manager of the Greater Columbus Community Development Collaborative (GCCDC), established in 1992; and\n \nWHEREAS, the GCCDC provides grants to Community Development Corporations (CDCs) to assist in their efforts to transform Columbus’ distressed neighborhoods into vibrant and sustainable communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, for 20 years, the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County has served as a catalyst for the production and rehabilitation of affordable homes while encouraging homeownership and strengthening neighborhoods; now, therefore;\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Affordable Housing Trust.",
