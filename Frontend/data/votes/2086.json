    "description": "Title\nTo commend and thank Ms. Teresa Featherstone for her outstanding service to the City of Columbus.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 1981 Ms. Teresa Featherstone began her long and fulfilling service to the City of Columbus in the Recreation and Parks Department; and\n \nWHEREAS, over the years, Ms. Featherstone served in a variety of positions at recreation centers including Fair Avenue School, Franklin Park, Blackburn, Dodge, Beatty, Northeast (Howard), Brentnell, Brittany Hills, Joan Park, and Marion Franklin, culminating as the Manager of the Barnett Community Center for the past 27 years; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ms. Featherstone grew up a “recreation kid” at Blackburn Community Center participating as a youth and working with the CETA Summer Teen Program. Her positive early experiences at Blackburn made it easy for Teresa to pursue a career in Recreation; and\n \nWHEREAS, for the past year and a half, Ms. Featherstone led through a challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning how to serve the community in new and innovative ways, she continued to lead with grace including handing out 200 hot Thanksgiving meals to families in need in a drive-thru style distribution in November of 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ms. Featherstone is a fierce advocate for the Recreation and Parks Department and believes that recreation changes lives. In her own life, Teresa served on various committees, worked with countless young community members providing programs, classes and special events, and received special recognition with the Hershey Youth Track Program on the national level; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus will dearly miss Ms. Featherstone and is thankful that she has left the Barnett Community Center in good standing to continue serving our community. Her love of working with families and children made her a wonderful leader on the East side; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council wishes Ms. Teresa Featherstone a happy retirement filled with new adventures, family and friends, and well-deserved time to enjoy her love of the arts; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That Columbus City Council does hereby recognize the long career and outstanding service of Ms. Teresa Featherstone to the City of Columbus\n \n]",
