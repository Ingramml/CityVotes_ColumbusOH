    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize and Honor the life of Greg Bauer, and expresses our sincere condolences to his family and loved ones \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Firefighter Greg Bauer passed on Monday, October 18, 2021 at the age of 56 after a hard fought battle with the COVID-19 virus; and\n \nWHEREAS, Firefighter Bauer joined the Columbus Division of Fire in 1996 and was assigned to Fire Station 21, known as the Blackjack Station by the Division, where he spent the majority of his career; and\n \nWHEREAS, Firefighter Bauer was the senior member at his fire house and sometimes respectfully referred to as \"the mayor\" for his keeping the troops in line. He had no issue having a talk to anyone that wasn't holding up their share but was also a mentor the young firefighters on all three shifts; and                      \n  \nWHEREAS, Firefighter Bauer was truly the very definition of pride and ownership within the fire service. He was the primary driver of Engine 21 on Unit 3 and was dedicated to protecting and maintaining his equipment; and                      \n \nWHERAS, Firefighter Bauer had an infectious smile and laugh. You would often find him supporting his fellow firefighter with words of encouragement or a big hug. He will be missed greatly by all who knew him; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby recognize and honor the life of Columbus Firefighter Greg Bauer and expresses our sincere condolences to his family, his Division of Fire colleagues, and loved ones.",
