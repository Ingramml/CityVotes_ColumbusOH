    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance modifies an existing grant agreement with Columbus Urban League originally ordained via ordinance 0472-2021 and amended via ordinance 1490-2021 to increase the funding amount to support additional residents.\n \nOrdinance 0472-2021 continued the Right to Recover program, a Council initiative to provide emergency financial relief to low-income residents afflicted with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Since its creation in late 2020, the program has provided assistance to almost a thousand Columbus residents, and while the city’s positivity rate has declined significantly, the need remains to provide these types of social supports in order to achieve complete recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ordinance 1490-2021 extended the use of existing funds remaining from ordinance 0472-2021 until December 31, 2021 and included new provisions to help residents access vaccination.\n \nThe modified grant agreement will provide Columbus Urban League with the funding necessary to further support full vaccination for low-income residents.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Recovery fund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately modify the grant agreement and deploy additional resources through the Vaccine Green program.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify a grant agreement with Columbus Urban League originally authorized under ordinance 0472-2021 and amended under ordinance 1490-2021; to authorize an expenditure within the Recovery fund; and to declare an emergency. ($220,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in disproportionate public health impacts in communities of color and low-income communities across the nation; and\n \nWHEREAS, expenditure of American Rescue Plan Act funding to support vaccine incentives will address the significant inequities in public health outcomes in the City of Columbus’ most distressed neighborhoods caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Right to Recover program is a Council initiative to provide emergency financial relief to low-income residents afflicted with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis; and\n \nWHEREAS, since its creation in late 2020, the program has provided assistance to almost a thousand Columbus residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance modifies an existing grant agreement with Columbus Urban League to administer the Right to Recover program; and\n \nWHEREAS, there is empirical data that suggests a significant degree of vaccine hesitancy, or a resistance to acquiring the vaccine because of fears of the short-term adverse effects sometimes associated with the COVID-19 vaccine; and\n \nWHEREAS, residents working low-wage jobs, who are also less likely to have paid time off or sufficient savings accrued, also face a financial barrier to taking the time off work needed to get themselves and their families vaccinated;\n \nWHEREAS, improving vaccination rates is demonstrably the fastest, most effective means by which to slow the spread of COVID-19 within the community, particularly within those communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the spread of the virus; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the existing grant agreement with Columbus Urban League in order to rapidly deploy the resources needed to provide vaccination incentives; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify the grant agreement with Columbus Urban League authorized by ordinance 0472-2021 and amended by ordinance 1490-2021.\n \nSECTION 2. That per the action authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $220,000.00 or so much thereof as needed within the Recovery fund, fund 2209, is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
