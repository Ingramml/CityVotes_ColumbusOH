    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for the purchase of light duty trucks and associated up-fitting for various city divisions. The purchase orders for the vehicle purchases will be issued from a Universal Term Contract (UTC) that was previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. Purchase orders for vehicle up-fitting will be issued pursuant to bids for dump truck up-fitting that were processed in accordance with Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders with George Byers Sons Inc, (PA004790) for the acquisition of light duty trucks by the Fleet Management Division for subsequent distribution to various divisions within the City.\n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, vendor#006008, CC# 31-4139860 exp. 12/3/2022, PA004790 - ($932,126.00 estimated)\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish a purchase order with ACE Truck Body Inc in the amount of $19,195.00 for the purchase of one (1) dump truck up-fitting per the results of bid RFQ019594.  The trailer will be utilized by the Division of Recreation and Parks in various parks maintenance projects. This bid was processed in accordance with the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code. Two responses were received and opened for RFQ019594 on August 27, 2021 as follows:\n \nACE Truck Body Inc (CC#: 310936828, exp. 9/7/2023, MAJ) $19,195.00\nHYO Inc, (CC#: 311201883, exp. 3/16/23, MAJ) $24,527.00\n \nThe Finance and Management Department therefore recommends the bid be awarded to ACE Truck Body Inc, as the lowest, most responsive and responsible bidder.\n \nACE Truck Body Inc. Vendor #004484, Certification EBO_CC, non MBE/FBE\n \nThese vehicles are to be purchased as replacements for older, high mileage, and high maintenance vehicles currently in service.  These vehicles are fuel efficient and will relieve the city of maintenance expenses and general upkeep costs.  Investing in these units will reduce overall maintenance costs and petroleum fuel consumption. \n \nThe projected quantities to be purchased by vehicle and quantity are contained in the summary attached to this ordinance. (See Ord 2667-2021 Vehicle Distribution.xls)\n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: A total of $951,321.00 will be expended from the Special Income Tax Fund. $7.2 million was budgeted for 2021 Citywide Vehicle Acquisitions.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that vehicle acquisitions can be processed as soon as possible. The market volatility of all the vehicle manufactures increases with the continued shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. Therefore, it would be beneficial to move forward with vehicle acquisitions as soon as possible to mitigate any potential delays. \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles for use by various City Departments with Byers Ford; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish a purchase order with ACE Truck Body Inc for the purchase of one dump truck up-fitting; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $951,321.00 from the Special Income Tax Fund; and to declare an emergency.
