    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with AECOM Technical Services (fka URS Corporation - Ohio) for the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) Concept Plan Update Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690539-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2060.\n \nThis project will update the current PAWP Concept Plan document and evaluate activities within the general vicinity of the PAWP Wellfield.  It will also include evaluation of the proposed wellfield expansion site in Pickaway County, locating potential new well sites in Franklin County, and examining the benefits and risks of using the City’s current wells versus becoming a surface water plant.\n \nProperty acquisition efforts have been challenging due to market conditions and a lack of willing sellers.  As a result, the DOW’s property search activities have been taking longer than originally anticipated, which has extended the time frame for needing support from this consultant team.  A modification to the contract is needed to extend the contract through July 2023 to allow it to support ongoing property acquisition efforts.\n \nWork under this contract modification will include well site evaluation services, which may include developing figures and other information to support City discussions with land owners, groundwater modeling, geotechnical investigations, installation of monitoring wells, water quality sampling and testing, and well pump testing.   \n \nCommunity Planning Area: “99 - Citywide”\n \nThis Ordinance will also authorize the renewal of past, present, and future contracts and purchase orders with URS Corporation - Ohio, FID #34-0939859 to AECOM Technical Services, Inc., FID #95-2661922.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $500,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $   897,900.00                     (EL016521)\nMod. 1 (current):                     $   500,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Mod. 1):                     $1,397,900.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis consultant team has unique knowledge of the groundwater conditions in the area of interest, which allows them to provide support to the City in an expedited manner.  The DOW has property acquisition efforts underway the require consultant support.  Bidding this out could interrupt the City’s property acquisition efforts and potentially cause the City to miss out on an opportunity to purchase needed property.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe consultant prepared an estimated scope and fee that was based on other similar work recently completely.  The City PM reviewed the scope and fee and worked with the consultant to refine as needed.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project is necessary to prepare for anticipated water demands in the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) service area and to help the City replace well supply that will be lost to mining activities.  The PAWP is an essential and integral component in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate supply of water is essential to economic growth and development.  Community outreach is not expected to be needed, but will be conducted if necessary.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  95-2661922, expires 7/22/22, MAJ, DAX No. 10897\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against AECOM Technical Services.\n \n4.  FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  N/A\n \n5.
