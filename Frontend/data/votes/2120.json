    "title": "To amend the Department of Public Service’s 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the amendment of the Department of Public Service’s 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to align budget authority and cash related to the Vision Zero Columbus program and the Roadway - Sullivant Ave - Hague to I70 project.\n \nSome capital improvement contracts are completed for less than the contracted amount.  This is primarily due to contingency funding not being needed or the contract work being completed for less than the contracted amount.  The Department of Public Service periodically closes the purchase orders and other encumbrance documents for these projects and cancels the remaining funding on them so the funding is available to use on other projects.  For one of these cancellation rounds, the Department of Finance and Management designated that the cancelled funding would be used to partially fund the Department of Public Service’s capital budget request for the Vision Zero Columbus program.  Vision Zero Columbus is a program focused on ending crash related fatalities and serious injuries on our streets while increasing safe, healthy, and equitable mobility for all.  An ordinance is required to align budget authority and cash from the completed projects to Vision Zero Columbus.\n \nThe Department of Public Service is engaged in the Roadway - Sullivant Ave - Hague to I70 project. This project will replace and repair sidewalks, enhance pedestrian safety, repair the roadway, rehabilitate alleys, replace traffic signals and signs, add LED street lights, mitigate stormwater ponding, and also install artistic lighting at the I-70 bridge underpass.  The work is being performed using existing contracts, newly bid contracts, and Department of Public Service labor funded out of the operating budget.  The Department of Public Service reimburses itself for operating budget labor and existing contracts used for capital eligible work performed on projects, which to-date on this project includes: retaining wall repairs; driveway apron replacements; milling, filling, and crack sealing of roadway surfaces; sidewalk repair; installation of signage and pavement marking; and design services.  An ordinance is required to move budget authority and cash to perform these reimbursements.          \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere are no expenditures associated with this ordinance.  It is necessary to modify the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget to match cash for cancelled encumbrance documents, to align budget authority with the proper projects, and to transfer cash and appropriation to projects where it is anticipated the cash will eventually be expended.  Separate ordinances will be submitted for Council consideration and approval for expenditures of any of the funding moved by this ordinance.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to allow the funding to be available as quickly as possible to allow new projects to be initiated and completed that will increase the safety of the traveling public. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the Department of Public Service’s 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, cancellations of unused funding for completed projects were performed; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service has a need to fund the Vision Zero Columbus program, and\n \nWHEREAS, the unused funds that were cancelled are now available for use on other projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is engaged in the Roadway - Sullivant Ave - Hague to I70 project; and\n \nWHEREAS, contracts and labor were used for this project that need to be reimbursed with project funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget and to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for these funds to be available for use and reimbursement; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to make said amendments and transfers as quickly as possible to allow new projects to be initiated and completed that will increase the safety of the traveling public, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  \n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget authorized by ordinance 2521-2020 be amended as follows to establish sufficient authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project / Project Name / C.I.B. / Change / C.I.B. as Amended\n7704 / P440104-100000 / Misc Economic Development (Voted Carryover) / $4,042.00 / $223,494.00 / $227,536.00 (To match cash)\n7704 / P441759-100000 / SR315-Ramp 6C Removal (Voted Carryover) / $1,435.00 / $83,583.00 / $85,018.00 (To match cash)\n7704 / P470042-100000 / Facilities - Accela Upgrade/Replacement (Voted Carryover) / $0.00 / $2,700.00 / $2,700.00 (To match cash)\n7704 / P530053-100000 / Short North SID (Voted Carryover) / $0.00 / $125,526.00 / $125,526.00 (To match cash)\n7704 / P530086-100000 / 59-03 Misc.
