Project improvements include bike lanes, sidewalks, street trees, drainage, waterline improvements, replacement of traffic signals, and relocating overhead utilities underground.\n \nIn the course of effecting roadway improvements, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements or place overhead utilities underground to promote public health, safety and the welfare including the economic development of the City. These relocations are in areas where the City has previously allowed utilities, but established an underground utility district by ordinance 0307-2015.    \n \nThe funding request for utilities relocation is based upon estimates from the utilities.  The utilities will invoice the City for actual costs incurred in relocating the utilities.  The amount needed may exceed the amount requested in this ordinance.  Additional legislation will be submitted by the Department of Public Service if additional funds are needed to complete the relocations.     \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds for this project are available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704.   An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget and transfer of funding is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Funds are appropriated.\n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested to provide funding for utility reimbursements at the earliest possible time to maintain the project construction schedule to ensure the safety of the travelling public.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to pay utility relocation costs to various utilities for the Roadway Improvements - Livingston Avenue Phase B - High Street to Fifth Street project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $502,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for these utility relocations; and to declare an emergency.  ($502,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is concerned with the use of the various rights-of-way areas in the City as such rights-of-way areas represent a valuable and limited resource that must be utilized to promote the public health, safety and welfare including the economic development of the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is engaged in the Roadway Improvements - Livingston Avenue Phase B - High Street to Fifth Street project; and \n \nWHEREAS, the project involves widening Livingston Avenue from Short Street to Kennedy Avenue.
