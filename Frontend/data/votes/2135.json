    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract and issue a purchase order as needed with Victor Stanley, Inc., in order to purchase twenty Metal Street Litter Receptacles, for the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection.  This purchase will assist the Division with replacing 20 existing litter receptacles along City streets in downtown, and the Short North.\n \nThe Purchasing Office advertised and solicited a competitive bid in accordance with City Code Section 329.06 (RFQ019112) through Vendor Services.  The City received three bids that were received and opened on July 2, 2021, as follows:  \n \n                     Company Name                                            Bid Amount                                 City/State                            Majority/MBE/FBE\nVictor Stanley, Inc.                                                  $22,120.00                               Dunkirk, MD                                   Majority                     \n                     Grainger                                                                       $14,840.00                               Palantine, IL                                            Majority\n                       Holzberg Communications, Inc.   $21,339.60                               Totowa, NJ                                            Majority\n \n \n \nThe award is to be made to Victor Stanley, Inc., as the responsible and best bidder for all lines of its bid of $22,120.00. The Purchasing Department approved the award to Victor Stanley Inc. because Grainger and Holzberg Communications did not meet the required specifications for the receptacle, or could not provide the receptacle due to supply chain constraints. Grainger removed themselves from consideration due to supply chain constraints, and Holzberg submitted a bid that did not include a side opening door, and were therefore unresponsive.  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Victor Stanley, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Victor Stanley, Inc. is CC009006 and expired 07/19/2019.  The vendor will need to update their registration, before a contract can be executed and a purchase order can be issued.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated for this purchase within the Refuse Bond Fund, Fund 7703.  \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to expedite delivery of the waste receptacles for immediate use to replace damaged units in the City right of way locations downtown and in the Short North.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with Victor Stanley, Inc., for the purchase of twenty metal street litter receptacles; to authorize the expenditure of up to $22,120.00 from the Refuse Bond Fund to purchase the receptacles; and to declare an emergency.
