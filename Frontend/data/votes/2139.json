    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for the purchase of automobiles and light duty trucks for the Columbus Division of Police, as well as associated vehicle cameras, computers, and upfitting. The purchase orders for the vehicle purchases will be issued from Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) that have been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. The vehicle cameras and computers will be purchased through a State of Ohio cooperative contract. In addition, this ordinance also authorizes the purchase of a cargo trailer for the Division of Police, which was procured via a competitive in accordance with Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nIn accordance with the aforementioned, this ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders with George Byers Sons Inc, (PA004790 & PA004948) for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks by the Fleet Management Division for subsequent distribution to the Division of Police, and with Parr Public Safety Equipment Inc (PA005468) for the associated purchase of police vehicle upfitting.\n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, vendor#006008, CC# 31-4139860 exp. 12/3/2022, PA004790 & PA004948, expires 6/30/23 - ($3,381,075.00 estimated)\nParr Public Safety Equipment Inc, vendor#001060, CC# 201619573 exp. 8/25/2023, PA005468, expires 12/31/24 - ($1,371,045.75 estimated)\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders with ARC Acquisition US Inc for the purchase of Panasonic tablets and necessary hardware/accessories to be installed on police vehicles, and Motorola Solutions for the purchase of vehicle cameras and associated hardware. Ordinance #582-87 authorizes City agencies to participate in Ohio Department of Administrative Services (DAS) cooperative contracts. Using the DAS contract is advantageous for the City because it would not be cost effective to use resources to do a competitive process. Any savings to the City through its own bid would not be substantial. \n \nThe Arc Acquisition, Inc. (vendor #025070) contract 534604-5 expires 9/26/24. (296,437.50)\nMotorola Solutions (vendor #007169) contract 573077-0-1 expires 6/30/23. ($392,125.50)\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish a purchase order with Rocks Trailer Sales in the amount of $37,889.00 for the purchase of one (1) cargo trailer per the results of bid RFQ019741.  The trailer will be utilized by the Division of Police to transport bicycles. This bid was processed in accordance with the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code. Two responses were received and opened for RFQ019741 on September 15, 2021 as follows:\n \nRocks Trailer Sales (CC#: CC004623, exp. 9/28/23, MAJ) $37,889.00\nJC Enterprises, (CC#: CC008983, exp. 3/2/22, MAJ) $46,972.00\n \nThe Finance and Management Department therefore recommends the bid be awarded to Rocks Trailer Sales, as the lowest, most responsive and responsible bidder.\n \nRocks Trailer Sales. Vendor #004623, Certification EBO_CC, non MBE/FBE\n \nThese vehicles are to be purchased as replacements for older, high mileage, and high maintenance vehicles currently in service. These vehicles are fuel efficient and will relieve the city of maintenance expenses and general upkeep costs. Investing in these units will reduce overall maintenance costs and petroleum fuel consumption. \n \nThe projected quantities to be purchased by vehicle and quantity are contained in the summary attached to this ordinance. (See Ord 2551-2021 Vehicle Distribution.xls)\n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract as per the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: A total of $5,000,000.00 will be spent from the General Permanent Improvement Fund and $478,572.25 will be spend from the Special Income Tax Fund. $7.2 million was budgeted for the 2021 Citywide Vehicle Acquisitions.\n \nEmergency action is requested. The market volatility of all the automobile manufactures increases with the continued shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. In addition, General Motors (GM) recently announced that all government truck orders for GM have been halted for model year 2022 because of supply line shortages. The Fleet Management Division is concerned that Ford may soon follow by halting additional orders into late 2022, which would leave the City of Columbus without options to replace over life-cycle vehicles. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Ford related orders can be placed as soon as possible. \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles for use by the Division of Police with Byers Ford and Parr Public Safety; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders with ARC Acquisition and Motorola Solutions for the purchase of tablets and cameras and the necessary hardware/accessories to be installed on Division of Police vehicles, in accordance with the terms and conditions of State of Ohio Cooperative Contracts;  to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish a purchase order with Rocks Trailer Sales for the purchase of a cargo trailer for use by the Division of Police; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $5,000,000.00 from the General Permanent Improvement Fund and $478,572.25 from the Special Income Tax Fund; to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds between projects within the General Permanent Improvement Fund; and to declare an emergency.
