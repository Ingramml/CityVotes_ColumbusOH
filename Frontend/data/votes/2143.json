    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the neighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).  \n \nThe Division of Water is also participating in the project to rehabilitate approximately 2,300 linear feet of 8-inch water mains in the water distribution system area bounded by Mooberry Road, Livingston Avenue, Eighteenth Avenue, and Miller Avenue.\n \nThis contract renewal will provide the funding necessary to conduct additional public meetings and outreach, complete the designs of the GI and private property work as well as the assembly of the bid documents for each of the phases.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $ 1,157,783.19\n                     Original Contract                                          $   999,911.92\n                     Renewal #1                                          $1,017,273.17\n                     Renewal #2 (current)                                          $1,157,783.19 \n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                         $3,174,968.28\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThis is a planned contract modification/renewal and the additional services were identified in the original contract ordinance.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant. In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost estimate for the proposed scope of work was prepared by Arcadis U.S., Inc. and reviewed by DOSD.  \n \n2. PROJECT TIMELINE: It is anticipated that this renewal will be for a term of 5 years.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n    \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  57-0373224 | MAJ | Exp. 3/18/2023 | Vendor # 009409\n5. ECONOMIC IMPACT: This project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the neighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).\n \nThe goal of the water line project is to rehabilitate the existing 6-inch and 8-inch water lines that have a high break frequency.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss.  \n \nCommunity outreach is big part of these projects and the initial public meetings have been held.  Subsequent meetings with other interested, neighborhood committees have also been held to inform them of the potential changes.\n \n6.
