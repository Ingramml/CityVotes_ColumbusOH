    "description": "Title\n \nTo Honor and Recognize Sanborn “Sandy\" Wood  on  Being Inducted into the City of Columbus Hall of Fame 2020\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the members of Columbus City Council are proud to honor and recognize Sanborn “Sandy” Wood on being inducted into the City of Columbus’ Hall of Fame 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, Sandy is a well-known figure throughout the Short North. It goes without saying that those who live and work in the now-vital arts corridor consider him one of the founders of their reborn neighborhood; and\n \nWHEREAS, rarely does Sandy say “I” built something or started a mission, but always “we”. He never brags, just offers information; and\n \nWHEREAS, Sandy was one of the early investors buying crime-ridden properties and old Victorian homes and making them safe, clean and affordable. The Carriage house is a prime example. They kept the character of the early storefront and turned it into one of best restaurants in town, office space and apartments. They anchored a lot of buildings that were the birth of the neighborhood; and\n \nWHEREAS, Sandy put fanatical energy into the Short North Special Improvement District (SID). Establishing SIDs can be very difficult to say the least. These special taxing districts require approval of 60 percent of the property owners to agree to a special tax assessment - and to increased taxes to pay for a slate of improvements like street cleaning graffiti removal, and more. That finally happen in 1997, the city was persuaded to partially match funds. Sandy is credited with raising the concept of the SID and seeing it through.  The Short North Neighborhood is a gem in our city thanks to Sanborn “Sandy” Wood: therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: that this council hereby honors and recognizes Sanborn “Sandy” Wood on being inducted into the City of Columbus’ Hall of Fame.",
