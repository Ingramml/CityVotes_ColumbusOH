($750,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Advanced Metering System (AMS) Study and Implementation Project, Division of Water Contract No. 2073.\n \nUnder Original Contract No. EL017444, the Department of Public Utilities contracted with EMA, Inc. to assist in Phase 1 of the contract which was to develop and recommend a strategy, roadmap, and implementation plan of an Advanced Metering System (AMS) for water and electric meters. Under this phase, EMA, Inc. evaluated state-of-the-art AMS technologies; evaluated and compared cost impacts; developed a detailed implementation schedule; and assisted the City in budgetary planning efforts.\n \nModification No. 1 occurred in May 2017 to procure Phase 2 Services, which included preparation of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an AMS system that clearly defined the City’s objectives and requirements.  \n \nModification No. 2 occurred in June 2019 to provide Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services, which included coordination of the AMS System vendor selection process, assisting the City in negotiating the technical requirements of the project so a final scope and cost could be determined for the project solution, and program management assistance. \n \nModification No. 3 (current) is a planned modification to continue providing Phase 3 and Phase 4 services.  These services include continued coordination of AMS business process development and program management assistance during the implementation of the project. Examples of the expected work in these phases include:\nA.                       Provide project management and oversight for the project\nB.                       Provide risk management and communication plans during the life of the project\nC.                       Coordinate the system installation, system interface development, and testing plans\nD.                       Provide planning and implementation of business process redesign for the new solution\nE.                       Maintain responsibility for vendor contract management and implementation management\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $750,000.00\nOriginal agreement:                     $369,077.71  (EL017444)\nModification No. 1:                     $550,000.00  (PO065223)\nModification No. 2:                     $750,000.00  (PO218378)\nModification No. 3 (current):                     $750,000.00\nTotal to Date:                     $2,419,077.71\n \n 1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a planned modification as indicated in the original authorizing legislation (Ord. No. 1597-2015), Modification No. 1 (Ord. No. 0797-2017), and Modification No. 2 (Ord. No. 1847-2019).\n \nAdditional modifications are expected during future phases.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nModifications to the agreement were planned as part of the original Request for Proposals RFP.  Additionally, the current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the work to-date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will further delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by EMA, Inc.  The proposal was reviewed by Department staff and deemed acceptable.\n \n2.0 FUTURE CONTRACT MODIFICATION(S):  Future modifications are anticipated to complete Phase 3 and Phase 4 services, which include continued coordination of AMS business process development and program management assistance during the implementation of the project.\n \nThe planning area is “City Wide” because this project serves multiple planning areas.\n \n3.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  An AMS program is favorable to the DPU’s operations and customer service function, as replacing older water and electrical meters will improve service, decrease burden on maintenance operations, reduce water loss, improve revenue, and improve customer access to billing and consumption history. The AMS program will allow moving from quarterly to monthly billing in the future and will have a positive impact on customers as the bills will be more manageable in both cost and time.\n \n4.0 CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  41-1467091; expires 10/7/23, Majority.  DAX Vendor No. is 007843.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against EMA, Inc.\n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  There is sufficient cash and budgetary authority for this project within the Water G.O. Bond Fund - Fund No. 6006. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned modification of the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Advanced Metering System Project; for the Division of Water; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $750,000.00 from the Water General Obligations Bond Fund.  ($750,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. EL017444 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1597-2015, passed July 20, 2015, was executed on August 21, 2015, and approved by the City Attorney on September 2, 2015, for the Advanced Metering System Study and Implementation Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 1 under Contract No. PO065223 was authorized by Ordinance No. 0797-2017, passed May 1, 2017, was executed on June 2, 2017, approved by the City Attorney on June 6, 2017, and established funding for Phase 2, preparing a Request for Proposal (RFP); and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 2 under Contract No. PO218378 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1847-2019, passed July 29, 2019, was executed on March 10, 2020, approved by the City Attorney on March 12, 2020, and established funding for Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services, which include continued coordination of the AMS System vendor selection process and program management assistance during the implementation of the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 3 (current) is necessary to continue providing Phase 3 and Phase 4 services which include continued coordination of AMS business process development and program management assistance during the implementation of the project; and \n \nWHEREAS, future modifications are anticipated to complete Phases 3 and 4 of the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Advanced Metering System Study and Implementation Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
