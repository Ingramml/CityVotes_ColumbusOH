The lengthy process for initiating a new procurement, and for a new entity to gain understanding of the project, would likely cause an unacceptable project delay and additional cost.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the renewal was determined by cost analysis of prior DOSD roof replacement projects. \n2.   Project Timeline:  This will be a one year contract, with an option for the City to renew annually for an additional 4 years. The duration of the contract may extend into subsequent years based on the complexity and progress of the assigned work. The anticipated that this contact will conclude 12/31/2023.\n \n3.   Contract Compliance No.:  13-6094431 | MAJ | Exp.  5/12/2022 | Vendor # 025646\n \n4.  Economic / Environment Impact:   The performance of this project’s work activities to address replacement and repair of DPU roofs and roofing components will prevent moisture damage to process equipment, electrical components and other interior furnishings and equipment.
