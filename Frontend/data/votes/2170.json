    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the Director of the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to enter into an agreement with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc., for PragmaCAD software maintenance and support services, for the coverage term period through December 31, 2022, at a cost of $51,936.00.  The PragmaCAD system provides the Department of Public Utilities with a Mobile Dispatching System which enables the Department of Public Utilities to optimize service order assignments, assign them to technicians in the field, and capture field information for immediate use.  This software and system are expected to continue to make the Department more responsive to customers.  The Mobile Dispatching System interfaces with the current work order system in use, known as CUBS/Banner, as well as with the AVL system.  \n \nCGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. (CGI) is the sole source provider of the PragmaCAD source code and the Banner interface, both developed and retained by CGI, and no other party is allowed to install, modify, or support this proprietary code.  Therefore, CGI is the sole provider for services (and does not utilize distributors or resellers to provide maintenance and support, or professional services for its software products) performed in relation to PragmaCAD and the Banner interface software, so this ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the provisions of the Sole Source procurement of the City of Columbus Code, Chapter 329. \n \n \nThis ordinance will also authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify and extend existing agreements with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. through the extension of purchase order PO231970.  There are no additional funds associated with this extension, the extension makes/allows the remaining unspent balance of funds on PO231970 available through 12/17/2022.  On June 15, 2020, Ord. No. 1164-2020 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), to enter into an agreement to upgrade DPU's PragmaCAD system from version 6.7 to version 7.0.  Due to the continued circumstances and demands of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Mobile Dispatching PragmaCAD upgrade project was delayed.  All parties involved in this project (DPU, DoT and CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc.) have agreed to pursue the extension of the current PO (PO231970) for an additional year through December 17, 2022.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   \nThis ordinance will allow for funding in the amount of $51,936.00 for PragmaCAD software maintenance and support services with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc  Funding is available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund.   \n    \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \nVendor Name:  CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc.;  CC#/F.I/D. #: 54-0856778;  Expiration Date:  07/15/2023\nDAX City Vendor Acct. #:  009176\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology on behalf of the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. for PragmaCAD software maintenance and support services;  in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Director of the Department of Public Utilities, to modify and extend existing agreements with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc.;  and to authorize the expenditure of $51,936.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund.
