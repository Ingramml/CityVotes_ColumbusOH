($71,850.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to renew a contract with Saitech, Inc. for software licenses maintenance and support at a cost of $71,850.00 and shall provide coverage for the term period of December 23, 2021 through December 22, 2022. The software license maintenance and support was originally procured through solicitation number RFQ010393 and included options to renew for four (4) additional one-year terms at the same pricing and the same escalator clause. This ordinance represents the third renewal option. \n \nThe Veeam licenses are critical to the department’s infrastructure and network backup system. Renewal of this license is necessary for protection from events such as data corruption, accidental data deletion, malicious attacks (e.g., recovering from Ransomware, etc.), and natural disasters that could take down a city data center (e.g., tornados, fires). The total cost for this renewal is $71,850.00 for one year, from December 23, 2021 through December 22, 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nIn 2019 and 2020, expenditures of $58,350.00 and $67,342.50 were legislated respectively to renew the Veeam software licenses.
