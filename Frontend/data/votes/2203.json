    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance will authorize the Director of Finance and Management to donate five (5) used vehicles to Columbus State Community College (CSCC). CSCC has a need for vehicles to be used in their educational programs. These vehicles are beyond their useful life and were slated to be made available through the City's auction process. The need for these vehicles came about as the result of a programming partnership with Ford that is coming to an end. Ford is discontinuing its program, which provided vehicles for hands-on automotive industry training. The end of this partnership will leave CSCC with few resources to continue these efforts and educational programs. \n \nCSCC has been instrumental in providing grant supported training to many City of Columbus technicians for electric and hybrid vehicles during 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the Division of Fleet Management has worked closely with CSCC in creating, planning and implementing substantial training support for many alternative fuel vehicles. There is also a potential pipe line for students to enter the workforce with Fleet Management.\n \nThe vehicles to be donated are as follows:\n \nBT#24985 2012 Ford Fusion\nBT#23177 2010 Chevy Tahoe\nBT#26032 2011 Kia Sorento\nBT#27446 2017 Ford Interceptor\nBT#23174 2010 Chevy Tahoe\n \nThese vehicles have been taken out of service and as such can be made available for public auction or donation. To this end, the Division of Fleet Management would like to donate the used vehicles to Columbus State Community College to assist with their operational need in the service of our residents.\nThe vehicles will be titled to Columbus State as directed by CSCC employees. \n \nEmergency action is being requested so that the City can coordinate with Columbus State Community College to deliver the vehicles so that there would be no interruption in the educational programs.\n \nFiscal Impact:  None.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Finance and Management to donate to Columbus State Community College five (5) used vehicles; to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 relating to the Sale of City Owned Personal Property; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus State Community College is in need of used vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Fleet Management is disposing of five (5) used vehicles that have been taken out of service; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the City's best interest to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 relating to the Sale of City Owned Personal Property to make this donation; and\n \nWHEREAS,  an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to donate five (5) vehicles that are beyond their useful life to Columbus State Community College so that there would be no interruption in the educational programs, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety; NOW, THEREFORE \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department Finance and Management be and is hereby authorized and directed to donate five (5) used vehicles. The vehicles to be donated are as follows:\n \nBT#24985 2012 Ford Fusion\nBT#23177 2010 Chevy Tahoe\nBT#26032 2011 Kia Sorento\nBT#27446 2017 Ford Interceptor\nBT#23174 2010 Chevy Tahoe\n \n \nSECTION 2.  That this Council finds it to be in the best interests of the City to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to the Sale of City-Owned Personal Property in order to donate these vehicles to Columbus State Community College.\n \nSECTION 3.
