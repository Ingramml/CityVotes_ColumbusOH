    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with HNTB Ohio, Inc., in an amount of up to $1,200,000.00 for the Signals - Downtown Signal Conduit Investigation project.\n \nUnderground conduit is an important component of our traffic signal network infrastructure.  The conduit houses cables that allow our traffic signal network to function and communicate effectively.  Over time, the conduit ages and is subject to collapse - which complicates maintenance and potentially compromises signal communications.  Also, permits that require underground work within the public right-of-way must be reviewed to ensure that there are no conflicts with the conduit and other underground infrastructure.  Currently, much of the information needed to complete these reviews requires retrieving and reading through record plans to gather some of the needed information.\n \nThis project aims to address these issues through multiple efforts.  The work will consist of performing thorough field investigations to gather information on the condition of the existing conduit in the Downtown Business District, developing a simplified plan set for any needed repairs, and creating a GIS map database of the conduit locations.  The resulting GIS database will reduce the time and effort to gather background information that may be needed by our teams that review information for Capital Improvement Projects, permits and maintenance operations by consolidating some of the information in one place.  The conduit repairs will improve maintenance operations by making repairs more efficient when operations teams need to respond.\n \nThe Department of Public Service, Office of Support Services, solicited Requests for Proposals for the Signals - Downtown Signal Conduit Investigation contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services website and Bonfire from September 7, 2021, to September 28, 2021.  The City received one response.  The proposal was deemed responsive and was fully evaluated by the evaluation committee.  The responding firm was:  \n \nCompany Name                                                      City/State            Majority/MBE/MBR/F1/AS1/PHC\nHNTB Ohio, Inc.                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                          Majority\n \nHNTB Ohio, Inc. received 90.33 points from the Evaluation Committee out of a possible 100 and will be awarded the Signals - Downtown Signal Conduit Investigation contract.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against HNTB Ohio, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for HNTB Ohio, Inc. is CC008025 and expires 04/01/2022.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is budgeted, available, and appropriated within Fund 2265, the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so design of these safety improvements can be started as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with HNTB Ohio, Inc. for the Signals - Downtown Signal Conduit Investigation project;
