    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation and transfer of funds within the Reimaging Safety subfund to the Workforce Development of Central Ohio for the workforce development portion of Unleashing Potential (UP) court program in Franklin County Municipal Court Judge D’Varga’s courtroom. The UP program will provide transformative justice for potential emerging adults who have come into contact with our justice system and are at risk for continued criminal behavior due to lack of resources and a support system.\nEmerging adults, defined as individuals transitioning from childhood to adulthood between the ages of 18 and 25, are in an age category where cognitive skills and emotional intelligence continues to develop.  While emerging adults make up ten percent of the U.S. population, in Ohio, emerging adults represented 18% of total arrests in 2016.  Nationwide, emerging adults represent 29% of arrests.\nIndividuals in this age bracket can naturally age out of criminal activities as their cognitive skills develop when they are provided the support and opportunities necessary to become independent, productive members of their communities.\nUP is intended for justice-involved individuals’ age 18-25 years, with a moderate-high risk of recidivism and high level of criminogenic needs. Eligibility will be based on the nature and type of charges filed, as well as that defendant’s prior criminal history. Charges generally must be non-violent in nature, but cases will be considered on a case by case basis. The program would provide health and behavioral health services/trauma informed care, parenting services/support, successful navigation of public assistance programs, drivers licensing and transportation assistance, education and workforce development utilizing Workforce Development of Central Ohio’s AMP (Achieve More & Prosper) program, safe stable, affordable housing, and family/community support.\nParticipation in the program is usually one year or longer, depending on the individual’s needs and progress.  To successfully graduate the participants must demonstrate adherence to their action plans.  Upon graduation, the case will be resolved pursuant to the negotiated agreement (either reduction of the charge or dismissal of the charge) between the prosecuting attorney, defense attorney and the court.\nThe goals of UP court program are to ensure public safety and reduce recidivism, increase the assets of young adults to help them transform their lives, provide justice involved young adults with a meaningful path to reducing/eliminating their criminal record, and to increase collaboration between the court, counsel, city agencies, community based programs, and other health treatment services.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation within the Reimagine Safety subfund for the purpose of supporting the workforce development portion of the Unleashing Potential (UP); to authorize a transfer between the Reimagine Safety subfund and the general fund; to authorize an appropriation within the general fund; to authorize the Administrative and Presiding Judge to enter into contract with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio; and to declare an emergency.
