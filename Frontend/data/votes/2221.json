    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Star Consultants, Inc. in an amount up to $71,232.00 for professional services related to the redesign of the refuse station at 1550 Georgesville Road.\n \nThe original design contract was authorized by Ordinance No. 1992-2018 and approved by City Council on August 2, 2018. The modification of this contract is necessary to redesign the demolition of the Refuse Station into phases. This will allow the demolition project to be bid out into phases. This modification will also extend the contract to August 14, 2022. \n \nIt should also be noted that Ordinance 1239-2020 authorized a contract modification in the amount of $170,000.00 for additional services that were not anticipated in the original fee proposal for the demolition of the Refuse Station. The additional services include the relocation of proposed buildings and a change to the storm water storage to underground storage.\n \nPrices already established in the contract were used to determine the cost of this modification. \n \nThe contract compliance number for Star Consultants, Inc. is 31-1558857 and expires February 28, 2023.\n \nEmergency action is requested to provide funding for the contract modification so that the design of the existing renovation project can continue without delay. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $71,232.00 from the Refuse Bond Fund with Star Consultants, Inc. for professional services related to the redesign of the refuse station demolition at 1550 Georgesville Road.
