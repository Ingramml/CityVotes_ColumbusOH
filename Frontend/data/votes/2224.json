    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Department of Finance and Management, Fleet Management Division, to modify its existing contract with Ace Truck Body, Inc., to increase the contract amount. The original contract was awarded per the results of bid solicitation RFQ019251.\n \nThe original contract was entered into on October 18, 2021. The contract was established for $74,495.00 and Ace Truck Body was the only respondent. Since the initial quote was issued the manufacturer of the service truck has experienced a price increase due to the increasing cost of steel and auto parts, and can only hold pricing for orders received prior to that increase, thereby an additional $8,000.00 is being requested\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nAce Truck Body Inc., (CC#: 310936828, exp. 9/7/23, MAJ) $8,000.00\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an appropriation and expenditure of $8,000.00 from the Fleet Management Capital Fund with Ace Truck Body, Inc. for the purchase of one (1) tire service truck upfitting.
