    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, is currently engaged in a project identified as the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - SR161 I-71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase 1 project.  The project is the first phase of a series of projects that will make improvements to SR161 between I-71 and Cleveland Avenue, with a focus on the side streets north and south of SR161.  This project will replace the existing traffic signal at SR161 and Maple Canyon Avenue, install a shared use path, curb, curb ramps and street lighting. Side street improvements along Maple Canyon Avenue include reconstruction, widening, resurfacing, new sidewalk, median, the installation of urban mini roundabouts at the northern and southern end of the project, and new street lighting and stormwater drainage.                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                             \nDuring design of the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - SR161 I-71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase 1 project, it was determined a portion of real property owned by the City of Columbus known as 5750 Maple Canyon Avenue (aka Fire Station 6), Franklin County Parcel Number 010-111267, totaling 0.040 acre, would need to be dedicated as right-of-way for roadway purposes to accommodate the improvements contemplated by this project.
