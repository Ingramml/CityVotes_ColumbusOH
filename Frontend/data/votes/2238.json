    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into professional services contracts with Conduent State & Local Solutions, Inc. (Conduent) in the amount of up to $500,000.00 for the Dynamic Curb Lane Management contract.\n \nThe intent of this contract is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources for the design and implementation of a dynamic curb lane management (DCLM) system. Currently, loading zones are requested through an online permit application by an individual building owner or tenant. The current system also does not accurately price loading zones based on demand, and assigns the entire cost to a single entity, despite the loading zone being available to all users for the purpose of loading or unloading.\n \nThe proposed new system will establish a data-driven system for efficient placement of loading zones at the curb, and will allow for the management of multiple types of loading zones (e.g. commercial vehicle, passenger loading, temporary loading, multi-use). The system will create a vendor-facing and hosted platform to view availability, have the ability to reserve space, and pay for use of those zones. The system will require integration with existing parking payment and enforcement technology in use by the City, as well as implement new technologies to monitor and manage the loading zones. The main priorities for the new system are: to provide timely, real-time data; to supply the City of Columbus with a technology solution to manage and monetize access to curb space; to have a vendor-hosted system that will allow for online intake of information, validation of data, permitting, invoicing to the end-user, reporting, and fleet management capabilities.\nThe Department of Public Service, Office of Support Services, solicited Requests for Proposals for the Dynamic Curb Lane Management contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire web site from March 26, 2021, to May 13, 2021.  The city received eight (8) responses.  All proposals were deemed responsive and were fully evaluated when the Evaluation Committee met on May 20, 2021.  The two highest scoring firms, Conduent and IBM, were then invited to submit proposals and interview with the evaluation committee on June 15, 2021.  The final evaluation meeting was held on June 17, 2021, and the scores of the two firms interviewed were adjusted based on the presentations and interviews. The responding firms were:  \nCompany Name                          City/State                                 Majority/MBE/MBR/F1/AS1/PHC\nConduent                                                               Washington, DC                     Majority\nIBM                                                                                    Columbus, OH                                          Majority\nWisemoving                                                               Miami, FL                                          Unknown\nUmojo                                                                                    Chicago, IL                                          Unknown\ncurbFLOW                                                               Claymont, DE                                          Majority\nSpot Parking                                                               Centennial, CO                                          Unknown\nWalker Consulting                                          Indianapolis, IN                                          Majority\nSenSen                                                                                    Las Vegas, NV                                          Unknown\n \nConduent received the highest score by the evaluation committee and will be awarded the Dynamic Curb Lane Management contract.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Conduent.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nConduent’s contract compliance number is CC000606 and expires 06/07/2023.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be available within Fund 2268, the Parking Meter Fund upon transfer from Fund 1000, the General Fund.  Supplemental appropriation is required to establish sufficient budget authority for this and other projects dependent on the funds transferred.\n \n4.
