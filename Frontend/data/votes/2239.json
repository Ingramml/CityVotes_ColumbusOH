    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the FRA-70/71 Part 1 (4R) and Part 2 (6R) project, PID 105523. \n \nLocated within the corporate limits of the City of Columbus, the aforementioned project encompasses: construction of I-70 eastbound and Ramp C5 between 750' west of Souder Avenue and Front Street and the reconstruction of I-71 southbound between approximately 1300’ north of Greenlawn Avenue and Short Street, including widening and realigning I-71 northbound; partial reconfiguration of a system interchange; reconfiguration of local streets; construction of bridges and retaining walls; rehabilitation of the trunk line storm sewer; replacement of lighting; and traffic control upgrades. \n \nODOT previously intended to advertise FRA-70/71-12.68/14.86 (Project 4R), PID 105523, and FRA-71-14.36 (Project 6R), PID 105588, separately. Ordinance 2593-2019 and Ordinance 1384-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with ODOT relative to Project 4R and Project 6R, respectively. Ordinance 0538-2020 further authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide requisite funding, then estimated to be $2,218,258.00, to ODOT to support the location share of construction and inspection costs relative to Project 4R, resulting in the generation of a purchase order, PO219866, to support that expenditure.  However, final participatory legislation was never put forth relative to Project 6R because ODOT recently decided to advertise 4R and 6R together.\n \nThis ordinance seeks to grant the Director of Public Service the authority to execute any and all agreements with ODOT necessary to the completion of the FRA-70/71 Part 1 (4R) and Part 2 (6R) project, PID 105523. The encumbrance and expenditure of capital funding to support the local share of associated construction and inspection costs, presently estimated to be $3,298,210.00, previously was approved by City Council pursuant to Ordinance 2066-2019. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nAuditor’s Certificate ACPO004553 has been established, pursuant to Ordinance 2066-2019, to facilitate payment to ODOT for the proportionate share of anticipated project costs attributable to the Department of Public Service.  A purchase order, PO219866, already exists in the amount of $2,218,258.00 to support a substantial portion of those costs.  A purchase order in the amount of $1,079,952.00 will be issued against ACPO004553 for the balance of the funding ODOT has requested for these projects if Council approves this ordinance.    \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to maintain the schedule ODOT established for this project.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation for the FRA-70/71 Part 1 (4R) and Part 2 (6R) project; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is administering the FRA-70/71 Part 1 (4R) and Part 2 (6R) project, PID 105523, which will culminate in the reconstruction of portions of I-70/71 eastbound/northbound and the rehabilitation of two I-70 bridges over SR315; and \n \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned project is located within the Columbus corporate boundaries; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2593-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to grant consent and to agree to cooperate with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to FRA-70/71-12.68/14.86 (Project 4R), PID 105523; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0538-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide funding in the amount of up to $2,218,258.00 to ODOT to support the completion of Project 4R, resulting in the generation of a purchase order, PO219866, to support that expenditure; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1384-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with ODOT relative to FRA-71-14.36 (Project 6R), PID 105588; and \n \nWHEREAS, ODOT previously intended to advertise Project 4R and 6R separately but recently elected to consolidate and advertise those efforts together as a single solicitation; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to make payment to ODOT relative to the FRA-70/71 Part 1 (4R) and Part 2 (6R) project, PID 105523; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City agrees to assume and bear one hundred percent (100%) of the entire cost of the improvement within Columbus city limits, less the amount of Federal-Aid funds set aside by the Director of Transportation for the financing of this improvement from funds allocated by the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2066-2019 authorized the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funding to support the local share of construction and inspection costs, presently estimated to be $3,298,210.00; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize this ordinance to maintain the schedule ODOT established for this project, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to enter into agreement with and to make payment to the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the FRA-70/71 Part 1 (4R) and Part 2 (6R) project, PID 105523.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to contribute up to $3,298,210.00 to the Ohio Department of Transportation to support the aforementioned project pursuant to Auditor’s Certificate ACPO004553 and PO219866.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the mayor, or ten days after passage if the mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
