    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement (as a beneficiary) with Young Men’s Christian Association (known as YMCA Central Ohio), in an amount up to $531,693.00 using federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, to provide operational support to mitigate financial hardships, to implement COVID-19 prevention and mitigation tactics, to provide premium pay for essential workers at the Van Buren Center, and to pay for expenses starting March 3, 2021.  \n \nOrdinance 1201-2021 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate approximately $187,030,138.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds as signed into law by the President of the United States on March 11, 2021.\n \nYMCA of Central Ohio provides emergency shelter and wrap around services to homeless individuals.  At the Van Buren Center, shelter staff have worked directly, in person, with people experiencing a housing crisis throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  They have risked the health and well-being of themselves and their families to keep our neighbors experiencing homelessness safe. As an essential worker in the city’s critical infrastructure to address the housing crisis, front line staff are eligible for premium pay under the ARPA guidelines.\n \nFunding will also support additional cleaning services to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 at the Van Buren Center and will support retaining employees because of a decline in revenue due the public health emergency.\n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will be modified while this grant is in effect and it is requested that the Director of Development be given the authority to modify the terms and conditions of the grant without seeking additional Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 11, 2021. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006085 and expires 1/14/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Young Men’s Christian Association, known as YMCA Central Ohio, in an amount up to $531,693.00 using federal American Rescue Plan Act funds, to provide operational support to mitigate financial hardships, to implement COVID-19 prevention and mitigation tactics, to provide premium pay for essential workers at the Van Buren Center, and to pay for expenses starting March 3, 2021; to modify the terms and conditions of the grant agreement as needed without seeking further City Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance; to authorize the expenditure of up to $531,693.00 of ARPA funds; and to declare an emergency. ($531,693.00) (AMENDED BY ORD. 0340-2022; PASSED 2/7/2022)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, YMCA of Central Ohio, provides emergency shelter and wrap around services to homeless individuals; and\n \nWHEREAS, Van Buren Center shelter staff have worked directly, in person, with people experiencing a housing crisis throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  As an essential worker in the city’s critical infrastructure to address the housing crisis, front line staff are eligible for premium pay under the ARPA guidelines; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding will also support additional cleaning services to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 at the Van Buren Center and will support retaining employees because of a decline in revenue due the public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in negative impacts on the city’s shelter system, such as exposing front line workers to COVID, requiring additional cleaning of the congregate setting, and declining revenues; and \n \nWHEREAS, expenditure of ARPA funding to support organizations providing these services is necessary to alleviate the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, such expenditure of funds has not been previously accounted for in the 2021 Budget; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with the YMCA of Central Ohio to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency, such immediate action is necessary for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to enter into a grant agreement (as a beneficiary) with Young Men’s Christian Association (known as YMCA Central Ohio), in an amount up to $531,693.00 using federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, to provide operational support to mitigate financial hardships, to implement COVID-19 prevention and mitigation tactics, to provide premium pay for essential workers at the Van Buren Center, and to pay for expenses starting March 3, 2021; and to modify the terms and conditions of the grant agreement as needed without seeking further City Council approval. \n \nSECTION 2.
