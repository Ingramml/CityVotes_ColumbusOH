    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with EDGE Group, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the parkland design for the West Franklinton Parks Improvements Project. The contract amount is $82,436.00, with a contingency of $5,000.00, for a total of $87,436.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nFranklinton is recognized as the oldest community in Columbus, reaching back to the early 1800’s in its development. Located on the west side of downtown, Franklinton has become a diverse cross section of neighborhoods, from the arts district along the eastern edge, the redeveloping West Broad Street corridor, to dense single family housing in the western side. The West Franklinton community predominantly encompasses neighborhoods west of route 315 to Interstate 70 as well as from Interstate 670 to Mound Street on the south edge.   Like many older built-out communities, providing quality greenspace, recreation, and accessibility presents a significant development challenge for the long-term health and well-being of the community.  \n \nThis legislation will begin the design of improvements to three of West Franklinton’s largest public spaces, those being the wide street islands of Dakota Avenue, West Park Avenue, and Guilford Avenue.  The Department’s 2019 Land Plan shows that West Franklinton is per capita the most underserved community in the city for parks and recreation facilities.   A mere 10.8 acres of parkland exists in an inner city community of over 9,000 residents. To address some of this need, this project will design selected recreation improvements for the street islands, which combined are over 6.5 acres of public greenspace.  Over 6,000 residents live adjacent to or within a few minutes’ walk from these three sites. Since 2017, the Department has been collaborating with the Development Department and engaging with the Franklinton community on the potential of activating these greenspaces as small neighborhood parks with potential amenities such as walking paths, gathering spaces, and play spaces.  In 2019, the Franklinton Area Commission endorsed this project to move forward with Urban Infrastructure Recovery Funds (UIRF) for design and construction.  \n \nThe design effort for these parks will be bundled under a single contract to provide efficiency in costs, timing, community involvement, and coordination with other city departments.  In late 2021, a planned modification to this contract will be submitted to the Commission for final detailed design and bid documents. The UIRF funding identified for design and construction of these improvements currently stands at $987,035. Design is set to be completed by the end of 2021 with construction beginning in 2022.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on September 18, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on October 9, 2020.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nThe Mannik & Smith Group, Inc. (MAJ)                                          \nMKSK, Inc. (MAJ)\nBehnke and Associates (MAJ)\nEdge Group, Inc.

Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals, conducted short list interviews, and recommended EDGE Group, Inc. be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\n \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEDGE Group, Inc.                 \n330 West Spring Street, Suite 350, Columbus, OH  43215\nTedd Hardesty, (614) 486-3343                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 001500, 20-8054208\nMay 8, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the community engagement, program finalization, and project design can be completed by the end of 2021, allowing construction to be started in 2022.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: Franklinton is one of the city's most underserved communities for parks and active recreation. Providing small neighborhood-scale recreation spaces will improve community health and wellness. This is achieved through outdoor play, walking, social interaction, and a sense of neighborhood pride.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Public input was gathered through direct engagement at public meetings and person-to-person exchanges at the Franklinton Library in 2017 and 2018. A survey was also conducted and playgrounds, trees, open active space, walking paths, benches, and shelters were listed as the top park priorities. The project was discussed with the Franklinton Area Commission and Franklinton Board of Trade in 2018.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks and paths while offering easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages.\n \nFiscal Impact: $87,436.00 is budgeted and available from and within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with EDGE Group, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the parkland design for the West Franklinton Parks Improvements Project; to authorize the expenditure of $87,436.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
