    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with CESO Inc. for preliminary engineering services for the Hoover Reservoir Amenities Project. The contract amount is $41,230.00, with a contingency of $4,750.00, for a total of $45,980.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department manages three reservoirs across central Ohio, including Hoover Reservoir, O’Shaughnessy Reservoir, and Griggs Reservoir. The reservoirs provide countless recreational opportunities to several hundred-thousand Columbus residents per year, including boating, kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and more. Despite the wide range of activities each reservoir provides, all three reservoirs lack an ADA-compliant fishing dock. The Department is seeking to expand the accessibility of the reservoirs to all Columbus residents and is taking steps towards adding a fixed, ADA-compliant fishing dock at the Hoover Reservoir near the Goldsmith Drive parking lot. \n \nThe Goldsmith Drive location was chosen as the ADA-compliant dock location due to its low-traffic traffic conditions and proximity to the reservoir. Despite close proximity, anticipated challenges include minimizing impervious surface addition, satisfying ADA-grade for the sidewalk approach to the dock, and identifying successful limits for the dock to account for the seasonal surface water elevations.  In addition, whatever is proposed needs to be coordinated with the City’s Department of Public Utilities and other regulatory agencies for permitting.  For those reasons, preliminary engineering services will be performed by CESO Inc. to establish project scope for detailed design, identify necessary permits, and estimate final project cost for engineering and construction.\n \nThe Department also aims to maintain a high level of service for existing infrastructure at the reservoir. The two existing floating docks at the Walnut Street Boat Ramp are deteriorating structurally. Each floating dock is approximately 110-feet in length and is made of wooden decking over airtight drums. CESO Inc. will identify the scope of repairs needed for the dock abutments, as well as scope for replacing or repairing the docks themselves. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised to five pre-qualified architecture and engineering firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on October 27, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 10, 2020. Requests for proposals were sent to the following companies:\n \nCESO Inc., Inc. (MAJ)\nMannik & Smith (MAJ)\nDLZ (MBE)\nEnvironmental Design Group (MAJ)\nStone Environmental (FBE)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nOut of the five requests for proposals sent, only DLZ and CESO Inc. responded.  In accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended CESO Inc. be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nCESO Inc., Inc.\n2800 Corporate Exchange Drive, St. 400, Columbus                                                      \nJeff Tibbitts, tibbitts@cesoinc.vom, 614-942-3016                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 031591, 31-1229907\nDecember 10, 2021\n \nBenefits to the Public: The additional ADA-compliant fixed dock at Hoover Reservoir will be the first ADA-compliant dock at all three reservoirs locations in the city. The fixed dock expands the accessibility of the reservoirs to all Columbus residents. Repairing or replacing the existing Walnut Boat Ramp floating docks system will also increase user safety for the public accessing the Hoover Reservoir. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: With over 200 dock customers and thousands of public users, boaters on Hoover Reservoir have regularly requested repairs to the Walnut Street Launch Ramp.  There have been improvements to other ramps along Hoover Reservoir within the past ten years and the Walnut Street Ramp is noticeably in disrepair.  This ramp has the largest parking lot and serves the largest number of boaters. Most public input has been informal through phone calls and field conversations, but is a frequent topic with the community when discussing Hoover Reservoir.\n \nThere have also been recurring requests to Columbus Recreation and Parks, Public Utilities, and the City of Columbus ADA office to create accessible reservoir access. We have had first-hand experience witnessing people struggle on uneven terrain while hoping to enjoy the many recreational activities that Hoover offers.  Creating barrier free access to Hoover Reservoir will certainly be appreciated and heavily utilized by Hoover Reservoir’s widespread community.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99), Project location is outside of Columbus neighborhood boundaries but will serve all residents of Columbus \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by promoting the use of blueways. In addition, this project provides improved access for different types of watercraft, fishing, and wildlife viewing.\n \nFiscal Impact: $45,980.00 is budgeted and available from and within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with CESO, Inc. for preliminary engineering services for the Hoover Reservoir Amenities Project; to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of $45,980.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, and to authorize the expenditure of $45,980.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
