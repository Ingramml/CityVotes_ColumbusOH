    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to appropriate and spend $19,565.06 within the Public Safety Initiative subfund for the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Police, in order to allow the Division of Police to participate in a study led by the Ohio University Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Service, a part of the Appalachian Law Enforcement Initiative, that uses virtual reality to study police responses to various scenarios.     \n \nThe Ohio University study will take police officers through various law enforcement scenarios virtually and study reactions.  This program is designed for law enforcement to improve empathy and outcomes when working with the public. The funding will be used to support CPD's engagement in the study, which will survey law enforcement before and after the simulation to determine if attitudes change. \n \nThe larger Appalachian Law Enforcement Initiative brings together law enforcement officers, community stakeholders, and public administrators in a collaboration to reduce the use of force, teach de-escalation techniques, and improve law enforcement outcomes for both the community and police. This project helps to promote the mission of reimagining public safety by helping prepare law enforcement for difficult to navigate situations without the use of force. In addition, the program also promotes mindfulness for officers when it comes to communicating with the public, specifically with communities of color.  \n \nColumbus City Council is supporting CPD’s participation in this project with $19,565.06 from the Public Safety Initiative subfund.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Total appropriation is $19,565.06 and is available in the 2021 budget within the Public Safety Initiative subfund, Fund 1000-100016.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested in order to receive the funds in time to participate in the project. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $19,565.06 in the Public Safety Initiative subfund for the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Columbus Division of Police, to participate in the Appalachian Law Enforcement Virtual Reality Training Initiative; and to declare an emergency.
