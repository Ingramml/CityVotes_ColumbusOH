    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Resource International, Inc. for survey and design services for the Glenwood Park Improvements 2020 Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $23,446.00.\n \nGlenwood Park is a historic and iconic 16 acre community park serving as a gateway to the Greater Hilltop neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio. Approximately half of the park is forested and in need of park improvements as well as a survey of current conditions. There are vernal pools within the forest. There is also the potential that wetlands are within the forest. The forest has invasive shrubs, such as honeysuckle, that block visibility, leading to safety concerns while park visitors use the informal trails. For the past decade, community members have expressed interest in making the natural area of Glenwood Park more accessible.\n \nThe intent of this project is to provide the Recreation and Parks Department with options for potential designs of the 8 acre natural wooded area of Glenwood Park. The priorities being considered are a safe and open space that is accessible to the community, improved nature trails and opportunities for educational signage, increased visibility under mature trees, and a healthy functioning forest ecosystem that marries park use and natural environments. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were requested from pre-qualified architecture and engineering firms that were pre-qualified internally through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process outlined by Ordinance 2050-2020. Proposals were requested October 19, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on October 28, 2020.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nResource International, Inc. (WBE)\nDLZ Ohio, Inc. (MBE)\nEnvironmental Design Group (MAJ)\nGPD Group (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended Resource International, Inc. be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nResource International, Inc., Inc.\n6350 Presidential Gateway, Columbus, OH 43231\nMichelle Eckels, 614-797-9520\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004197, 31-0669793\nJanuary 23, 2022\n \nBenefits to the Public: Half of Glenwood Park, approximately 8 acres of hardwood forest, is not currently serving Columbus residents to the fullest extent possible. This project will allow the department to determine the appropriate improvements that could be made to the park.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Residents have requested Glenwood Park improvements through the Highland West Civic Association and the Greater Hilltop Area Commission. Representatives from those organizations have met monthly with the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department beginning in September 2020. The Greater Hilltop Area Commission compiled a list of recommendations for the park and those priorities were used to develop the Request for Proposals and select an appropriate vendor.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Greater Hilltop (53) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the city’s natural resources, improving the overall environmental health for current and future generations.\n \nFiscal Impact: $23,446.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Resource International, Inc. for survey and design services for the Glenwood Park Improvements 2020 Project; to authorize the amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of $23,446.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, and to authorize the expenditure of $23,446.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
