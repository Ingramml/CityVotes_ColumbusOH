    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract (UTC)/Purchase Agreement (PA) for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing. It also authorizes the appropriation of $2,000,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the special income tax fund to cover the majority of its cost.\n \nMicrosoft Office is the city’s technology standard for desktop computing software, currently used by approximately 7,500 city employees in their daily business. The city also uses Microsoft software to support a number of enterprise applications. Passage of this ordinance will enable the city to obtain the latest versions of Microsoft software utilizing a single agreement for the entire city.\n \nOn October 25th, 2020, the Department of Finance’s Purchasing Office published, RFQ016877 to solicit quotes for a new three-year Microsoft Enterprise Agreement UTC/PA. The five submissions received in response to the solicitation are as follows: Crayon Software Experts; Dell Marketing, LP; Insight Public Sector; SHI International; and Softchoice. Following a three-person committee evaluation, the submission of Dell Marketing, LP was deemed the most responsible, responsive, and best offer. As such, the Purchasing Office recommended that the UTC/PA be awarded to Dell Marketing, LP for a term of three years, expiring on December 31, 2023. (See attached Award Recommendation letter).\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $2,075,799.19 for the above-described service for a term of one year, starting on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2022. Of this total, $1,789,986.17 is for the annual renewal of the license and $285,813.02 is for the 2021 “true-up.” Two million dollars is allocated for this acquisition in the Special Income Tax Fund. The balance of  $75,799.19 is budgeted and available in the Information Services Operating Fund. The enterprise agreement enables the City to cancel without penalty in the event that funds are not appropriated to pay for future annual terms.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance appropriates $2,000,000.00 in Special Income Tax funds to DoT to fund a portion of the annual Microsoft Enterprise Agreement and “true-up” costs. The balance of $75,799.19 is budgeted and available in the Information Services Operating Fund.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to ensure that a purchase order is established by the City Auditor’s year-end deadline, thus ensuring that payment on the new licenses can be made by the supplier’s stated deadline at the price offered.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nDell Marketing LP, CC#74-2616805, expires 8/30/2023\nDAX #010030 \n \nTitle\nTo appropriate $2,000,000.00 within the Special Income Tax Fund; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract/ Purchase Agreement for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing; to authorize the expenditure of $2,000,000.00 from the Special Income Tax Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $75,799.19 from the Information Services Operating Fund and to declare an emergency.
