    "description": "Explanation\nIt is anticipated that there will be 75,000 individuals nationwide who are in need of assistance.  Columbus is currently committed to assisting approximately 350 people. Finding housing will be the primary challenge. We, like many other cities throughout the country, will need to do our part to provide relief to address the extraordinary, unique humanitarian crisis, and this is why City Council is establishing the Afghan Neighbors Rental Assistance Fund. (ANRAF).\n \nOur city will be playing a vital role in providing shelter to Afghan evacuees who have come to the United States as part of Operation Allies Welcome.  As of September 30, 2021, Columbus has started to welcome Afghan nationals who have completed extensive background checks and processing at the military bases as part of the Afghan Placement Assistance Program (APA), a newly established program by the U.S. Department of State.\n \nColumbus City Council will support the establishment of the Afghan Neighbors Rental Assistance Fund program with $50,000.00. The funding will be divided equally between Community Refugee & Immigration Services (CRIS) and US Together. The funding is intended to support housing costs only, i.e. rent expenses. The funding will be limited to one-time assistance per family in an amount up to the lesser of 6 months’ rent or $5,000 in total, and beneficiaries will need to demonstrate need based upon unemployment, underemployment, or other financial hardship. As the program continues, we will continue to assess funding needs and adjust accordingly.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to ensure that Community Refugee & Immigration Services and US Together can immediately begin providing rental assistance.\n \nFiscal Impact: Total appropriation is $50,000.00 and is available in the Neighborhood Initiative subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements with Community Refugee & Immigration Services and with US Together in support of the Afghan Neighbors Rental Assistance Fund; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
