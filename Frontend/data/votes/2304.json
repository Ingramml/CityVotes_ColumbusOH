    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The need exists to amend and restate the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement (“AGREEMENT”) between the City of Columbus (“CITY”) and Upstart Network, Inc. (“GRANTEE”).  Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 1187-2019, passed on May 13, 2019, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an AGREEMENT with the GRANTEE for an annual cash payment equal to (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees and (ii) thirty percent (30%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of those employees who are also City of Columbus residents at the end of each calendar year, for a term up to five (5) years.  The GRANTEE proposed a total project investment of approximately $1.4 million, which included $100,000 in technology, $200,000 in machinery and equipment, $100,000 in furniture and fixtures, and $1,000,000 in leasehold improvements to lease office space at 711 N. High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, parcel number 010-031749 and 886 N. High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, parcel number 010-007464 (collectively, and hereinafter referred to as the “PROJECT SITE”).  Additionally, the GRANTEE committed to create 100 net new full-time permanent positions with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $10,750,000 at the proposed PROJECT SITE.  The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective March 4, 2020.\n \nIn a letter received by the CITY from the GRANTEE dated July 9, 2020, and through additional correspondence, the GRANTEE confirmed that TriNet Group, Inc., dba TriNet (“TriNet”), a third party employer recognized as a Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”), will be the employer of record for some of the new employees hired at the PROJECT SITE.  Additionally, in a letter from TriNet, dated October 19, 2020 validated that the company will serve as the GRANTEE’s employer of record.  Also, the GRANTEE planned to expand their original commitment by entering into a lease extension on a vacant office space consisting of approximately 54,870 square feet at 800 N. High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 parcel number 010-300582.  As a result of this expansion, the GRANTEE is requesting the AGREEMENT be amended to add the company’s third party employer TriNet as an additional GRANTEE to the AGREEMENT, amend and revise the proposed project scope, add 800 N. High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 parcel number 010-300582 as an additional location to the PROJECT SITE, and to extend the incentive term one (1) additional year as offered in a letter from the CITY dated October 29, 2020, and accepted by the GRANTEE in a letter dated November 30, 2020.  \n \nTherefore, there is a need to amend the AGREEMENT for the purpose of (1) to add TriNet Group, Inc. dba TriNet as an additional grantee and third party employer to the AGREEMENT, (2) to amend and revise the proposed job creation goal from 100 new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $10.75 million to 350 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $23,389,500, (3) to revise the incentive term of the AGREEMENT from five (5) consecutive years to six (6) consecutive years, (4) to add 800 N. High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 parcel number 010-300582 as an additional location to the PROJECT SITE, and (5) as the AGREEMENT will be amended and restated, the amended and restated AGREEMENT will be based on the current “JGI Agreement September 2021” template.)\n \nThe legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend and restate the AGREEMENT for the purpose of (1) to add TriNet Group, Inc. dba TriNet as additional grantee to the AGREEMENT, (2) to revise the proposed job creation goal from 100 net new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $10.75 million to 350 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $23,389,500, (3) to revise the incentive term of the AGREEMENT from five (5) consecutive years to six (6) consecutive years, (4) to add 800 N. High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, parcel number 010-300582 as an additional location to the PROJECT SITE, and (5) that the amended and restated agreement would follow the full format of the City’s current City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement.\n \nThis legislation is being presented as an emergency measure to amend and restate the AGREEMENT in as expedient a manner as possible so that this amendment to the AGREEMENT can be executed and ensure that GRANTEE receive any future tax benefits from the approved tax incentive.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend and restate the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with Upstart Network, Inc. for the purposes of: to add TriNet Group, Inc., dba TriNet as additional grantee to the AGREEMENT; to revise the proposed job creation goal from 100 new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $10.75 million to 350 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $23,389,500; to revise the incentive term of the AGREEMENT from five consecutive years to six consecutive years; to add 800 N.
