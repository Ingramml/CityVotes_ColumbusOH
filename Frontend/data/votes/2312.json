    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize and Congratulate Brian Goodson for receiving the 2021 Donald R. Hallman LGBTQ Veterans Recognition Award\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Brian Goodson is a 10-year veteran of the United States Air Force serving as a Cook, stationed primarily at Ramstein in Germany; and\n \nWHEREAS, As leader of the Columbus chapter of Team Red, White, and Blue (RWB), Brian has planned, organized, and executed hundreds, if not thousands, of physical and social activities that have had significant positive influence on thousands of veterans.

He is a strong advocate for the LGBTQ members of the organization; and\n \nWHEREAS, Brian has carried our Nation’s flag in hundreds of races, from local 5K events to the US Service Branch marathons (USMC Marathon, USAF Marathon), to numerous ultra-marathons across the country; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  \n \nThat this Council does hereby express its appreciation for Brian Goodson for his service to this country and the LGBTQ and veterans community in Columbus. This Council does hereby congratulate him on receiving the 2021 Donald R. Hallman LGBTQ Veterans Recognition Award from Stonewall Columbus.",
