Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2020 - 2022 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 0130-2020.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2020-2022) time frame.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of Modification No. 9 was determined by negotiations between Stantec Consulting Services Inc. and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \n2.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  The use of more sustainable, and environmentally friendly systems, commonly referred to as “green” infrastructure, has been recognized and implemented in many communities as a potential solution to many of the elements associated with EPA consent order requirements.  Green infrastructure also provides additional stormwater treatment benefits, as well as potentially mitigating street flooding and impacts to receiving streams.  \n \nThe construction of green infrastructure will have an impact on the local economy by creating the need for personnel to construct and maintain the proposed facilities, as well as obtaining project related materials from local suppliers and vendors.\n \nAn additional benefit of these projects is the possible re-purposing of Columbus Land Redevelopment Office (Land Bank), abandoned, and vacant parcels for the implementation of Green Infrastructure (GI). The City wishes to explore viable GI and low-impact development (LID) technologies which could be constructed on these vacant or abandoned parcels/lots within the project area to achieve a stormwater benefit.\n \nThe majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues.\n \n \n3.0 FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  The Department anticipates requesting additional future modifications to this contract as new construction projects begin during 2021 and 2022. \n \n4.0 CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: 11-2167170 | Exp. 7/28/23 | MAJ | DAX #000462\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Stantec Consulting Services.\n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the transfer and expenditure of up to $800,000 within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Fund 6109.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to execute a planned modification of the 2020-2022 Construction Administration and Inspection Services Agreement with Stantec Consulting Services for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage’s Blueprint Hilltop-Miller/Kelton Professional Construction Management Services Project;
