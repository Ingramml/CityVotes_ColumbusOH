    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to decrease the imprest petty cash fund for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Compost Facility from $650 to $325.\n \nThe Division of Water is to be decreased for the following areas:\n \nAdministration - From $1,900.00 to $1,500.00\nField Services - from $400.00 to $0.00\nParsons Avenue Water Treatment Plant - from $200.00 to $0.00\n \nThe Revenue Reception Office section funds utilized by the cashiers were initially provided for by the Division of Water.  Now that this section has been transferred under the Department of Public Utilities, Director’s Office, the funds should be provided via a 4 way-split.  This ordinance will authorize the City Auditor to process the necessary journal entries to reduce the Division of Water’s portion and to establish the balance of the funding from the Division of Sewerage and Drainage Sanitary Operating Fund, Storm Sewer Operating Fund and the Division of Power Electricity Operating Fund as follows:\n \nDivision of Water Operating Fund - Reduce from $1,500.00 to $582.00\nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage Sanitary Operating Fund - Increase by $652.50\nDivision of Power Electricity Operating Fund - Increase by $91.50\nStorm Sewer Operating Fund - Increase by $174.00\n \nThe Sewer Permit Section Petty Cash funds were initially provided for by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.  Now that this section has been transferred under the Department of Public Utilities, Director’s Office, the funds should be provided via a 4 way-split.  These funds are utilized for making change when someone purchases a spec book, which could be for any of the projects within the various divisions of the Department of Public Utilities.  This ordinance will authorize the City Auditor to process the necessary journal entries to reduce the Division of Sewerage and Drainage’s portion and to establish the balance of the funding from the Division of Water Operating Fund, Storm Sewer Operating Fund and the Division of Power Electricity Operating Fund as follows:\n \nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage Sanitary Operating Fund - Reduce from $50.00 to $21.75\nDivision of Water Operating Fund - Increase by $19.40\nDivision of Power Electricity Operating Fund - Increase by $3.05\nStorm Sewer Operating Fund - Increase by $5.80\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities Director’s Office Petty Cash totals $700.00.  Of this amount $100.00 was originally established with Ordinance #1818-84 from the General Fund (60-00, Subfund 01-100, Index Code #600007) for the Director’s Office and at a later time, an additional $600 was established using the Director’s Office 4-way split funding.  To maintain consistency this ordinance will authorize the City Auditor to process the necessary journal entries to move the funding of the $100.00 from the General Fund, to also be provided via the 4-way split funding.\n \n \nThe new imprest petty cash fund totals will be as follows:\n \nFund Name                                          Petty

emergency action, no less than thirty-seven days will be added to the process.  The Department would like to have all of these changes made prior to the close of the books for the year 2021.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to make the necessary accounting changes to revise the funding sources as is necessary to provide for the increases and decreases within the
