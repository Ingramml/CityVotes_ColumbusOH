    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $75,000.00 of the 2020 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio for the construction of a single family home.\n \nHabitat for Humanity MidOhio (HFHMO) proposes to build one new single-family home in the City of Columbus at 1344 E 15th Avenue. The home will be built to AWARE standards and is designed to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood. It will be a single story home with a front porch and no garage and built on vacant property purchased from COCIC. \n \nThe first-time homebuyer identified for this home is a single mother with two children. She earns below 80% of the Area Median Income.\n \nHFHMO has a 34 year history of creating safe, decent, affordable homeownership opportunities for low-and very-low-income families.  An affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, HFHMO has built, repaired, or rehabilitated more than 600 homes throughout their service area of Franklin, Madison, and Licking Counties. Their homes are typically sold to first-time homebuyers earning 30%-60% of the Area Median Income who are willing to partner with them by completing a homeownership education course and up to 200 hours of sweat equity work on their own home, as well as other Habitat homes. \n \nA unique aspect of the Habitat model is that they offer no-interest, no-profit mortgages to their buyers, making the homes affordable to families who would not qualify for traditional mortgages.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the developer to maintain the project schedule.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 004859 and expires 4/13/2023.\n \nFiscal Impact: $75,000.00 is available from the 2020 HOME grant (G451903).\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $75,000.00 of 2020 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio in an amount up to $75,000.00 for 1344 E 15th Avenue; and to declare an emergency. ($75,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is a participating jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is the recipient of HOME Investment Partnerships funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus City Council has approved the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020, as required by HUD; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development desires to support Habitat for Humanity MidOhio with financial support for one single family home project at 1344 E 15th Avenue; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio and to appropriate and expend said funds to allow for the developer to maintain the project schedule, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
