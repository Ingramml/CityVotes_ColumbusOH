The CITY advised the TIRC that it was not amenable to amending the AGREEMENT, with the TIRC then recommending that the AGREEMENT be dissolved and that ENTERPRISE should come back to the CITY when they are ready to undertake the project.\n \nCOUNCIL, by Resolution 0145X-2021, passed September 20, 2021, accepted the written recommendations presented by the 2021 TIRC.\n \nThis legislation is presented as an emergency measure in order for this dissolution to be legislated in the most expedient manner as possible so that this dissolution of the AGREEMENT can be reported to the necessary local and state agencies prior to the end of calendar year 2021.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo dissolve the Enterprise Zone Agreement with 93 OHRPT, LLC;
