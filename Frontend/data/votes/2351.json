    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 1648-2019, passed July 1, 2019, authorized the City of Columbus (“CITY”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Mission XC, LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), for a real property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed $6.5 million investment in real property improvements and the creation of 10 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $353,600 related to the construction of a new approximately 136,315 square foot speculative industrial building located at 1302 London Groveport Road on Parcel Number 495-232636 within the City of Columbus and within the Columbus Central Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”).  The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective December 3, 2019 with the abatement to commence no later than 2021 nor extend beyond 2030 (Agreement No. 023-19-15).  All real property improvements were expected to have been completed by December 2020.  It should be noted that this ENTERPRISE has also been known as Mission XC, LLC II (1302 London Groveport Road).  Subsequent to this but prior to this legislation, the parent parcel 495-232636 was split to create in part Parcel Number 495-300546 with the street address to remain 1302 London Groveport Road (per the Franklin County Auditor) which revised the PROJECT SITE.  As of this date there has not been a filing of the DTE-24 with the Franklin County Auditor, no Final Determination from the Ohio Department of Taxation, and so no forgone tax benefit has yet been received.\n \nParagraph thirteen within Section 6 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY.”\n \nIn a letter received by the City from ENTERPRISE dated June 9, 2021, ENTERPRISE advised the CITY that “the Project was conveyed to The Hub XO, LLC” and that “The Hub XO, LLC is an affiliate of Mission XC” and that “the ultimate parent entity of Mission XC and the The Hub XO, LLC is Xebec Holdings, LLC.”  ENTERPRISE also provided the CITY with a copy of the recorded Limited Warranty Deed evidencing the conveyance of the Project from Mission XC to The Hub XO, LLC.  The letter concluded with the request that “the City please approve an assignment of the Agreement” from Mission XC, LLC to The Hub XO, LLC.\n \nAdditionally, Columbus City Council, by Ordinance No. 3221-2018, passed March 13, 2019, authorized the Director of Development to establish a fee schedule that supports the Department’s administrative and project costs associated with administering Department programs with one of those fees being an Amendment Fee.\n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to remove Mission XC, LLC as ENTERPRISE to be replaced by The Hub XO, LLC as ENTERPRISE whereby The Hub XO, LLC assumes the terms and commitments of the AGREEMENT as ENTERPRISE, to revise the description of the PROJECT SITE and to add language requiring an Amendment Fee for future Grantee-initiated Amendments.\n \nThis legislation is presented as an emergency measure in order for this amendment to be legislated prior to the start of the report year 2021 reporting cycle and that this amendment to the AGREEMENT can be reported to the necessary local and state agencies in as expedient manner as possible to ensure that ENTERPRISE remains in compliance with the terms of the AGREEMENT.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to remove Mission XC, LLC, also known as Mission XC, LLC II (1302 London Groveport Road), as ENTERPRISE to be replaced by The Hub XO, LLC as ENTERPRISE whereby The Hub XO, LLC will assume the terms and commitments of the AGREEMENT as ENTERPRISE, to revise the description of the PROJECT SITE and to add language requiring an Amendment Fee for future Grantee-initiated Amendments and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS,                     the City of Columbus (“CITY”) entered into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Mission XC, LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), approved by Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”) by Ordinance No. 1648-2019, passed July 1, 2019, with this AGREEMENT made and entered into effective December 3, 2019;
