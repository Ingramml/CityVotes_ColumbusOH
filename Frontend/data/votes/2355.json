    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:                     City Council passed Ordinance No. 1799-2010 on December 13, 2010 (the “TIF Ordinance”) creating the Weinland Park Incentive District .40(C) TIF, requiring the deposit of service payments generated by parcels subject to the TIF Ordinance (the “Service Payments”) into a special TIF fund, and designating authorized public improvements to be financed by those Service Payments. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 0205-2012 passed by City Council on February 6, 2012, the City entered into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement with Weinland Park Development, LLC (the “Developer”) dated as of April 17, 2013 (the “Prior TIF Agreement”) with respect to parcels subject to the TIF Ordinance in order to reimburse the Developer for its costs of certain public improvements benefiting or serving the development of the Weinland Park Incentive District from the Service Payments. The Weinland Park Incentive District and surrounding neighborhoods have experienced new growth and development since the passage of the TIF Ordinance, and the area now needs more public parking to allow the public to access the residences, businesses, and public facilities in the area. The Developer is now proposing to construct a ninety-eight million dollar ($98,000,000) 311-unit apartment complex and a 557-space structured parking facility (the “Project”) with approximately 189 public spaces (the “Public Spaces”) on approximately ±3.445 acres of real property known as Franklin County Auditor Tax Parcel ID No. 010-024540 owned by an affiliate of the Developer and located to the northeast corner of N. 4th Street and E. 5th Avenue. The Department of Development has submitted for Council’s consideration Ordinance 2918-2021 to amend the TIF Ordinance to add parking facilities to the list of public infrastructure improvements that may be financed with Service Payments. This Ordinance approves and authorizes a new Cooperative Agreement and First Amendment to Tax Increment Financing Agreement by and among the City, the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (the “CFCFA”) and the Developer (the “Cooperative Agreement and First Amendment”) pursuant to which the CFCFA will issue bonds to finance the Public Spaces; the City will pledge Service Payments to repay those bonds, with such pledge superior in priority to any reimbursement pursuant to the Prior TIF Agreement. This Ordinance will also appropriate and authorize the expenditure of the Service Payments pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement and First Amendment and authorize the Director of Development to execute a Declaration of public parking garage covenants to secure public use of the Public Spaces for 30 years. \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is necessary to allow the Developer to maintain its project schedule and allow for the timely sale of bonds to finance the public spaces.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation. The City is appropriating and authorizing the expenditure of service payments generated by the parcels in the Weinland Park Incentive District .40(C) TIF subject to the TIF Ordinance that are deposited or to be deposited in the Weinland Park .40(C) Municipal Public Improvement Tax Increment Equivalent Fund all in accordance with the Cooperative Agreement and First Amendment to Tax Increment Financing Agreement.\n \nTitle\nTo appropriate and authorize the expenditure of service payments generated by the parcels subject to the Weinland Park.40(C) TIF and deposited in the Weinland Park .40(C) Municipal Public Improvement Tax Increment Equivalent Fund pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement and First Amendment to Tax Increment Financing Agreement; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute and deliver a Cooperative Agreement and First Amendment to Tax Increment Financing Agreement by and among the City of Columbus, the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and Weinland Park Development, LLC for the financing of public parking spaces in Weinland Park Development, LLC’s new garage near N. 4th St. and E. 5th Ave.;
