    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND AND FISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAs part of the 2021 third quarter financial review, the Department of Finance and Management identified surpluses and deficits in various object classes in several divisions.  In order to properly align appropriations with projected expenditures and allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2021, it is necessary to transfer $19,038,000.00 among divisions within the general fund, to transfer $771,000 in cash from the general fund to the property management fund, and to authorize a supplemental appropriation in the property management fund.\n \nObject class surpluses and deficits were projected as part of the third quarter financial review.  This ordinance makes transfers to reflect these projections.   The amounts may not mirror the third quarter review exactly due to transfers that have occurred in the interim as well as adjustments made in projections since the completion of the review.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes appropriation transfers and additional appropriations for certain non-general fund departments and divisions in order to provide appropriations in the necessary object classes for the remainder of the fiscal year. \n \nLastly, additional appropriation is necessary from the collection of all fines, fees, and from other sources of revenue in the recreation and parks operating fund and the development services fund, to properly align appropriations with projected expenditures. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow these financial transactions to be posted in the city's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to provide for the transfer of $19,038,000.00 within the general fund; to authorize the transfer of cash in the amount of $771,000.00 from the general fund to the property management fund; to transfer appropriations between objects in certain non-general fund departments and divisions; to authorize and direct the City Auditor to appropriate additional funds in the recreation and parks operating fund, the development services fund, and the property management fund; and to declare an emergency ($19,038,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the third quarter financial review, conducted by the Department of Finance and Management, identified projected surpluses and deficits in various object classes of several general fund and non-general fund divisions; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer funds between objects and divisions in order to allow divisions to continue to operate through the end of 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, a transfer of cash and additional appropriations are necessary in the property management fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, additional appropriations are necessary in the recreation and parks operating fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, additional appropriations are necessary in the development services operating fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transactions to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible, promoting accurate accounting and financial management; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Auditor to transfer funds, and make additional appropriations for the immediate preservation of the public,
