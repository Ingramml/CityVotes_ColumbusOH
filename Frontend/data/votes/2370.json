    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Trane U.S., Inc. for the replacement of a direct digital heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control system at the Division of Fleet Management located at 4211 Groves Road. \nThe existing HVAC control system at the Division of Fleet is beyond its useful life and as such, the control infrastructure has become obsolete and in need of replacement. This system controls the functioning of the HVAC system, such as airflow, cooling and heating at the Division of Fleet.\n \nA waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes, Section 329 is requested to ensure that a replacement control system matches the existing HVAC equipment. The existing HVAC system is composed of both Trane controls and equipment. In order for an HVAC system to work optimally, the control system and the equipment must be appropriately calibrated and integrated. Replacing the existing Trane control system with a new Trane control system, will ensure that the overall HVAC system works as a single, properly integrated network. In addition to compatibility, Trane U.S., Inc. also currently has the necessary control system readily available and is able to incorporate these controls into the HVAC system prior to winter. This holistic integration will ensure smooth, efficient, and cost effective HVAC operations.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that a new HVAC control system can be installed as soon as possible, thus ensuring the proper operation of the Division of Fleet's HVAC system.\nThe contract compliance number for Trane U.S. Inc. is 25-0900465 and it expires on May 10, 2023.\nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $400,000.00 from the Fleet Management Capital Fund with Trane U.S., Inc. for the replacement of direct digital HVAC controls at the Division of Fleet at 4211 Groves Road. The base proposal equals $342,000.00 with a construction contingency of $58,000.00.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Trane U.S., Inc. for the replacement of direct digital HVAC controls at the Division of Fleet; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds between projects within the Fleet Management Capital Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $400,000.00 from the Fleet Management Capital Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329; and to declare an emergency.
