The lengthy process for initiating a new procurement, and for a new entity to gain understanding of the project, would likely cause an unacceptable project delay and additional cost.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined through scope and fee negotiation with the design professional.\n \n2.   Project Timeline:  The Professional Engineering Services Agreement was executed on June 20, 2016 and provided Step 1, Preliminary Design Services, and Step 2, Detailed Design and Bidding Services. The Step 1, Preliminary Design Services, was completed on January 12, 2017 and Step 2, Detailed Design and Bidding Services was completed on October 1, 2018. Modification No. 1 was executed on September 13, 2019 and the design was completed in April of 2020. Modification No. 2 was executed on November 30, 2020 with design completed on July 15, 2021. Construction bids were received on October 13, 2021 and it is anticipated that the Notice to Proceed for construction and for Step 3 - Engineering Services During Construction will be in the first quarter of 2022. The Professional Engineering Services Contract will continue 90 days beyond completion of construction to provide “as-built” record drawings of the constructed facilities.\n \n3.   Contract Compliance No.:  94-1446346 | MAJ | Exp.  10/12/2023 | Vendor # 010815\n \n4.  Economic / Environment Impact:   SWWTP Digestion Process Expansion project will increase the beneficial re-use of biosolids in the liquid land application and deep row hybrid popular (DRHP) programs by providing more anaerobically-digested Class B biosolids.
