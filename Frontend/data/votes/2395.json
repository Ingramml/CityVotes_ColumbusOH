    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The need exists to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with Wilson Twin Creek Partners LLC. The Ohio Enterprise Zone law Section 5709.62(C) of the Ohio Revised Code requires the City to enter into Council-approved agreements between the City and participating companies.\n \nWilson Twin Creek Partners LLC is a partnership that is comprised of members of Tenby Partners who will serve as the sponsor entity that invests directly in and oversees the development of the project. Tenby Partners, established in 2005, is one of the larger local real estate development firms in the Columbus region. Over the past decade, Tenby Partners has successfully completed over 500 major projects nationwide. Wilson Twin Creek Partners LLC will be the owner of the project.\n \nThe project represents a massive private investment in an area of the City lacking in Class A flex office space.
