    "description": "Title\nTo honor, recognize and celebrate Santino’s Crusades for a Cancer-Free World for its continued advocacy, dedication, and contributions to cancer research.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS; Santino Carnevale has found himself within the cancer world the entirety of his life. In March 2006, just 10 days after Santino’s parents, Michael and Brooke Carnevale, discovered they were expecting a child, his father was diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma-a rare head and neck cancer.\n \nWHEREAS; In 2015, at 9 years of age, Santino Carnevale made the decision to stand up and do something in the fight against cancer. At such a young age, he already possessed a desire to help others by raising awareness and funds for head and neck cancers. Santino began by organizing a lemonade stand and bake sale.\n \nWHEREAS; The first year of the lemonade stand, Santino’s efforts raised an astounding $5,000 and he has never looked back. Santino formed his initiative known as “Santino’s Crusade for a Cancer-Free World”.\n \nWHEREAS; Santino Carnevale has raised roughly $130,000 over the past five years, with more than $100,000 donated to The James Cancer Hospital. \n \nWHEREAS; Santino is widely known throughout The James as one of the youngest adolescents to establish a fund and is often referred to as “Santino, the Cancer Crusader!” Santino created the Head and Neck Cancer Strategic Support Fund at The OSUCCC-James in his beloved father’s honor in 2015. \n \nWHEREAS; Santino also serves as a member of the James Ambassadors Society at The OSUCCC-James and is the youngest member inducted into the Society. He is an inspiration to all at The James Cancer Hospital and an invaluable member of the Central Ohio community; now, therefore.\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: To honor, recognize and celebrate Santino’s Crusades for a Cancer-Free World for its continued advocacy, dedication, and contributions to cancer research at The Ohio State University James Cancer Center.",
