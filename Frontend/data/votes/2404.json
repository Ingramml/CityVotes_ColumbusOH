    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize and Honor the service of Councilmember Mitchell J. Brown to the City of Columbus\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Councilmember Mitchell J. Brown was selected as a member of Columbus City Council in January of 2016, and following his reelection in November of 2019, he has served residents of Columbus on City Council for six years; and\n \nWHEREAS, During his time on Columbus City Council Mitchell Brown served as chairman of the Public Safety, Veterans, and Senior Affairs Committee, dedicating himself to ensuring every Columbus resident had a safe, clean neighborhood to call home; and\n \nWHEREAS, Councilmember Brown invested in enhancements to Columbus's public safety response. For the Division of Police, he focused on transparency, accountability, and community engagement; ensuring the body-worn camera program, Safe Streets Initiative, and Narcan distribution received the funding it needed to be successful; and                      \n  \nWHEREAS, Councilmember Brown invested in life-saving innovations for the Division of Fire, including dedicated vehicles for the Rapid Response Emergency Addiction and Crisis Team (RREACT), the launch of the Mobile Stroke Treatment Unit, and additional resources to increase efforts around prevention through gun lock distribution and community instruction on Hands-only CPR; and                      \n \nWHEREAS, As a veteran of the United States Air Force and a senior, Councilmember Brown was intimately aware of the challenges facing our community's seniors and veterans.

Brown's leadership centered on kindness and collaboration. As a strong proponent of the Columbus Way, Councilmember Brown subscribes to the philosophy the managers do things right, while leaders do the right thing; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby recognize and honor the service of Councilmember Mitchell J. Brown",
