    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan combines into a single submission the planning and application aspects of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs.  This plan represents a continuing commitment to provide decent housing, suitable living environments and expanded economic opportunities over the five-year period.

The Fiscal Year 2022 allocations are expected to be announced in late winter or early spring 2022.\n30-DAY LEGISLATION: The City intends to publish a notice of 30-day public comment period on the FY 2022 Annual Action Plan as detailed and required in the Citizen Participation Plan within the five-year Consolidated Plan.  The 30-day public comment period should overlap with the 30-day legislative period of this legislation.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  The City expects to receive approximately $13 million in grant awards for the four programs listed above.  The Grants Management Section will submit future legislation to accept grant awards and authorize both the appropriation and expenditure of those funds.\nTitle\nTo adopt the FY 2022 Annual Action Plan which implements the third year of the five-year Consolidated Plan for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs; and to authorize the filing of the Annual Action Plan with the U.
