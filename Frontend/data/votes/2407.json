($377,000.00)",
    "description": "EXPLANATION\n \nBACKGROUND: The Finance and Management Department, Office of Construction Management, employs personnel that are engaged in overseeing various construction and building renovation capital projects for the City.  The staffing costs for the Office of Construction Management are initially expensed to the general fund; however, the portion related to managing capital projects is eligible to be capitalized.  Doing so is consistent with earlier efforts by the Office of Construction Management to reimburse the general fund when the general fund has incurred expenses more appropriate to capital improvement funding.  Most recently, Ordinance 1955-2021, authorized $305,700.00 for this purpose.  The Office of Construction Management tracks the hours each employee works on individual projects and bills these hours to the associated capital project. This process reimburses the general fund for the portion of staff time attributable to capital projects.  \n \nEmergency action is requested so that reimbursement to the general fund can occur as quickly as possible. Up-to-date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to encumber $327,000.00 within the Construction Management Capital Improvement Fund and $50,000.00 within the Public Safety Capital Fund for the purpose of Office of Construction Management staffing costs.  This ordinance also authorizes transfers within the Safety GO Bonds Fund, and the General Permanent Improvement Fund to align budget authority with actual expenditures.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize transfers within the Construction Management Capital Improvement Fund, the Safety GO Bonds Fund, and the General Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $327,000.00 from the Construction Management Capital Improvement Fund and $50,000.00 from the Public Safety Capital Improvement Fund, in order to reimburse the general fund for construction and building renovation expenses incurred by the Office of Construction Management; and to declare an emergency. ($377,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Office of Construction Management employs personnel engaged in construction and building renovation activities and these costs can be capitalized; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize this expenditure in order to provide adequate operating resources for the Office of Construction Management; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize various transfers within the Safety GO Bonds Fund, and the General Permanent Improvement Fund to align budget authority with expenditures; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget to provide sufficient authority for these transactions; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $377,000.00, $327,000 from the Construction Management Capital Improvement fund and $50,000.00 from the Public Safety Capital Improvement Fund, to reimburse the general fund for construction and building renovation expenses, and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Finance and Management Department, Office of Construction Management, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to reimburse the general fund, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding sources for all contracts or contract modifications associated with the ordinance. \n \nSECTION 7. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project. \n \nSECTION 8.
