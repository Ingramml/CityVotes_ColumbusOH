    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nIn 2018, the City of Columbus instituted mandatory direct deposit for its employees.  At the same time, in order to offer an alternative to employees who were unwilling or unable to provide banking information, the Columbus City Treasurer’s Office entered into contract for two years with US Bank for payroll cards at no cost to the City.  In 2020, the City Treasurer’s Office entered into a second contract with US Bank for payroll cards for its employees, again, at no cost to the City.\n \nWith passage of ordinance number 1821-2021 on July 12, 2021, Columbus City Council authorized the City Treasurer's Office to modify its contract with US Bank to provide gift cards for Columbus Public Health for it to offer gift cards as an incentive for those that receive a vaccine at a CPH COVID-19 vaccination site.\n \nDue to the strength of community adoption, Columbus Public Health extended its incentive program for six additional weeks with additional resources provided by American Rescue Plan funding.  Columbus Public Health requested and Mayor Andrew J. Ginther provided authorization in an Emergency Letter dated August 10, 2021.  Columbus City Council authorized another modification of the City Treasurer’s Office contract with US Bank to provide additional gift cards for Columbus Public Health with passage of ordinance 2188-2021 on September 13, 2021.\n \nThe Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, had a project in collaboration with the Division of Fire for community event on October 23, 2021 to compensate individuals who voluntarily surrendered firearms with a gift card.  Contraband Seizure Funds were authorized for this project.  Columbus City Council authorized this contract modification and expenditures with US Bank with passage of ordinance 2579-2021 on October 11, 2021.\n \nOn November 18, 2021 Columbus Public Health again requested and Mayor Andrew J. Ginther provided authorization in an Emergency Letter to extend its incentive program through the end of 2021.  The additional funding of $420,000 will be provided by American Rescue Plan dollars.\n \nThe Treasurer’s Office now wishes to modify its contract with US Bank in order to facilitate the use of gift cards for this purpose.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to the signed Mayor's Emergency Letter to continue the Columbus \nPublic Health COVID-19 vaccine incentive program. \nContract Compliance:  US Bank National Association 310841368 expiration January 30, 2022. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to modify its contract with US Bank, NA for gift cards for the Columbus Public Health; to authorize the expenditure of up to $420,000.00 from fund 2209; and to declare an emergency. ($420,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health, pursuant to a Mayor's Emergency Letter - Vaccine Incentive \nProgram date November 18, 2021, has extended its program to continue the COVID-19 vaccine incentive \nwith funding from the American Rescue Plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer’s Office has a contract with US Bank for payroll cards; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Treasurer now wishes to modify its contract with US Bank and authorize the \nrelated expenditures to provide gift cards for Columbus Public Health; \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Treasurer to modify its contract with US Bank and to authorize the expenditure as cited below, so that Columbus Public Health may prevent, prepare for, and respond to a public health emergency in central Ohio and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
