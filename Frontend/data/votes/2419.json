    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to execute Contract Modification No. 16 to the Organic Waste Processing Agreement between the City of Columbus (City), Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC (Kurtz) and the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO).\n \nThis Modification No. 16 will fund the following provisions and services to this contract.  Modification No. 16 will be in effect from December 1, 2021 to and including November 30, 2022.  The contract includes:\n \nA. Trucked Waste Disposal Facility:\nGrant Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC the authority to design their facility to include the process of accepting trucked waste in addition to the fats, oils and grease (FOG) that they will be accepting under the terms of the original agreement. In so much as Kurtz was constructing a similar facility to the one operated by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) in the vicinity of Berliner Park, both parties agreed that it would be in their best interests to share a facility to accommodate both efforts, thereby reducing costs and a duplication of services. This facility will be operated and maintained by Kurtz under the terms of this agreement. Per mutual agreement of the parties, this service ceased on November 30, 2018. The facility was relocated and the City assumed the responsibility previously performed by Kurtz on November 30, 2018.\n \nB. Incinerator Ash Beneficial Reuse Program:\nGrant Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC the authority to finalize a beneficial reuse program for wastewater treatment incinerator ash that was generated by the City’s two wastewater treatment plants. Ash had been historically stored at the treatment plants in lagoons and land filled at considerable expense to DOSD. This program had allowed for up to 5,000 tons of wastewater treatment incinerator ash a year to be removed and adapted for beneficial reuse under this provision, at a rate of $30.97 per ton, which was less than the land filing cost to the City. In 2015, the CITY ceased incineration of sewerage sludge, and incinerator ash is no longer generated at the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Facility or the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Facility. \n \nC. Fixed Rate Sewerage Sludge Processing Term:\nContinue a fixed rate fee of $33.50 per wet ton of sewerage sludge processing for the duration of this contract (10 + 5 year extension). This contract authorizes the transfer to the Organic Waste Recovery and Reuse System of up to 25,000 wet tons of sewerage sludge per year at this rate. This contract provides DOSD with an additional beneficial alternative use option for sewerage sludge.\n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds:  The amount of additional funds needed for this contract is $867,235.00. The original contract was established without funding. The total City cost of the original contract and all modifications is $11,488,145.00. This modification represents an extension of the contract period of December 1, 2021 through and including November 30, 2022.\n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  The need for additional funds was foreseen and an extension is provided in the original contract. This legislation is to cover the funds budgeted for remainder of fiscal year 2021 through and including November 30, 2022 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used:  This contract is for 10 years with a 5-year extension provided in the original contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.                     How cost was determined:  The cost, terms and conditions are in accordance with the original agreement as modified.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $867,235.00 is needed and budgeted for this modification.\n \n$808,920.13 has been spent in 2021\n$1,165,070 was spent in 2020                     \n$1,087,601.66 was spent in 2019\n \nSUPPLIER:  Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC (20-3524137), DAX Vendor #001253, Expires 12/04/22\nKurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC does not hold MBE/FBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend an agreement on behalf of the City of Columbus between Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC and the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, for the design, construction and operation of the Organic Waste Recovery and Reuse System Project, and to authorize the expenditure of $867,235.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund.  ($867,235.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is committed to providing environmentally friendly programs for the beneficial use of yard waste, sewerage sludge, fats, oils and greases and other waste streams from the community, and is continuously searching for alternatives to landfill disposal and to incineration;
