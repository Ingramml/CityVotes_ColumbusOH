    "description": "Explanation\n1.  Background\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Laura M. Comek on behalf of her client, Mulby Place Homes LLC, to transfer two portions of City right-of-way.  The portions are approximately 21,690+/- square foot in total.  The details are as follows:  \n \nNo Name Alley - The first portion of the right-of-way area is an unnamed alley running southwest to northeast directionally.  It is the first alley east of Cleveland Avenue; abuts with Myrtle Avenue at the north and a no name alley at the south at the Cleveland Avenue and Briarwood Avenue intersection. (0.110 Acre).  \n \nLinden Avenue - The second portion of the right-of-way area is one street east of the unnamed alley identified in item 1 and is running southwest to northeast directionally.  It abuts with Myrtle Avenue at the north and a no name alley at the south at the Cleveland Avenue and Briarwood Avenue intersection.   (0.357 Acre).\n \nThe intended use for the portions of right-of-way to be transferred is to combine them with parcels adjacent to the right-of-way to support a project being proposed by Mulby Place Homes LLC.  This proposed project will include a small mixed-use of neighborhood-scale commercial structures along the Cleveland Avenue frontage and then affordable senior housing within the remainder of the site.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $16,267.00 was established.  Laura Comek, on behalf of Mulby Place Homes LLC, requested full Mitigation.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on November 18, 2021.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Mulby Place Homes LLC, at no cost to them.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to the City to grant the Right-of-Way transfer.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION \nEmergency action is requested to allow the redevelopment of the site and to meet current development schedules.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of an approximately 21,690+/- square foot portion of City right-of-way to Mulby Place Homes LLC; and to declare an emergency.
