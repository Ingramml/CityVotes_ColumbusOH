    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew a contract (renewal number 2) with Treasurer Franklin County through Franklin County Public Health for an additional year to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000                     .00                     PO209571\nModification No. 1 amount                     $45,000.00                     Ord. 0467-2020                                          PO239190\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $         0.00\nRenewal No. 2 amount                                          $         0.00\nTotal contract amount                                          $90,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazzard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to increase the capacity of the City of Columbus to produce high quality, lead based paint inspections, risk assessments, work specifications, and final clearance testing as outlined in the HUD 2012 Guidelines and to generate lead-safe units in a timely and efficient manner for the citizens of Columbus.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014279 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for Licensed Lead Risk Inspector/Assessor services for the Lead Safe Columbus program.  Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2020, with an option to renew until the grant period has been completed.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract. \n \nIn March 2020, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 0467-2020 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2022.  Barring unforeseen circumstanced, the Director anticipates submitting future legislation to renew this contract annually until the end of the HUD grant and, if necessary, modifying the contract in the interim to add additional funds.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is not needed for this renewal.  Funding remaining on the original purchase order and modification number one shall be utilized under this contract renewal.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006183 and expires 1/16/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract with the Treasurer of Franklin County through Franklin County Public Health for an additional year to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew a contract with Treasurer Franklin County through Franklin County Public Health for an additional year to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ014279 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for Licensed Lead Risk Inspector/Assessor services for the Lead Safe Columbus program, two bids were received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 0467-2020 to modify the contract to add additional funds and the contract term did not change under this ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to renew the contract  so as to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to renew a contract (renewal number 2) with the Treasurer of Franklin County through Franklin County Public Health for an additional year, ending December 31, 2022, to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
