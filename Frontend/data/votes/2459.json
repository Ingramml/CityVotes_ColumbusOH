    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract on behalf of the Department of Public Service with The Lion Electric Corp. for one Electric Powered Automated Side Loading Refuse Truck. \nThe United States Department of Energy (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Office selected Clean Fuels Ohio to receive a grant award as part of the 2020 Advanced Vehicle Technologies Research Funding Opportunity.  Clean Fuels Ohio sought funding to support its Zero Emission Freight Future Project, which is designed to prove viability and operational and financial effectiveness of med-heavy duty Electric Vehicles (EVs) in new fleets and communities.\n \nClean Fuels Ohio, in turn, has named the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection as a sub-recipient for the Zero Emission Freight Future Project, and has provided to the City a reimbursement grant whereby the City must provide funding to cover expenses as they are incurred and subsequently will be reimbursed for up to 50% of eligible expenses. Pursuant to the proposed Sub-Recipient Agreement, the City will be reimbursed a maximum of $500,000 over the three year grant period.  The Department of Public Service will provide documentation for these expenses to Clean Fuels Ohio, who will then reimburse the City for eligible expenses.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, solicited a Best Value Procurement bid for one Electric Powered Automated Side Loading Refuse Truck.\nThis Request for Proposal was formally advertised on the Vendor Services website.  On August 26, 2021 the city received two responses as listed below.  Both proposals were deemed responsive and were fully evaluated by the Evaluation Committee:\n \n\n\n\nBidder/Consultant\n\nCity\n\nFBE/MBE\n\n\n\nThe Lion Electric Corp.\n\nQuebec\n\nMajority\n\n\n\nColumbus Truck Center\n\nColumbus\n\nMajority\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \nAn evaluation committee consisting of two (2) representatives from the Department of Public Service and one (1) from Division of Fleet Management that provide technical expertise.  Each member of the committee scored and ranked written proposals submitted by the offerors.  Both offerors were invited to make oral presentations and then submitted pricing.  After evaluating all offers and viewing two presentations, in compliance with Columbus City Code 329, the committee submitted final rankings.  \n \nThe Lion Electric Corp. received the highest score of 80.67 of 100 points possible. Columbus Truck Center  received a score of 76.67 of 100 points possible. \nIn accordance with the Committee recommendations, the Purchasing Office recommends the award of the contract as follows:\n \nThe contract award will go to The Lion Electric Corporation.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for The Lion Electric Corp. is CC035805 and expires May 17, 2023.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis is a reimbursable budgeted expense of $250,000.00 for this purchase within Fund 2220 (General Government Grant Fund), Grant #592116 (Zero Emissions Freight Future Project).  The grant funds need to be appropriated.  The City is responsible for contributing a local share amount of $328,659.90.  These funds are available within the Refuse GO Bond Fund, Fund 7703.  It is necessary to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget within Fund 7703 to align budget authority with the proper project for this expenditure.  These local match funds are appropriated.\n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested due to the long lead-time required for the truck to be built and delivered, allowing it to be available for refuse collection as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget;
