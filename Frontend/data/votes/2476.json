    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People on behalf of ICANDO Community Development to support the South Side Family Farmstand.\n \nThe South Side Family Farms Farmstand, a project of ICANDO Community Development, can become a community marketplace, a central location for families to purchase and pick up fresh fruits and vegetables. This will provide the South Side neighborhood with fresh food access in addition to economic opportunity and agricultural education for youth. ICANDO Community Development envisions this as being part of a walkable community where residents can have fresh access to vegetables, receive cooking info and demonstrations, and see demonstrations of urban farming utilizing sustainable growing practices. The Farmstand will also build greater capacity to serve people traveling into our community by providing boxes of fresh vegetables through our on-line pre-order website.\n \nIn cooperation with the OSU InFact Buckeye ISA Program, ICANDO teaches youth of the South Side about growing practices with hands-on learning sessions in multiple garden plots. The Farmstand will give youth participating in The InFact Buckeye ISA program an aggregation point, cold storage and a delivery place for pick-up of their CSA style produce package boxes by customers.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any disruption in service for at-risk residents.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into grant agreement with Community Development for All People on behalf of ICANDO Community Development to support the South Side Family Farmstand; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
