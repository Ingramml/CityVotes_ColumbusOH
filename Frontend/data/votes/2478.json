    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  \nThe Office of CelebrateOne has been awarded funds from Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services to support the implementation of a Health Equity Innovation initiative. This ordinance is necessary to accept and appropriate funds in the amount of $98,223.00 for the period of August 1, 2021 - July 31, 2022.\n \nSince 2014, CelebrateOne has led the development and implementation of strategic community-based initiatives targeting the unacceptably high infant mortality rate in Franklin County. Infant deaths are higher in CelebrateOne priority neighborhoods and are fueled by long standing racial disparities, a lack of education, and limited resources and support. \n \nTo help achieve the goal of eradicating infant mortality in Columbus and Franklin County, CelebrateOne has adopted a new strategic plan that calls for deeper investments in racial equity, expanded efforts to address the social determinants of health, and a strong, connected health and social services system. \n \nFranklin County has committed $98,332.00 towards the implementation of innovations in Health Equity to improve health and birth outcomes for mother and baby. Specifically, this funding will support the development of community-based care options that provide: prenatal, postpartum and pediatric care; alternative birthing options; doula, midwife and lactation consultant access; comprehensive dietary support and education; mentoring and counseling services; and connections to community-based resources. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible due to the grant deliverable requirements.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.   \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Health Equity Innovation initiative is funded by the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services. This effort does not generate any revenue or require a City match.    \n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Office of CelebrateOne to accept funds from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services in the amount of $98,223.00; to authorize the appropriation to the Office of CelebrateOne in the City’s Government Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($98,223.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, $98,223.00 in grant funds have been made available to the Office of CelebrateOne from the Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services for the development and implementation of a Health Equity Innovation initiative; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Office of CelebrateOne in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the acceptance of funds from the Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services, and to appropriate these funds, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Office of CelebrateOne is hereby authorized and directed to accept funds in the amount of $98,223.00 from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services for the Health Equity Innovation initiative for period beginning August 1, 2021 and ending July 31, 2022. \n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the fund known as the City’s Government Grants Fund, Fund No. 2220, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources during the grant period, the sum of $98,223.00 is appropriated upon receipt of an executed grant agreement and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated to the Office of CelebrateOne Department, Division No. 40-05, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n                \nSECTION 3.  At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
