    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate in the amount of $1,000,000.00 to fund support for the Columbus Promise Initiative.\n \nThe Columbus Promise Initiative is a partnership among the City of Columbus, Columbus State Community College, I Know I Can, and Columbus City Schools to support post-secondary school opportunities for Columbus City School graduates. Under this program, students who graduate from Columbus City Schools during phase one of the program (classes of 2022, 2023, and 2024), complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and an application to Columbus State can attend Columbus State full-time or part-time for up to six semesters in order to complete a two-year degree or certificate program.\n \nOnce enrolled in Columbus State, students can obtain funding support by maintaining federal aid standards for satisfactory academic progress. In addition to covered tuition and fees, Columbus Promise Scholars will receive up to $1,000 annually for transportation, books, and other life expenses. Columbus State Community College will also implement a comprehensive set of wraparound career, academic, and financial support services to assist students, including dedicated Promise coaches with small student caseloads.\n \nThe Columbus Promise program is an opportunity to address equity disparities in higher education, invest in the City’s youth, and lower the burden of the costs associated with pursuing post-secondary education.\n \nAn ordinance is presently necessary for the City’s contribution. Once programmatic and partnership details are finalized, ordinance(s) seeking Council authorization to enter into contract(s) will be submitted.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so that a certificate can be established prior to the City Auditor’s 2021 year-end deadline.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,000,000.00 is budgeted and available in the 2021 General Fund budget in support of this initiative.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate in the amount of $1,000,000.00 to fund the support of the Columbus Promise Initiative; to authorize the transfer of $1,000,000.00 within the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
