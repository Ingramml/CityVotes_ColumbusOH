    "description": "Explanation\nIn the Fall of 2019, President Pro Tempore Elizabeth Brown, the Mayor’s Office, and the Columbus Women’s Commission were awarded a CityStart grant from Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund) supporting the creation of a Financial Empowerment Roadmap to help women and families achieve financial security. Prior to the pandemic, one in four women were financially insecure, with women of color facing disproportionate financial challenges. Women have since experienced higher rates of job loss and slower job recovery than men during the economic downturn of the pandemic, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Thus, the financial hardships facing women and families in Columbus have only been deepened since early 2020.\n \nWith the knowledge that an extreme economic shock such as a global health crisis could have an outsized impact on families already experiencing financial insecurity, CFE Fund developed a new funding opportunity for existing grantees shortly after the pandemic struck. The City of Columbus applied successfully for $80,000 to launch the Financial Navigator program to support families’ increased need for resource navigation during the health crisis.\n \nThe City successfully launched the Financial Navigator program in the Fall of 2020 with the partnership of the Legal Aid Society of Columbus and Lutheran Social Services, enabling residents to seek the help of trained financial navigator staff to understand and connect to new and existing federal, state, and local resources intended to support them through financial struggles.\n \nIn 2021, Columbus has received support to develop a plan for investing in free, professional, one-on-one financial counseling as a public service to residents through the Financial Empowerment Center model, particularly of need as they deal with the financial impacts of COVID-19. Columbus is one of 35 local governments across the country that are working with the CFE Fund to offer this proven model, developed initially by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in New York City in 2008, and has received a grant for $150,000 in 2022 to plan for the launch of this Financial Empowerment Center.\n \nThe city issued a Request for Proposals (RFQ019295) for the launch of a Financial Empowerment Center, and received two responsive proposals. An evaluation committee reviewed and scored both proposals and recommended that the Department of Development enter into contract with Jewish Family Services of Columbus.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Department of Development to accept a grant award of $150,000 from the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund) and to authorize the appropriation of funds for each grant upon receipt of the funds.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to enter into contract with Jewish Family Services of Columbus to plan for and launch a Financial Empowerment Center in spring 2022. The total amount of this contract is $300,000.\n \nJewish Family Services will act as the Financial Counseling Provider to provide free, professional, one-on-one financial counseling services to Columbus residents as a municipal service. The funding provided will be used to hire three (3) financial counselors and one (1) program manager to be trained and employed by Jewish Family Services for the provision of financial counseling services. These services cannot be provided by current City employees at this time.\n \nEmergency action is request in order to avoid delay in the planning and launch of the Center and provision of its financial counseling services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available through the private grants fund and the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle \nTo authorize the Director of Development to apply for and accept a grant from Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, Inc.; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Cities for Financial Empowerment, Inc.; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into non-profit service contract with Jewish Family Services of Columbus for planning the launch of a Financial Empowerment Center; to authorize an appropriation and transfer within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize an expenditure within the private grants fund; and to declare an emergency.
