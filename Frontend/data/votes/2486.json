    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Education to enter into contract with The Columbus Foundation to serve as charitable gift recipient for The Columbus Promise Program.\n \nWe are falling short of the statewide goal of 65% higher education attainment by 2025. As of 2018, just 45.6% of Franklin County adults had achieved a higher education degree or credential, and the projection is that it would take Columbus nearly another 40 years to achieve a 65% attainment rate. Furthermore, there are stark racial gaps in higher education attainment: white residents attain higher education credentials at a rate 15% higher than their Black or Hispanic counterparts.\n \nBut we also know that achieving a higher education degree or credential is the key to so many determinants of long-term success: higher wages, financial stability, even improved personal health. Additionally, studies around the country have noted that, when students are more confident of their ability to afford the opportunity to enroll in higher education, there is an across-the-board increase in grade point averages, higher enrollment in AP classes, and improved graduation rates.\n \nTo this end, the City of Columbus, in partnership with local corporations, charitable institutions, and higher education institutions, will provide the funding necessary to transform the educational and economic landscape of the city through the creation of the Columbus Promise. Beginning with the current 2021-2022 school year, the Columbus Promise Program will provide all graduates of Columbus City Schools with the opportunity to earn a two-year degree from Columbus State Community College, and to do so debt free. In addition, students will receive up to $1,000 in a yearly stipend to cover the cost of books and other incidentals.\n \nEmergency action is requested to provide for the immediate enactment of the service agreement with The Columbus Foundation in order to allow for philanthropic contributions to the Columbus Promise Fund prior to the end of the calendar year.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Education to enter into contract with The Columbus Foundation to serve as charitable gift recipient for The Columbus Promise Program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($1,200,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, as of 2018, just 45.6% of Franklin County adults had achieved a higher education degree or credential, and the projection is that it would take Columbus nearly another 40 years to achieve a 65% attainment rate; and\n \nWHEREAS, matriculation rates continue to fall, in part because of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, but also because of the affordability of higher education for many of Columbus’ most vulnerable residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, we know that achieving a higher education degree or credential is the key to so many determinants of long-term success, such as higher wages, financial stability, and improved personal health; and\n \nWHEREAS, beginning with the current 2021-2022 school year, the Columbus Promise Program will provide all graduates of Columbus City Schools with the opportunity to earn a two-year degree from Columbus State Community College, and to do so debt free; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with The Columbus Foundation in order to allow for philanthropic contributions to the Columbus Promise Program Fund prior to the end of the calendar year; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Education is hereby authorized to enter into contract with The Columbus Foundation to serve as charitable gift recipient for The Columbus Promise Program.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $1,200,000.00 within the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That per the action authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $1,200,000.00 is hereby authorized within the Job Growth subfund per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 6. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared an emergency measure and shall take effect and be enforced from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
