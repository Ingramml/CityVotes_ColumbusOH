    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The SWWTP operating staff is currently digesting all biosolids in the existing digester train. The addition of the Chemically Enhanced Primary Treatment (CEPT) has created an additional peak loading to the digester train, and can overwhelm the system due to the lack of capacity. This project will be providing an additional digester to meet peak capacity demands and will be providing process upgrades to create a more efficient digestion system. \n \nPlanning Area - 99 - Citywide\n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: Contract work is required to be substantially complete in a manner acceptable to the City within 1,125 days from the date that a Notice To Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nPROCUREMENT INFORMATION: The Division advertised for competitive bids submission for the subject services on the City's Vendor Services website and in the City Bulletin in accordance with the overall provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code. The Division of Sewerage and Drainage received three (3) bids on October 13, 2021 from the following: \n \n\n\n\nNAME\n\nTAX ID\n\nDAX #\n\nCity/State\n\nStatus\n\nExpiration\n\n\n\nBowen Engineering\n\n35-1136995\n\n007022\n\nIndianapolis, IN\n\nMAJ\n\n9/1/2022\n\n\n\nKokosing Industrial, Inc.\n\n47-2946608\n\n012309\n\nColumbus, OH\n\nMAJ\n\n6/2/2023\n\n\n\nKenmore Construction\n\n34-0802152\n\n006456\n\nAkron, OH\n\nMAJ\n\n6/8/2022\n\n\n \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION is not requested at this time. \n \nECONOMIC / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: This project will increase the beneficial re-use of biosolids in the liquid land application and deep row hybrid popular (DRHP) programs by providing more anaerobically-digested Class B biosolids. The primary goal of this project is to provide sufficient expanded anaerobic digestion facilities and all necessary associated piping and pumping capacity to successfully accommodate the addition solids produced by the Chemically Enhanced Primary Treatment (CEPT) process and the additional solids loadings to the SWWTP resulting from the anticipated growth of the population of the City of Columbus.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This Ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund 6102 to the Ohio Water Development (OWDA) Loan Fund 6111 in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the OWDA Loan Fund and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in December, 2021.  Additionally $2,000.00 is necessary for Prevailing Wage Services from the Department of Public Service.  The transfer within and expenditure of $2,000.00 is needed from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109, as is an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.  This ordinance will also amend Ord. 2762-2020, which authorized the Department of Public Utilities to apply for and accept loan funding from the Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), in order to increase the maximum dollar amount of this project's loan award not to exceed $27,765,100.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kenmore Construction Company, Inc. for the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant Digester Process Expansion Project; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $27,765,100.00 from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund to the Ohio Water Development (OWDA) Loan Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $27,765,100.00 from the Ohio Water Development (OWDA) Loan Fund; to authorize an expenditure up to $2,000.00 for prevailing wage services to the Department of Public Services within the Sanitary General Obligations Voted Bonds Fund; to amend Ord. 2762-2020 in order to increase the maximum dollar amount of this project's Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Funding loan award to not exceed $27,765,100.00; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.
