    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to modify a contract with Converge One, Inc. for the purchase of hardware, licensing, professional services and co-termed maintenance and support services associated with Genesys Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, in the amount of $589,523.01, for a coverage period through April 30, 2026.  The current IVR system is used by the city’s 311, Public Utilities, BZS, and Technology Help Desk call centers.  Earlier this year, The Department of Technology established the existing contact with CovergenOne, Inc. for a coverage period through April 30, 2026.  This ordinance will modify the contract to include this upgrade of the City's Genesys IVR Pure Connect system.  This purchase will include funding for related hardware, licensing, professional services, and co-termed maintenance and support with the existing five (5) year contract.  In addition to the upgrade, the Department of Technology is required to comply with Kari's Law and the RAY BAUM's Act for 911 Direct Dialing, notification, and Dispatchable Location requirements.  Under Section 506 of RAY BAUM's Act the City should make all effort to meet the January 6, 2022 deadline.  In order to meet this aggressive deadline, the Department of Technology is also requesting a bid waiver for the purchase of three (3) year licensing of a third-party solution, Red Sky, from our current Genesys Pure Connect vendor, ConvergeOne, Inc., who is the sole vendor authorized to upgrade, support and/or integrate items into the City's Genesys Pure Connect and Pure Cloud system which would include the Red Sky solution.  Red Sky is the required third-party solution to be integrated with the Genesys Pure Connect system and Cisco soft phones which establishes compliancy of Keri's Law and RAY BAUM's Act.\n  \nGenesys Pure Connect is the City's standard on-prem IVR solution for City services that interface with the public such as the City's 311 call center, Parking Services, Public Utilities, etc.  This tool has experienced increased growth and usage within the City as a way for the public to interact with City service offerings as a result of the pandemic.  This contract will provide co-termed maintenance and support for the duration of a five (5) year period through April 30, 2026.  The additional time is to allow us time to bid out the entire system maintenance and support, while continuing to have coverage.  \n \nThis decision is a result of the OEM, Genesys, having a policy of not permitting multiple parties supporting our IVR systems.  The Department of Technology is currently in a three (3) year contract for our Genesys hosted IVR solution and a five (5) year contract for our maintenance and support for our On-Premises IVR solution as a result of CARES Act funding projects and procurement.  The OEM's policy puts us in the position of relying on our current vendor ConvergeOne.  Due to this OEM policy, we cannot bid out our pre-established IVR system's maintenance and support with ConvergeOne to be shared with any other vendor.  Given these circumstances, the Department of Technology requests to waive the provisions of the competitive bidding requirements.\n \nEMERGENCY: \nEmergency action is requested to ensure that the necessary contract and purchase order(s) for the above described services and statements of work occur in a timely manner to ensure service provision without interruption.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER:\nVendor Name:    Converge One, Inc.         CC#: 41-1763228;      Expiration Date: 10/31/2023\n    (DAX Vendor Acct. #: 007864) \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \nEarlier this year (2021), the Department of Technology legislated funds in the amount of $387,237.08 (via Ord.
