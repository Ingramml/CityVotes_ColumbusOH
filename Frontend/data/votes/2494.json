    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $5,000,000.00 to fund reviews and updates to Public Safety’s Computer Aided Dispatching and Records Management Systems. These funds will also be used to support an officer wellness program by providing data analytics and related services.\n \nPublic Safety’s Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) and Records Management Systems (RMS), both of which are primary operational systems, have evolved over time, with many iterations.  Throughout this evolution, these systems have been customized in ways that are unique to the city.  Understanding these customizations, which includes both out of the box customizations within the CAD or RMS platform,  separate third-party integrations with CAD, RMS or both, is vital to the successful development and implementation of new integrated CAD and RMS platform. With a portion of the above-noted funds, the Department of Technology, via the solicitation of proposals, plans to conduct a needs assessment for the eventual upgrade or replacement of both systems.\n \nDoT also plans to use these funds to help support the city’s “officer wellness” program. As part of this effort, DoT will work with Public Safety to identify and integrate data from multiple sources into a data analytics platform geared towards enhancing the wellness of its officers. As with the CAD and RMS projects, DoT plans to solicit proposals for this project with the funds on the certificate authorized by this ordinance. \n \nAfter proposals have been accepted, DoT will submit ordinances seeking Council authorization to enter into contracts. This ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $5,000,000.00 for the purposes described above.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so that a certificate can be established prior to the City Auditor’s 2021 year-end deadline.\n \nFiscal Impact: $5,000,000.00 was expressly budgeted, and is available in the 2021 Information Services operating fund to undertake the projects outlined above.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $5,000,000.00 to develop and implement various projects, including a new integrated Computer Aided Dispatching (CAD) and Records Management Systems (RMS), on behalf of the Department of Public Safety; to authorize the expenditure of $5,000,000.00 from the Information Services Operating fund for the purpose described above, and to declare an emergency.

The Department of Technology will submit future ordinances seeking Council authorization to enter into contracts with selected consultants.\n \nSECTION 2.  To authorize the expenditure of $5,000,000.00 from the Information Services Operating fund for the purpose stated in Section 1.
