    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into rental agreements with Premier Truck Sales and Rental in the amount of up to $300,000.00 for the rental of refuse collection trucks to be used by the Division of Refuse Collection.\n \nThe Division of Refuse Collection (Division) is responsible for providing weekly refuse collection service to the 344,000 residential units within the City of Columbus.  Prior to the COVID pandemic it took nine to twelve months after placement of order to receive a refuse collection truck.  The shutdown of many businesses during the pandemic has caused long delivery delays for these trucks.  The projected delivery date of replacement trucks previously on order has been delayed by many months, and delivery times for new orders are now running twelve to eighteen months after receipt of order.  The Division is experiencing a shortage of refuse collection trucks due to downtime needed for repairs of an aging fleet and the delays in getting replacement vehicles that have been ordered.\n \nIt is necessary to immediately rent refuse collection trucks to continue to provide timely refuse collection to the residents of Columbus.  This will also allow the Division to be able to collect refuse during the normal work week hours and to avoid routinely scheduling mandatory overtime.  The rental of these vehicles is expected to be needed for at least a year to give time for the trucks that have been on order, and for the trucks that are about to be ordered, to be delivered to the City.  An assessment of delivery times of the vehicles on order will be made in the spring of 2022.  At that time it may be necessary to rent additional trucks to accommodate further deficiencies in the Division fleet due to the ongoing pandemic related production delays.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery List (State) produced no findings against Premier Truck Sales and Rental.\n \n2.  REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF FORMAL COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS\nA search was made for companies that rented refuse collection trucks.  Two companies were found within Ohio that rented the trucks.  Of the two companies, Premier Truck Sales and Rental was the only company that had trucks available for rent at this time.  The delay associated with the pandemic in getting delivery of new vehicles has caused a shortage of rental vehicles.  Taking the time required to do a formal bidding process could result in these vehicles no longer being available and delays in the collection of refuse.  A request for waiver of the formal competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is requested due to the need to quickly secure the needed vehicles to avoid delays in the collection of refuse. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nPremier Truck Sales and Rental is not currently registered with the City of Columbus.  Premier has agreed to register with the City and become contract compliant.  A contract will not be executed and the purchase order will not be issued until they become contract compliant.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will come from the General Fund, Fund 1000.  It is necessary to transfer appropriation from Dept-Div 4501 (Financial Management) to Dept-Div 5902 (Refuse Collection).\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so the rental of refuse trucks can occur at the earliest possible time to ensure refuse continues to be collected in a timely manner.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of appropriation within the General Fund from Financial Management to the Division of Refuse Collection; to authorize the waiver of the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements to rent refuse collection trucks from Premier Truck Sales and Rental;
