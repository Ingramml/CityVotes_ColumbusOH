    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The Office of CelebrateOne has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Medicaid which is administered by the State’s Managed Care Plans. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $1,130,000.00 in grant monies to fund the Enhanced Maternal Health Program for the period January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. \n \nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid has awarded $1,130,000.00 to the Office of CelebrateOne at the City of Columbus to coordinate the Enhanced Maternal Health Program in Franklin County. This will allow the current contracts to be increased and extended for six months. Grant funding will provide continued investment in CenteringPregnancy options in priority geographies through Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers and PrimaryOne Health, while also strengthening prenatal home visiting teams at OhioHealth, Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Columbus Public Health. \n \nIn addition, this grant provides support for culturally informed doula care through Restoring Our Own Through Transformation, maintains trauma-informed prenatal support through Moms2B, and provides support to the information and referral line, StepOne for a Healthy Pregnancy. What's more, the grant addresses gaps in service by increasing support for teen outreach through The Center for Healthy Families. \n \nFinally, this grant ensures that the community’s strong core of community health workers at CelebrateOne, Men for the Movement, and the YMCA of Central Ohio continue to connect women and families to services and resources that support a healthy pregnancy.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION:  This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay program services and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $1,130,000.00 in Ohio Department of Medicaid grant monies to fund the Enhanced Maternal Health Program. This program does not generate any revenue or require a City match. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Office of CelebrateOne to accept a grant from the Ohio Department of Medicaid which is administered by the State's Managed Care Plans for the Enhanced Maternal Health Program in the amount of $1,130,000.00; to authorize the appropriation of $1,130,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
