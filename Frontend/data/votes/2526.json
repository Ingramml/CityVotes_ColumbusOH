    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into contracts with Crowe, LLP, to provide for an American Rescue Plan (ARP) Reporting Tool software solution, and associated professional implementation services for gathering and reporting programmatic data for federal grant awards. The solution will support the Department of Finance and Management in its role as the centralized Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) and State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) reporting lead, and allow for the data capture, tracking, and monitoring of sub-recipient program participation as well as outcome and output goals associated with utilization metrics. The current process used by the City is semi-automated by use of standard spreadsheet applications and complimented by manual processes. The manual processes are performed by the Department of Finance and Management and the contracting agencies (i.e., agencies that are sub-awarding funds to other organizations). This software solution will allow for the migration of data from its legacy systems into a new-hosted solution.\nThe anticipated users of the proposed software solution will include the Department of Finance and Management, all City departments, and the City’s sub-recipients engaged in contracting. Authorized users within each department will have access to the data related to their departments. The sub-recipients will use the system to report programmatic data, including outputs, outcome, and demographic data for program participants/recipients.\nThe engagement will involve the creation of three contracts: a consulting services agreement in connection with implementation services for ERAP and Crowe Grant Recipient Tracker for American Rescue Plan Act SLFRF, a consulting services agreement in connection with ongoing support, and a subscription software license agreement.  In addition, this ordinance allows for the creation of an additional contract for Microsoft licensing through Crowe, LLP, if needed.\nIn accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract renewals the contracts may be extended on a year to year basis for up to an additional five years.\nThe City of Columbus utilized a Request for Proposals (RFP) process to identify and assess qualified firms. Proposals were submitted in response to RFQ019760 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to professional service contracts. Crowe LLP received the highest overall score from the RFP committee and as such is being recommended for these subrecipient monitoring services contracts.\nCrowe LLP; CC# 007010 Expires 7/27/2022\nFiscal Impact:  This contract is being funded in the Local Fiscal Recovery Fund.\nEmergency action is requested so that contracts can be entered into immediately to provide for a software solution and associated professional implementation services for gathering and reporting programmatic data for federal grant awards as soon as possible.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into contracts with Crowe, LLP to provide for an ARP Reporting Tool software solution and associated professional implementation services for gathering and reporting programmatic data for federal grant awards; to authorize the expenditure of $120,000.00 from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency ($120,000.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City has a need for an ARP Reporting Tool software solution and associated professional implementation services for gathering and reporting programmatic data for federal grant awards; and \nWHEREAS, the Department utilized a Request for Proposals (RFP) process to identify and assess qualified firms; and\n \nWHEREAS, proposals were submitted in response to RFQ019760 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to professional service contracts and Crowe, LLP, received the highest overall score from the RFP committee; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contracts with Crowe, LLP to provide for an ARP Reporting Tool software solution for gathering and reporting programmatic data for federal grant awards so that such activities can begin as soon as possible, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to enter into contracts with Crowe LLP to provide for an ARP Reporting Tool software solution and associated professional implementation services for gathering and reporting programmatic data for federal grant awards for a term of approximately one year, with the option to extend on a year to year basis for up to an additional five years.\n \nSECTION 2.
