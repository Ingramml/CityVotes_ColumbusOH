($8,866.84)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Environmental Design Group, LLC (EDG) for professional engineering services for the Trail Connections 2019 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $8,866.84. This project is funded by the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) Program.\n \nThis project involves engineering services for improvements to the Olentangy Trail at Dodridge Street and the Alum Creek Trail at Frebis Avenue and Integrity Drive. This modification focuses on the connection to the Olentangy Trail near the Dodridge Street Bridge. Public access to the Olentangy Trail near the Dodridge Street Bridge is limited for over a mile between the Tuttle Park area north to Clinton Como Park at Weber Road. A proposed connection to the Olentangy Trail at Dodridge Street will allow much needed direct access to the Olentangy Trail from the northern portion of the University District.\n \nThe purpose of this contract modification is a result of Recreation and Parks’ decision to change the design and construction drawings from pre-fabricated metal stairs to natural stone steps.  This decision was required as the existing geotechnical conditions of the site do not permit the construction of the initial intended design.  This change in material and application will require the Department and EDG to revisit geotechnical conditions and to design natural stone into the slope instead of drilling piers for foundations. There will also be additional design work related to grading, stormwater management, and construction cost estimating services with the scope change. By modifying this contract, EDG will redesign the connection from the Olentangy Trail to the Dodridge Street Bridge into a more constructible, cost effective trail connection.  To date, EDG has completed the survey and carried the design and construction plans through Stage 2 design. It is more cost effective for the Department to modify EDG’s contract rather than work through another procurement process.  Their fee was determined by using existing hourly rates already established in their contract with the Department multiplied by estimated hours which were negotiated with EDG.   \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEnvironmental Design Group, LLC\n88 East Broad St., Suite 880                                                      \nColumbus, OH 43215\nJeff Kerr, 1-800-835-1390\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 003292, 27-4062134                                  \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: August 10, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that Recreation and Parks can complete the design contract and begin construction as soon as possible in 2022. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year-round benefits to urban lifestyles. Access to trails and to key destinations is one of the top rated priorities noted by residents.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Both locations are UIRF funded projects, have previously been presented to the respective communities, and accepted by the community members as important projects. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Olentangy West (38), University District (44) - All Columbus and regional trail users will benefit from these improvements\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provide safe east/west connections for nearby neighborhoods to the regional trail network.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of 108,312.94 was legislated for the Trail Connections 2019 Project by Ordinance 1261-2019. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $8,866.84. $8,866.84 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
