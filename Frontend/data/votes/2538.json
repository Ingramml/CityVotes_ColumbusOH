    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification (Mod #2) for the Blueprint Linden Hudson McGuffey Project with Gresham Smith and Partners/OH Inc.  The scope of work for this proposed phase of the project is to refine the recommendations included in the Preliminary Design Report previously developed as part of the initial phase of work, and provide detailed design services to produce fully independent construction documents for the green infrastructure (GI) technologies and other related work items necessary to achieve the project goals of: mitigating DSR activations, water-in-basement occurrences (WIBs), and street/yard flooding, as well as provide storm water detention and treatment via the re-purposing of Columbus Land Redevelopment Office (Land Bank), abandoned, and vacant parcels for the implementation of Green Infrastructure (GI).  The specific work activities of this scope include development of detailed construction drawings and bidding documents, meetings with stakeholders, submission of permits and providing responses to all contractor inquires during the bidding process.\n \n1.1 PROJECT MODIFICATION: \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $575,814.52 (Total Expenditure $3,813,962.39)\n \nOriginal Contract (EL016153)                                                                                          $2,199,868.64\nModification #1                      (PO047464)                                                                                            $1,038,279.23\nModification #2 (Current)                                                                                                         $   575,814.52     \nTotal                                                                                                                                                                        $3,813,962.39\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned contract modification. \n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a planned modification.  Re-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and required to be rediscovered by another consultant.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of Mod #2 was determined by negotiations between Gresham Smith and Partners/OH Inc. and DOSD.\n \n2. PROJECT TIMELINE: Original contract plus modification #1 covered 2014 through mid-2021.  This is a planned modification that applies to mid-2021 through 2025. The expiration date of this agreement is December 31, 2025.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:                     An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE NO: 62-1736493 | MAJ | Expires 2/4/22 | Vendor # 009789\n \n5. ECONOMIC / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: The City has embarked upon its approved Wet-Weather Management Plan (WWMP). Currently, that plan is almost entirely comprised of a series of treatment plant capacity upgrades, storage tanks, tunnels, and other piping system augmentations; collectively known as “gray” infrastructure. After approval of the WWMP, the use of more renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly systems, commonly referred to as “green” infrastructure, has been recognized and implemented in many communities as a potential solution to many of the elements associated with consent order requirements. It is anticipated there will be a greater impact to both economic impact and advantages by implementing a group of smaller projects which would be conducive for competition with local suppliers and vendors as opposed to the large scale, previously devised, WWMP projects. Community and Outreach for the project will be conducted by the City, the selected consultant and the Public Outreach Consultant, RAMA Consulting, which is currently under contract for this work. \n \n6. FISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes the Director to transfer and expend up to $478,449.23 in funds from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116, and Funds of $97,364.29 are budgeted, available, and appropriated for this expenditure within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Project 590955 - 100062 CelebrateOne - Blueprint Linden - Hudson McGuffey Sidewalk.
