    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND: General Engineering Consultant (GEC) Services are necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). Initial services are for Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) facilities. Additional DPU facilities may be added in the future.   The GEC services may include the following tasks for small projects: investigations, inspections and evaluations of existing conditions, surveying, preparation of engineering or architectural drawings and specifications, review of contractors’ submittals including shop drawings, maintenance and operation (M&O) manuals, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The GEC services may also include assistance with new equipment or systems start-up and commissioning, instrumentation & control (I&C) work such as Human Machine Interface (HMI) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming, uploading documents onto the City’s Project Management Information System (PMIS), computerized maintenance software, preparation of record plan drawings for small projects, technical assistance in the preparation of Facilities/Equipment Maintenance (FEM) documents, and other similar related tasks. Small projects that may, on occasion, require engineering services under this contract include small Capital Improvement Projects (formerly known as “Plant Improvement Projects” or “PIPs”) and FEM service contracts. \nThe small Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) will vary in nature and can include replacement and upgrade of equipment, materials, structural features,  electrical, or instrumentation & control (I&C) work and their associated appurtenances that have served its useful life.\n \nThe actual construction and commissioning of upgrades in the several facilities will generally be accomplished by others.\n \n \n     Planning Area: 99 (Citywide)\n \n2. PROCUREMENT:  The Division advertised for a Request for Proposals (RFP’s) for the subject services on the City’s Vendor Services website and the Bonfire website in accordance with the overall provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code. The Division of Sewerage and Drainage received two (2) proposals on October 1, 2021 from Hatch Associates Consultants, and T & M Associates. An evaluation committee reviewed the proposals and scored them based on the criteria within Columbus City Code Section 329.  The Department of Public Utilities recommends the agreement be awarded to T & M Associates.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  22-1806708 | MAJ | EXP 06/04/2022 | Vendor # 001614\n \n4. TIMELINE: T&M Associates will begin work after the notice to proceed is given upon execution of this contract. The contract duration is for three (3) years, starting upon the date of Contract Execution (listed on front page of the Engineering Agreement). The professional services shall be funded by incremental appropriation, through the use of approximately annual modifications. There are two (2) planned renewals to this project, December 2022 and December 2023. \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency designation is not requested.\n \n6. ECONOMIC IMPACT: The performance of this project’s activities to provide engineering and technical services for CIPs and FEMs at DPU facilities will help them maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger and more expensive that could produce a major impact to the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n7.
