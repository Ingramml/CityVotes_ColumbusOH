    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This agreement is necessary to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s sixteen Sanitary Pump Stations. The basic services to be provided under this Agreement by the Design Professional are professional study, planning, and preliminary engineering (as necessary). The objective of this program is to provide holistic assessments and evaluations of DOSD’s Sanitary Pump Stations, identify improvements that are required, generate an Improvement Plan, and summarize the program’s information into a Program Definition document.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide\n \nPROCUREMENT: The Department of Public Utilities advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP’s) for DOSD Sanitary Pump Station Evaluation and Upgrade Project #650660-100000 on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites that closed on September 24, 2021.  The city received four (4) responses from the following firms:  GPD Group, Inc., Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc., Prime AE Group, Inc. and Stantec Consulting Services.  All proposals were evaluated in accordance with Columbus City Codes Title 3, Section 329.28, and were scored according to competence to perform, past performance, and understanding of the project approach.  Based upon committee review, GPD Group, Inc.'s proposal was selected as the best fit for the needs of this project based upon the criteria.\n                \nMULTI-YEAR CONTRACT: The Department anticipates requesting additional future renewals to this contract. \n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: This contract is planned for renewals and will span multiple years, concluding in 2024. \n \nContract Compliance No.:  34-1134715 | MAJ | 5/20/2023 | Vendor#: 006560\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is not requested at this time. \n \nEconomic Impact: The performance of these projects’ activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s Pump Stations is needed to plan improvements to maintain peak operational performance.
