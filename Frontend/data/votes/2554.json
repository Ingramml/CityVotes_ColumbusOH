    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a sanitary sewer easement described and recorded in Instrument Number 201609020118518, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”). The Easement burdens real property located in the vicinity of 2431 Silver Drive {Franklin County Tax Parcel 010-269035} (“Servient Estate”) currently owned by Hammerhead Silver LLC, an Ohio limited liability company. The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed a request by the owner of the Servient Estate to vacate the existing easement and determined that the Easement was granted as part of a lot split that did not happen and therefore is no longer needed. DPU has determined that terminating the City’s rights to the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release the City’s sewer easement rights described and recorded in Instrument Number 201609020118518, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
