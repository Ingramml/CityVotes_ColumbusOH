This project was advertised via a new Request for Proposals (RFQ018659) in May 2021. No proposals were submitted. The Division will use the current General Engineering Services agreement with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven dba GPD Group, Inc. for said services.  \n \nThe planning area is “99”, Citywide.\n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:  $250,000.00\nOriginal Agreement:                     $ 150,000.00                     (PO 054007) (Formerly PO 042041)\nModification No. 1:                     $ 150,000.00                     (PO 079280)\nModification No. 2:                     $ 110,000.00  (PO 147078)\nModification No. 3:                     $ 340,250.00  (PO 208010)\nModification No. 4 (current):                                      $ 250,000.00   (PO TBD)\nTotal (Orig. + Mods 1-4):                                        $ 1,000,250.00\n \nReasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThe transmission relocation project was not anticipated. Modification No. 4 (current) will provide funds for supplemental engineering for the Division of Power’s various CIP projects, studies required by OSHA and PERRP i.e. Arc Flash Hazard Analysis, and possibly to reduce backlog of DOP’s routine engineering that may arise from unexpected work force reduction and/or greater than normal  workload volume.  As such, it will not have any economic impact, but it will include community outreach if it is used for projects that typically solicit input from the community.\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original professional services agreement was formally bid on March, 18, 2016.  An original agreement plus two annual modifications were planned. \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe amount of $250,000.00 was obtained by receiving proposals from the consultant for work associated with NextEra and O’Shaughnessy.  The amount required for Customer Development work was obtained by estimating the amount that has been required weekly to perform this work and increasing that to cover the timeframe to get a new General Engineering contract in place.\n \n2.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis is a contract for needed supplemental engineering for the Division of Power’s various CIP projects As such, it will not have any economic impact, but it will include community outreach if it is used for projects that typically solicit input from the community.\n \n3.0 CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  The Contract Compliance Number for Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven dba GPD Group, Inc. is 34-1134715 (expires 5/20/23, Majority, DAX #6560).  Additional information regarding all bidders, description of work, contract time frame and detailed amounts can be found on the attached Information form.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven dba GPD Group, Inc.\n \n4.0 EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency legislation is needed in order that this project remain on schedule. \n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $250,000 from the Electricity G.O.
