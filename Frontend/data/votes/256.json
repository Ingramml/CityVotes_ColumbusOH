    "description": "Explanation \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and to accept funding from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to support work performed as part of the FRA-161-12.83 (at Maple Canyon) project, PID 110376. \nAlso known as the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - SR161 - I-71 to Cleveland Avenue Phase I project, the aforementioned effort encompasses various improvements to Maple Canyon Avenue north and south of SR 161. Planned improvements include the addition of new pedestrian facilities and traffic signals, the installation of mini-roundabouts and raised medians on Maple Canyon, and pavement widening. \nThe Department of Public Service previously applied to ODOT to secure funding to support the completion of that project. ODOT subsequently approved said application and recently awarded the City up to $4,000,000.00 for that purpose. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact at this time.  If necessary, a separate ordinance authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support any anticipated construction costs in excess of the federal funding awarded will be submitted to City Council at a later time. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of requisite agreements and the receipt and acceptance of requisite project funding as soon as reasonably practicable so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the project. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and accept funding from the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the FRA-161-12.83 (at Maple Canyon) project, PID 110376; and to declare an emergency.
