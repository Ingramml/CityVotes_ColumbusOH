    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase the payment funding for utility relocation work as needed by American Electric Power, Columbus FiberNet, Spectrum, Verizon, WOW, and other utilities (or companies hired by utilities to perform utility relocation work) for the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2 and Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 3 projects in an amount up to $280,136.41.\n \nOrdinance 2923-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to pay for utility relocation work by American Electric Power, Columbus FiberNet, Spectrum, Verizon, WOW, and other utilities as needed in an amount up to $3,935,000.00.\n \nThe original contract amount, no inspection:              $3,935,000.00     (ACPO003656, Ord. 2923-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:             $280,136.41     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $4,215,136.41  \n \nThe Department of Public Service is engaged in the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2 and Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 3 projects.  Phases 2 and 3 of the projects consisted of roadway and streetscape improvements to North High Street from Poplar Avenue to King/East 7th Avenue. Project improvements included sidewalk on both sides of High Street, planter beds and street trees, lighting and signal upgrades, storm improvements and undergrounding of both private and public overhead utilities.\n \nIn the course of effecting roadway improvements, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements or place overhead utilities underground to promote public health, safety, and welfare including the economic development of the City.  It is necessary to move utilities to complete this project. \n \nThe funding request for utilities relocation reimbursement is based upon estimates from the utilities.  The utilities will invoice the City for actual costs incurred in relocating the utilities.  The amount needed exceeded the amount originally requested in Ordinance 2923-2018.  \n 2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of unforeseen utility relocation work that was discovered after the utility relocation work began.  This unforeseen relocation work exceeded the project’s original estimated amount.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $280,136.41 are available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested to provide funding for utility reimbursements at the earliest possible time to maintain the project construction schedule to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to pay utility relocation costs to various utilities for the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2 and Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 3 projects;
