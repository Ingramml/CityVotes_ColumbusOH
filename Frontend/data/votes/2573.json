    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into two subrecipient grant agreements with the Community Development Collaborative of Greater Columbus (Collaborative) to administer the City’s CHDO program in an amount up to $215,000.00 using 2022 HOME funds with the agreements term starting January 1, 2022.\n \nThe City is a participating jurisdiction receiving federal funds under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The regulations of the program provide that up to five percent of the annual allocation may be granted to Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs) to pay operating costs of the agencies. CHDOs are nonprofit organizations that work in neighborhoods to develop affordable housing through rehabilitation of existing housing stock and new in-fill construction.\n \nThe department partners with the Collaborative to manage the CHDO program and does so under two subrecipient agreements. Under one subrecipient agreement ($45,000.00), the Collaborative will serve in the role as a funding intermediary, facilitator of training, and builder of organizational capacity. These funds leverage additional public and private funds for operating support of CHDOs. The City and the Collaborative have collectively developed a process for distribution of the funds to eligible CHDOs.  Under the other subrecipient agreement ($170,000.00), the Collaborative will distribute the funds to eligible CHDOs.  \n \nHistorically, the City’s CHDO operating budget has been greater than $170,000.00 annually (the amount fluctuates each year) and the department had sought authority to appropriate and expend the funds after the HOME grant has been executed. Starting with the 2019 HOME grant, the department has sought approval to appropriate and expend a portion of the grant before the grant agreement is executed and then execute a planned subrecipient agreement modification for the remaining amount after the grant amount is known (usually mid-year).  \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2022 HUD Annual Action Plan, per Ordinance 2800-2021.\n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid disruptions in program services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these subrecipient agreements in the amount of $215,000.00 is supported by the anticipated 2022 HOME Investment & Partnership Grant to be awarded to the City of Columbus by HUD.\n \nFunding of the $45,000.00 subaward is as follows:  $45,000.00 2022 HOME administration funds.\n \nFunding of the $170,000.00 subaward is as follows:  $170,000.00 2022 HOME CHDO operating funds.\n \nFunding is contingent upon City Council approval of the 2022 Action Plan under ordinance 2800-2021.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s compliance number is 005635 and expires on 8/20/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $215,000.00 of 2022 HOME funds; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into two subrecipient grant agreements with the Community Development Collaborative of Greater Columbus to provide administrative and CHDO operating support in amount up to $215,000.00, with the period of performance for each subaward starting January 1, 2022; and to declare an emergency.
