Consistent with Resolution 0216X-2008 adopted by Columbus City Council on April 20, 2009 and the Rezoning Ordinance, the Developer Property and Adjacent Property are subject to the requirements of the “Big Darby Revenue Program.” Pursuant to Ordinance 2535-2020 passed by Council on November 23, 2020, the Director of the Department of Development entered into an agreement dated December 1, 2020 with the Developer (the “Big Darby Agreement”) to outline the plans and respective commitments of the City and the Developer for the fulfillment of Big Darby Revenue Program requirements, including establishing the Big Darby West Broad Street New Community Authority (the \"Authority\") in relation to the Developer Property.
