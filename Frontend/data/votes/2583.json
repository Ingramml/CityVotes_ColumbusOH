    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:  Mayor Ginther has charged the Department of Development to develop a Land Acquisition Strategy that will allow the Economic Development Division to be active and strategic in the acquisition, tactical divestment or redevelopment of key development sites across the City of Columbus.  These efforts will provide the City with a “seat at the table” to influence various development activities to occur within the City.  More importantly, these efforts will allow the City to become a catalyst in spurring specific types of development and redevelopment, within various submarkets of the City, where the market is not ready to invest and incentivize that development to take place and occur sooner for the health and welfare of the residents of Columbus.  These activities will occur through 1) site cultivation; 2) strategic corridor investments; and easement acquisitions to support development opportunities throughout the City.\nThe Department of Development seeks to enter into a real property acquisition services contract in an amount up to $250,000.00 to assist the Economic Development team with creating and executing the department’s strategic land acquisition strategy.  The work completed by way of this contract will specifically aid in the Department of Development’s ability to identify, negotiate, and acquire sites that may be strategic in the redevelopment of key development areas across the city and become a catalyst in spurring specific types of development and redevelopment, within various submarkets of the City, where the market is not ready to invest. By way of this ordinance, the Auditor will be authorized to encumber the funds that are anticipated to be needed for the contract.  The department is currently engaged in the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, but the process will not be completed, nor legislation ready, before City Council’s last meeting in 2021. It is estimated that the contract will be executed in February 2022. The Department will submit an ordinance authorizing the Director to enter into contract with the firm who is chosen from the RFP process.  Funding for this agreement, up to $250,000, was planned and is available within the Administration Division’s General Fund budget.  \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to encumber the funds before the end of the fiscal year.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $250,000.00 has been planned and is available within the Economic Development Division’s General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to encumber the funds for a real property acquisition services contract in an amount up to $250,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($250,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Development seeks to encumber the funds for a real property acquisition services contract to assist the Economic Development team with creating and executing the department’s strategic land acquisition strategy; and\n \nWHEREAS,  the Department is currently engaged in the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, but the process will not be completed, nor legislation ready, before City Council’s last meeting in 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, after the RFP process is complete and a consultant has been chosen, the Department will seek Council authorization to enter into contract with the firm; and\n \nWHEREAS, by way of this ordinance, the City Auditor is authorized to encumber the funds for a contract for the services mentioned above with a to-be-determined firm in an amount up to $250,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to encumber the funds before the end of the fiscal year, such immediate action is necessary for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $250,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept Div 44 02 (Economic Development), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.
