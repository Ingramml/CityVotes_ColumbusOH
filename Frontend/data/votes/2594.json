    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate in the amount of $200,000.00 to fund a marketing and education initiative to be directed by CelebrateOne and supported by its partners.\n \nPreliminary data suggests there is reason for concern that the pandemic may be exacerbating the socio-economic challenges faced by the mothers, babies, and families served by CelebrateOne. What’s more, there is worrying anecdotal evidence that the pandemic may be having an impact on the mental and physical well-being of mothers, whether the result of delaying medical attention or forgoing care altogether. \n \nThese funds will be used to deepen CelebrateOne’s marketing and education efforts designed to reach pregnant and parenting families between the ages of 12 and 40 who are NOT receiving information from traditional media sources such as television or radio. The messages expected to be part of this effort will include but are not limited to: \n \n-Substance abuse during pregnancy and how to get help;\n-Need for parent support before, during, and after pregnancy and how to access it;\n-The necessity for first semester prenatal care; and\n-The father’s role in helping to achieve better birth outcomes.\n \nThese funds will help CelebrateOne build upon the work currently funded by Franklin County by providing deepen investment in alternative tools or approaches to illuminate critical messages for pregnant and parenting families. The Office of CelebrateOne plans to solicit proposals for this project with the funds on the certificate authorized by this ordinance. After proposals have been evaluated, the Office of CelebrateOne will submit ordinance(s) seeking Council authorization to enter into contract(s). \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so that a certificate can be established prior to the City Auditor’s 2021 year-end deadline.\n \nFiscal Impact: $200,000.00 is budgeted and available in the 2021 General Fund budget in support of this initiative.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate in the amount of $200,000.00 to fund support of the CelebrateOne marketing and education initiative; to authorize the transfer of $200,000.00 within the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($200,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of CelebrateOne plans to implement a marketing and education initiative in support of its infant mortality reduction efforts; and\n \nWHEREAS, under this initiative, marketing and education tools and approaches will be developed to reach pregnant and parenting families between the ages of 12 and 40 who are NOT receiving information from traditional media sources such as television or radio; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of CelebrateOne plans to solicit proposals for this project with the funds on the certificate authorized by this ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate in the amount of $200,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, after proposals have been evaluated, the Office of CelebrateOne will submit ordinance(s) seeking Council authorization to enter into contract(s); and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of CelebrateOne in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate in the amount of $200,000.00 so that a certificate can be established prior to the City Auditor’s 2021 year-end deadline to ensure the availability of funds in the upcoming months to provide support for the CelebrateOne marketing and education initiative, for the preservation of public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
