    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Local Matters, in an amount up to $50,750.00, to support efforts to connect food donations to agencies that will redistribute the donations to people in need.\n \nLocal Matters will be acting as fiscal sponsor on behalf of Food Rescue US who will match available food donations with agencies in need of donations.  Through Food Rescue US’ coordination efforts, the donated food is then delivered from donor to recipient. FRUS-CBUS has expanded dramatically since the beginning of the pandemic. During the course of the Coronavirus pandemic, FRUS-CBUS was still able to coordinate distribution of 2.5 million pounds of food, roughly equivalent to 2 million meals, in 2020.  Further, through their work distributing USDA Farmers to Families boxes from July 2020 to May 2021, over 100 Food Rescue volunteers delivered more than 4.1 million pounds of food to more than 150 recipient sites through that program. The experience with Farmers to Families prepared FRUS-CBUS to participate in the Partnership for a Healthier America’s twelve-week Good Food for All program from August to October 2021, distributing boxes of fresh produce weekly to more than 1,000 Columbus families.  FRUS-CBUS’ mission of diverting food from landfills and increasing access to food for those who need it is a growing need in the Columbus community.  As FRUS-CBUS continues to grow, the need to expand operations and increase staffing is imminent.  This grant will help ensure those needs are met head on.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to allow program services to be implemented without delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund ($50,750.00).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:   vendor number is 000411 and expires on 10/06/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Local Matters, in an amount up to $50,750.00 to support Food Rescue US efforts to connect food donations to agencies that will redistribute the donations to people in need; to authorize the appropriation of $50,750.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize an expenditure of $50,750.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($50,750.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Local Matters will be acting as fiscal sponsor on behalf of Food Rescue US; and\n \nWHEREAS, Food Rescue US matches available food donations with agencies in need of donations; and\n \nWHEREAS, through Food Rescue US’ coordination efforts, the donated food is then delivered from donor to recipient; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to enter into a grant agreement with Local Matters to support Food Rescue US efforts to connect food donations to agencies that will redistribute the donations to people in need; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to execute a grant agreement with Local Matters and to make the funds available so that program services can continue without interruption thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to execute a grant agreement with Local Matters in an amount up to $50,750.00.\n \nSECTION 2.
