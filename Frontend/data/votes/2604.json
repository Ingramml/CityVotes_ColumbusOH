    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Farmers Market Network to support FarmsSHARE (Farms Serving Health and Racial Equity).\n \nFarmsSHARE supports neighborhood farmers markets and farm stands, community gardens and neighbors in food deserts by providing fresh, locally grown food through multiple distribution methods such as free distribution, traditional farmers markets and pay-what-you-can.\n \nCreated during the global pandemic, FarmsSHARE provided fresh, healthy food to people who were struggling to feed themselves and their families a healthy diet in the middle of an economic crisis. At the same time, Ohio farmers and urban growers found their farmers markets, restaurant and institutional relationships strained, even shuttered. Those who relied solely on direct-to-consumer outlets were significantly impacted by decreased or cancelled orders, just as the Ohio growing season was ramping up.\n \nToday, while the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on supply chains, challenge our neighbors and farmers financially and emotionally, and global warming challenges our agricultural sector, FarmsSHARE will continue to connect Columbus area local food focused community organizations who feed their communities (host locations) and Columbus urban growers and Ohio farmers who grow the food. Recruitment will continue to focus on identifying organizations led by black, indigenous and people of color to serve as host locations, and black, indigenous and growers and farmers of color to provide the produce. The program will continue to purchase fresh produce from Ohio farmers and urban growers during the peak growing season to distribute weekly in our communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any disruption in service for at-risk residents.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into grant agreement with the Ohio Farmers Market Network to support FarmsSHARE (Farms Serving Health and Racial Equity); to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($20,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, FarmsSHARE supports neighborhood farmers markets and farm stands, community gardens and neighbors in food deserts by providing fresh, locally grown food through multiple distribution methods such as free distribution, traditional farmers markets and pay-what-you-can; and\n \nWHEREAS, Created during the global pandemic, FarmsSHARE provided fresh, healthy food to people who were struggling to feed themselves and their families a healthy diet in the middle of an economic crisis; and\n \nWHEREAS, FarmsSHARE will continue to connect Columbus area local food focused community organizations who feed their communities (host locations) and Columbus urban growers and Ohio farmers who grow the food; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Board of Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize a grant agreement with the Ohio Farmers Market Network in order to avoid any disruption in service for at-risk residents; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1:  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Farmers Market Network to support FarmsSHARE (Farms Serving Health and Racial Equity).\n \nSECTION 2:  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $20,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, to Columbus Public Health per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3:  That the expenditure of $20,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1 of this ordinance, is hereby authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4:  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
