    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew (Renewal #4) an existing engineering agreement with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities Upgrade, General Program #4, Overall Engineering Consultant Services (WWTF Upgrade GP #4 OEC), CIP 650360-100002. The project scope includes basic services provided under this agreement and the professional engineering services necessary for, and incident to, the Overall Engineering Consultant Services for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities Upgrade - General Program #4.  The Overall Engineering Consultant Services (OEC) agreement is necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the City and its design professionals in planning and coordination of the work.   The OEC services are separated into several tasks, as follows: \n \nTask 1 - Planning Services                                                                                                         Task 4 - Commissioning and Start-up Services\nTask 2 - Design Services                                                                                                         Task 5 - General and Additional Services\nTask 3 - Construction Related Services                                          Task 6 - Project Management\n \nThe City will request a task order from the consultant as necessary work is identified.  The task order submitted will include a detailed scope of work, direct and indirect costs, task schedule, estimated hours, personnel categories required with labor rates, and reimbursable expenses.  After negotiation and upon acceptance by the city, the consultant shall commence work.  The Engineer shall provide such professional engineering services as may be necessary to accomplish the work required to be performed and shall at the firm’s cost, furnish all necessary competent personnel, equipment, and materials to perform the work.\n \n(For additional information regarding the OEC tasks, please see the attached Director’s Information Sheet Section 5.)\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $1,000,000.00\nOriginal Contract                                                                                                         $1,000,000 PO034617\nModification #1                                                                                                                              $1,000,000 PO095735\nRenewal #1                                                                                                                          $1,000,000 PO153882\nRenewal # 2 (2019 funding)                                                                       $1,609,900 PO209574\nRenewal # 3 (2020 funding)                                                                       $1,000,000 PO264043\nRenewal # 4 (2021 funding)                                                                                            $1,000,000 (current)\nCURRENT PROPOSED TOTAL                                                                       $5,609,900\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThis is a planned contract modification/renewal and the additional services were identified in the original contract ordinance.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis work was originally planned as a 6-year effort funded by annual renewals because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them. Bidding out this work would risk funding this substantial startup effort again, and would require the multi-year work to start again at the beginning.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost was negotiated between the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and the vendor, Black & Veatch Corporation. \n \n2. PROJECT TIMELINE: Black & Veatch received notice to proceed on December 7, 2016. The contract duration is six (6) years, ending in December 2022.  The professional services shall be funded by incremental appropriation, through the use of approximately annual modifications. This renewal is planned to provide the services listed above until the next planned modification.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n    \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  43-1833073 | MAJ | Exp. 09/2/2023| Vendor # 008038\n5. ECONOMIC IMPACT: The project provides many metrics on various environmental factors that are noted in the work to be performed.  The information provided assists and guides the City in decision making on environmental issues.  These decisions have a direct impact on the capital improvement program budget amounts and scheduling to address the environmental needs.  No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n6. FISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes the transfer within and expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget is also needed to align the authority with the expenditure.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities Upgrade, General Program #4, Overall Engineering Consultant Services; to appropriate, transfer within, and expend up to $1,000,000.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget.
