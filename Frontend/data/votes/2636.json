    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Hypochlorite Disinfection Improvements Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690486-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2132.\n \nThis agreement provides Professional Engineering Services to convert the HCWP disinfection process from the current gas based chlorine system to a liquid sodium hypochlorite disinfection system.                     \n \nWork performed to date under this contract includes preliminary design services, detailed design, and bidding services to be conducted in the coming weeks.\n \nContract Modification No. 2 (current) will provide Initial Engineering Services During Construction.  Since this is a multi-year project, a future contract modification is anticipated for Final Engineering Services During Construction.\n \nThe Community Planning Area for the Hap Cremean Water Plant is “99 - Citywide” since it provides service to several communities.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,950,000.00\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $   587,000.00                     (PO053678 {replaces PO042581})\nRenewal #1:                     $2,159,645.00                     (PO190205)\nModification #2 (current):                     $1,950,000.00\n                     $4,696,645.00\nModification #3 (future):                     $1,000,000.00                     (estimate)\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Mods.)                     $5,696,645.00\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis contract modification was anticipated and explained in original Ordinance No. 2817-2016 and in Renewal #1 Ordinance No. 1754-2019, however the scope of services needed differ, therefore a modification is needed.   \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the preliminary design work and detailed design work to date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project and delay the timeline for replacing the existing chlorine gas system.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the remainder of services during construction.  City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved these cost summaries.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This project will address the risks associated with a gaseous chlorine system while providing a safer storage and handling system for plant staff.  The potential threat of an accidental or intentional release of chlorine gas will be eliminated with this project.\n \nThis work will occur within the secure area of the HCWP that is not accessible to the public, so public meetings are not anticipated. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  57-0373224, expires 3/18/23, MAJ, DAX No. 9409.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis U.S., Inc.\n \n4. FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  A future contract modification request is anticipated for Final Engineering Services During Construction.\n \n5.
