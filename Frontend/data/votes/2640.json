    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT) to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract/Purchase agreement (UTC/PA) to acquire and establish a new Cisco Meraki boundary network and Cisco VOIP phone hardware. \n \nThrough utilization of the Best Value Procurement (BVP) process, proposals were recently solicited for the above-named projects via RFQ020154. Submissions were received from two offerors: CDW Government (CDWG) and CBTS. Proposal evaluation was done in two phases. In the first phase, offerors were evaluated on BVP requirements. In the second phase, proposals were evaluated according to the offeror’s competence, past performance, quality and feasibility, ability, and cost. CDWG scored higher than CBTS in these evaluations, and thus, the recommendation is that the award be made to CDWG. Companion ordinance 3266-2021, which awards the contract to CDWG as a universal term contract/purchase agreement (UTC/PA), has been submitted by the Purchasing Office of the Finance and Management. Passage of this ordinance, therefore, is contingent on passage of 3266-2021.\n \nWith passage of this and the above-noted companion ordinance, DoT will procure hardware, licenses, and maintenance and support (for the first 5 years); training, and professional services (for project management); the installation, configuration, and implementation of a Cisco Meraki boundary network; and the migration of NEC phone systems to a Cisco VOIP phone system at various priority locations. These locations include City Hall, Police Headquarters, Columbus Public Health, Jerry Hammond Center, and various other sites around the city. \n \nThe replacement of this existing legacy infrastructure will improve both the boundary network and VOIP phone performance, capacity, security, and ensure that the City continues to keep its boundary network and VOIP phone infrastructure modern and supported.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes amending the current capital improvement budget with the transfer of cash and authority between projects. This is necessary to ensure that there is adequate funding in the proper project.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $7,022,487.85 (which includes contingency funds) for above-described project. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT \nFunding for the above-described project is available in the current capital improvement budget (CIB). This ordinance authorizes the transfer of authority and cash within the CIB to the appropriate project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nCDW Government LLC\nCC/FID #: 36-4230110, Expires 2-12-2022\nD365 vendor #: 007352\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT) to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract/Purchase agreement for network upgrades; to amend the 2021 capital improvement budget; to authorize the transfer of $4,532,488.00 between projects within the Information Services Capital fund; to authorize the expenditure of $7,022,487.85; and to declare an emergency.
