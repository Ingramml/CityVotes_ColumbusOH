    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into professional services contract with Carpenter Marty Transportation in the amount of up to $200,000.00 for the Roadway - RTMC Mobility project.\n \nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources for the RTMC Mobility project.  The Renner Road, Trabue Road, McKinley Avenue Corridor forms a route from the west side of Columbus to Downtown, servicing many communities and providing crucial access to local state and national vehicular transportation systems.  The area has had and will continue to have several projects in various developmental stages along its path.  This has greatly increased the amount of traffic and raised community concerns.  \n \nThe Thrive Companies contracted with Carpenter Marty Transportation to complete the first phase of analysis of the corridor.  The Department of Public Service will be engaging Carpenter Marty Transportation to provide the city with the second phase of analysis of how future developments will affect the corridor and how to best address future community transportation needs.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Carpenter Marty Transportation.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number Carpenter Marty Transportation is CC008494 and expires 10/14/2023.  \n \n3. BID WAIVER\nThe Thrive Companies engaged Carpenter Marty Transportation to conduct a preliminary study of the area.  The Department of Public Services is requesting a bid waiver to enter into contract with Carpenter Marty Transportation in order to advance the study.  This is more cost efficient then bidding the contract out and starting with a new designer.  A bid waiver for the formal bidding requirements of Columbus City Code is requested to enter into contract.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis project is funded by a contribution of $25,000 from Metro Development, LLC and a contribution of $50,000 from Preferred Living, in Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Improvement Non Bond Fund. An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of cash and appropriation is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Funds will need to be appropriated.\n \nThe remaining $125,000 is available in Fund 1000, General Fund.  Funds will need to be appropriated.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to expedite this contract to complete the project in a timely manner, to ensure the safety of the travelling public.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to appropriate funds within the Streets and Highway Improvement Non Bond Fund and the General Fund; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highway Improvement Non Bond Fund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Carpenter Marty Transportation for the Roadway - RTMC Mobility project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $75,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Improvement Non Bond Fund and of up to $125,000.00 from the General Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency.
