    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 2004-2017 to allow for a change in project support since the ordinance was approved.  \n \nOrdinance 2004-2017, passed by City Council July 31, 2017, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a contract with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc., dba Homeport, to reinvest federal grant funds that would have been normally repaid to the city into a senior housing project in the American Addition Neighborhood.  However, as Homeport worked with the neighborhood, it was determined that the neighborhood was not supportive of the change from single family home development even after several meetings/presentations.  Instead of returning the funds to the city, the Director of Development is supportive of using these funds for Homeport’s Maple Meadows housing project.\n \nThe Maple Meadows housing project is new construction of 56 rental units in two buildings to be located at 6285 Maple Canyon (43229).  The project will consist of 17 one-bedroom, 30 two-bedroom and, nine three-bedroom units. All units are to be affordable to and occupied by households at or below 30%, 50%, and 60% of the Area Median Income.  The developer has agreed that the 30% AMI units will be offered to families in shelter whose income is sufficient to support the 30% AMI rent. \n \nThis additional funding will assist with increased construction costs due to COVID-19 and supply chain issues.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  is requested in order to maintain the construction schedule.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004842 and contract compliance expires 5/1/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 2004-2017, passed July 31, 2017, to allow for a change in project support since the ordinance was approved; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2004-2017, passed July 31, 2017, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a contract with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc., dba Homeport, to reinvest federal grant funds that would have been normally repaid to the city into a senior housing project in the American Addition Neighborhood; and\n \nWHEREAS, during Homeport’s discussions with the neighborhood, the neighborhood decided they did not want a change from single family housing development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development is supportive of using these funds for Homeport’s Maple Meadows housing project instead of the original project in American Addition; and \n \nWHEREAS, additional funding will assist with increased construction costs due to COVID-19 and supply chain issues; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to amend No. 2004-2017, passed July 31, 2017, in order to maintain the construction schedule, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, property, and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That Section 2. of Ordinance No. 2004-2017, passed July 31, 2017, be amended to read as follows:  \"Section 2.  That the Director of the Department of Development be and is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc., dba Homeport, for the purpose of reinvesting the funds from the property sale into the Maple Meadows housing project.”\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes it.",
