    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges to contract with Stenograph for the purchase of 12 stenographer writers.  Formal bid RFQ020253 was done and closed on November 15, 2021 and no bids were received. There are multiple types of writers available but the specific one the court would like to purchase is only offered by one company.  We requested a quote directly from Stenograph and with the quote we received a letter stating that they are a sole source provider of the specific writers the court wants to purchase, therefore we want to waive competitive bidding.\n \nStenograph Federal Tax Id is 36-4143020.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding for this expenditure in the amount of $61,896.00 is budgeted and available within the 2021 general fund budget for stenographer writers.\n \nEMERGENCY:  Emergency legislation is requested to authorize the court to enter into contract and to continue hearing cases in a safe manner as soon as possible.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into the contract with Stenograph for the stenographer writers; to authorize the expenditure of $61,896.00  from the General Fund; to waive the provisions of competitive bidding; and to declare an emergency. ($61,896.00).\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the court has a need for new stenograph writers as our existing ones are 12 years old, not working properly, and out of serviceable range; and \n \nWHEREAS, $61,896.00 is needed to purchase new stenographer writers and engage in a one-time contract with Stenograph for stenographer writers; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Franklin County Municipal Court has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into contract with Stenograph; and\n \nWHEREAS, there are multiple types of writers available but the specific one the court would like to purchase is only offered by one company therefore we want to waive competitive bidding; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Franklin County Municipal Court  and it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract and authorize the expenditure for stenographer writers with Stenograph, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Finance and Management be and is hereby authorized to enter contract with Stenograph for new stenographer writers.\n \nSECTION 2. This Council finds it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to waive the relevant provisions of Columbus City Codes Section 329 to permit the aforementioned purchase.\n \nSECTION 3. That the expenditure of $61,896.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary, is authorized to be expended from the general fund, to pay the costs thereof.  \n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
