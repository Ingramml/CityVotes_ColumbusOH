Alsaada et al., v. City of Columbus et al., United States District Court Case No. 2:20-cv-3431 (“the Lawsuit”). \n \nPlaintiffs’ factual allegations (referred to in this Ordinance as “the Events”) are fully described in their Second Amended Complaint filed on May 27, 2021 and can be summarized as follows:\n \nOn May 25, 2020, the killing of George Floyd, who was being arrested by then Minneapolis Police Department Officer Derek Chauvin for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes, was live-streamed over the Internet for eight minutes and 46 seconds and later televised around the world.  Starting on May 28, 2020, in Columbus, Ohio, Plaintiffs allege that, along with hundreds of thousands in cities, states, and countries, they took to the streets to demonstrate against excessive use of force by police and to express their outrage at the militarization of police forces, the disparate impact on minority communities of law enforcement priorities, and a pattern or practice of governments at all levels tolerating systemic racism and failing to adopt effective policies or implement adequate training, supervision, and discipline of law enforcement officers.\n \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants responded to the protests with excessive use of force, and that said excessive force was purposely used to punish one or more Plaintiffs and other demonstrators, to deter them from continuing to protest and others from joining the protests with which they disagreed, and in order to reclaim the streets.  Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants maliciously prosecuted one or more Plaintiffs to punish them and deter other demonstrators from continuing to protest.  Plaintiffs contend that on May 29 and 30, 2020, a similar dynamic occurred and a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. was imposed on May 30, 2020. \n \nAs a result of the Events, Plaintiffs brought six causes of action, alleging that the officer Defendants used excessive force caused by the deliberate indifference of the City and the Chief in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution; violated the Plaintiffs’ freedom of assembly and expression in contravention of the First and Fourteenth Amendments; committed the torts of gross negligence, battery, and malicious prosecution; and raised a civil action to seek damages due to an alleged violation of the criminal laws.\n \nThe Parties wish to enter into a Settlement Agreement to resolve all claims.  Plaintiffs understand and agree that this Settlement is a compromise of disputed claims, and that the City’s participation in this Settlement Agreement is not to be construed as an admission of liability on the part of the Defendants.\n \nFiscal Impact:                     \n \nFunds were not specifically budgeted for this settlement; however, sufficient monies are the in Department of Finance’s Citywide account for this purpose.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Attorney to settle any and all claims arising out of the Events described in the case captioned Tamara K.
