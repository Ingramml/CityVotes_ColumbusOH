    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance modifies the grant agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation originally authorized by ordinance 1268-2021 for administration of the program providing exterior home repair to address code violations.\n \nColumbus Next Generation (“NextGen”) has been working with The City of Columbus, Office of the City Attorney, and the Franklin County Environmental Courts to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes that are in the court systems (and have been) since prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass.  The homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs.  Their incomes are very limited. In July 2021, City Attorney Zack Klein’s office requested and received grant money in the amount of $100,000 to start the Home Repair Program.  NextGen works with local contractors and encourages minority participation as much as possible.  All contractors are licensed, bonded, have BWC insurance and are registered with the City of Columbus as a contractor (in order to pull necessary permits, if needed, for repairs).  Once repairs are complete, NextGen contacts the City Code Officer that referred properties to the court system to make sure the repairs meet the requirements to close out the current code violations.  Since September 2021, NextGen has repaired six homes with several more being scheduled.  All participates are referred through the City Attorney’s Office and the Franklin County Environmental Court. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes an extension of the original agreement through December 31, 2022, and increases the available funding by $100,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any disruption in the exterior home repair program.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify an existing agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus Next Generation has been working with the City of Columbus Office of the City Attorney and the Franklin County Environmental Courts to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes; and\n \nWHEREAS, repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass; and\n \nWHEREAS, the homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs; and\n \nWHEREAS, since September 2021, NextGen has repaired six homes with several more being scheduled; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the CIty Attorney's Office that it is immediately necessary to authorize a contract modification with Columbus NextGen in order to avoid any disruption in the exterior home repair program, for the preservation of the health, safety, and welfare of residents; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
