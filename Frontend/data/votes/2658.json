    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into contract with WCMH in support of the Cleaner Columbus Initiative.\n \nCleaner Columbus is beginning its community-wide education and marketing campaign on the importance of litter eradication and neighborhood beautification. Cleaner Columbus, in partnership with WCMH, will develop the wider message platform and resources to reach inclusive demographics within Columbus including a special focus on K-12 and opportunity neighborhoods. The high impact marketing and public education messaging will be developed for each for each targeted audience, including Columbus residents, neighborhood leaders, professional associations, businesses, and employee groups.  City Council’s goal is to incorporate its new  Cleaner Columbus education, messaging, and mascot with  Keep Columbus Beautiful’s \"Pick it Up” and design challenge and service credit programs. \n \n \nThe marketing campaign will be comprised of three (3) key marketing elements: Cleaner Columbus PSAs, recruitment of individual volunteers and recruitment of volunteers through businesses and organizations. The Public Service Announcements will serve as a key educational tool targeting the general public on how to properly dispose of waste and the impacts of not doing so. As well, recruitment efforts will encourage residents to get involved and volunteer in neighborhood litter pick-ups.  Finally, the third elements will encourage local business and their employee groups to participate in Cleaner Columbus through direct hands-on clean-ups in targeted area neighborhoods.  The overall education campaign elements will include, but not necessarily be limited to,  millions of PSA impressions throughout 2022, social media, mobile advertisements, direct-to-consumer appearances. \n \n \nBid Waiver: The Department of Public Services is requesting a bid waiver to enter into contract with WCMH to create a media campaign in support of the Cleaner Columbus Initiative.
