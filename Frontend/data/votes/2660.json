    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with IMPACT Community Action, in an amount up to $460,000.00, for the “Women’s Empowerment Initiative, Sojourn” program. \n \nAccording to Columbus, OH data, women are more likely than any other group to have attended some college or received an Associate’s degree.  Despite these educational achievements, women are still the most likely to live in poverty, making up 24% of Columbus' poorest residents.  The Coronavirus pandemic has put individuals, especially single female head of households, at an increased risk of falling deeper into poverty.  To lift women out of poverty, public, and private entities must join forces, and implement solutions that address the myriad ways that structural and societal racism uniquely burden women.  It is imperative that we are intentional about creating programs and services that alleviate such barriers.  If not, the present trajectory perpetuates a lifetime of poverty for women and their children.\n \nTo lift women and children out of poverty IMPACT Community Action’s Women’s Empowerment Initiative, Sojourn will be a transformative program, resulting in job creation, reduction in poverty, and the elimination of barriers to employment for women in Columbus, OH.  This program will impact a minimum of 20 women over 7 months. Research proves, investing in women with multiple barriers to self- sufficiency achieves lasting returns for families and the communities they reside within.\n \nThe structure of the Sojourn Women’s Initiative is to build a community that encompasses ideas, information, resources and structured projects that support rapport and unity among women who have been marginalized by circumstances, choices, systemic racist policies, and generational cultural norms, that have served to economically, socially, psychologically disadvantage them over decades.  Before progress can begin to take place, certain truths have to be materialized, to assist participants in being the first champion in their economic recovery.\n \nThis ordinance replaces prior Ordinance No. 1537-2021 and the corresponding auditor’s certificate number ACPO006654.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to allow program services to be implemented without delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the General Fund ($210,000.00), Neighborhood Initiatives subfund ($250,000.00).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 001447 and expires on 12/16/2021.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with IMPACT Community Action, in an amount up to $460,000.00 for the “Women’s Empowerment Initiative, Sojourn” program; to authorize the appropriation of $250,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize an expenditure of $460,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($460,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, women are most likely to live in poverty, in relation to any other group, making up 24% of Columbus' poorest residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Coronavirus pandemic has put individuals, especially single female head of households, at an increased risk of falling deeper into poverty; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is imperative that programs and services that alleviate barriers of structural and societal racism uniquely burdensome to women are implemented; and\n \nWHEREAS, IMPACT Community Action’s Women’s Empowerment Initiative, Sojourn will be a transformative program, resulting in job creation, reduction in poverty, and the elimination of barriers to employment for women in Columbus, OH.; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to enter into a grant agreement with IMPACT Community Action for the “Women’s Empowerment Initiative, Sojourn” program; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to execute a grant agreement with IMPACT Community Action and to make the funds available so that program services can be implemented without delay thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
