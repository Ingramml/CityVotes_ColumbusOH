    "description": "Explanation\nThe Commission on Black Girls studied and assessed the current quality of life for Black girls ages 11-22, residing in central Ohio. Through the culmination of analytic results from listening sessions, focus groups, literature reviews, expert discourse and survey results, the Commission developed and implemented recommendations to ensure opportunities, successful futures and the achievement of a high quality of life for Black girls.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into grant agreements with Image Character Etiquette Inc.; Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Gamma Zeta Zeta Chapter; Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. Sigma Iota Zeta Chapter; Thiossane Institute; Actions That Matter for Youth; The Ohio State University; Bumblebeez; Physicians CareConnection; and Brown Girls Mentoring because they align with the efforts of the Commission on Black Girls.\n \nFounded in 2011, Eryn PiNK (Image Character Etiquette Inc.)  is a Columbus-based non-profit organization dedicated to the empowerment of girls and teens, with a targeted emphasis on creating pathways of advancement for girls and young women of color to thrive.  Their innovative programs provide girls with consistent access to mentorship and tangible resources needed to become leaders in their communities and beyond.\n \nAs a direct response to a survey completed by Eryn PiNK program participants and the feedback of the girls, the Eryn PiNK “She’s Gold Leadership Program” is a training and project-based cohort for middle school age girls. This program offers leadership opportunities where students are equipped and given opportunities to lead and amplify their voices. In addition, the program addresses and provides resources to girls to support mental health concerns, isolation and anxiety caused by COVID-19.\n \nZeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.; Gamma Zeta Zeta Chapter, in partnership with its 501C3 entity, the Gamma Zeta Zeta Education Foundation, serves more than 75 young women of color in its programs.  Programs include: \n-                     The From Girls to Pearls Rites of Passage Program \n-                     The Archonette Club\n-                     Zetas Helping Other People Excel (ZHOPE)\n \nThe From Girls to Pearls Rites of Passage Program provides a program for female adolescents of color to prepare them - physically, socially, emotionally, intellectually, spiritually, and culturally for passage from childhood to teen. Targeted constituencies: girls age 13 or in the 8th grade. \n \nArchonette Club & Black Girls Programs are high school-aged young ladies who demonstrate an interest in the goals and the ideals of scholarship, sisterly love, and community service. Archonette groups are a nationally recognized auxiliary of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated. Funding will support a HBCU College Tour & Enrichment Programs for Black Girls, as well as a Black Girls Curriculum, Youth Summit, & Mentoring.\n \nZHOPE offers ACT Preparatory Courses, Adopt- a- School literacy & mentoring, and quarterly initiatives.

The chapter is continuously driven to uphold and uplift the sorority’s principles of scholarship, service, finer womanhood and sisterhood.\n​\nSigma Iota Zeta Chapter currently maintains all auxiliary groups- Amicae, Archonettes, Amicettes and Pearlettes. We strive to provide positive role models and opportunities to young ladies in the community as well as provide women the avenue to come together in the name of Zeta, as a friend to Zeta.\n \nThe Sigma Iota Zeta Affiliates have 4 strands of curriculum:\n \n• Cultural Awareness and Social Skill Enhancement:\n●                     Our goal is to provide and promote experiences specific to our local Columbus community that bridge the gap between the Black experience (currently/historically) that isn’t taught in schools and the curriculum that is taught in schools.\n●                     While participating in our program the girls will be taught and practice awareness of society’s expected behavioral norms such as active listening, communication, and conflict resolution\n• Educational Enrichment:\n●                     Our meetings and programs aim to strengthen the youths’ knowledge in language arts, math, science, and fine arts. Last year, we had several speakers in different career fields speak with our girls to stress the importance and possibilities with continued education.\n●                     We keep track of our girls’ progress in school, and they receive awards for scholarship.\n• Leadership Development:\n●                     We build leaders within our program. The Youth Affiliates are encouraged to hold positions within their meetings (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer), and we make sure they help plan their outings/events.\n●                     Participation in the youth affiliate group means that they must attend conferences on the local, state, and regional level.\n• Community Service\n●                     We provide community service opportunities that are in alignment with Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated’s programmatic thrust.\n●                     The community service they participate in allows them to exhibit their leadership skills and fosters an awareness for the community around them.\n●                     Community service days gives our girls safe and productive ways to socialize and spend their time.\n●                     One service activity they were extremely proud of this year was donating over 600 toiletries to Choices Shelter.\n \nThe Thiossane Institute was formed with the express purpose of bringing authentic West African cultural representation to a variety of local, national, and international communities. Thiossane introduces the richness of West African culture through dance and music to create a space of learning and growth in traditional African culture.\n \nThe Ready Set, G.R.O.W. program will focus on pathways that will provide resources of learning for quality instructional training to address job readiness, financial sustainability, and physical health and wellness. Research shows that interpersonal connections, knowledge, and information support positive youth outcomes, school retention, and delayed parenthood. Program sessions will focus on an educational component to learn grounded principle for adult readiness. \n \nActions that Matter For Youth, is a non-profit that focuses on providing educational services for youth that are economically and academically disadvantaged specifically on out of school time services for middle and high school students. The organization is a combination of programs that serve the community through youth development, financial literacy, life skills, social/emotional and challenges within the society.\n \nThrough The Power within her C.R.OW.N. Initiative, young ladies will gain skill set to enhance their sense of Confidence, Responsibility, Opportunity, Worth and Natural Beauty.  By focusing on grade levels 5th-9th, The Power within her C.R.O.W.N curriculum will be implemented as an enrichment program that will take place both during and after-school. Utilizing newly developed partnerships with Woodward Park MS, Walden JRHS and Medina MS, program implementation will take place within each building. To provide a small group setting, 6-12 young ladies per grade level will be selected/referred to participate per school.\n \nThe Ohio State University School of Social Work established a program creating opportunities for healing with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers. This project builds Phase I that was funded in June2021 based on an existing partnership with the CCC and FCJC to provide services for local Black girls who are justice-involved and their parents/caregivers. The project will also be led by Dr. Camille R. Quinn, a licensed independent social worker in Ohio and Assistant Professor at the OSU CSW. Her work draws on over 20 years of prior experience in social and health services as a practitioner and administrator.\n \nThe targeted constituents include court-involved Black girls aged 14-17 who are also disproportionality affected by PTSD, with 70% of girls with histories of sexual or physical abuse as well as their parents/caregivers. The parent/caregiver-child dyads (N=5 dyads) will undergo a stress reduction intervention, i.e., Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) that shows promise for addressing PTSD in other populations except this population. MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology, which is linked to delinquency and other risky behaviors. MBSR may help modulate the dysregulated stress response in the body to improve physical and mental health concurrently.\n \nBumblebeez is a non-profit mentoring program for African-American girls ages 10-13 years of age.  Its purpose is to provide young ladies with resources and information to combat the many social and emotional issues girls face daily. Bumblebeez operates over a ten-month period, January through October, called a cycle.  As they matriculate through the program, they are identified as Worker Bees (wearing pink tee-shirts). We celebrate the young ladies’ completion of their cycle with a graduation where family, friends, and community partners are invited to attend and support the girls as they are promoted to Bumblebees. Among their graduation gifts, they receive their highly anticipated yellow t-shirt.  We have identified the following topics as key areas of importance which Black girls should be familiar with on a surface level in order to become the best versions of themselves.\n \nPhysicians CareConnection, an affiliate of the Columbus Medical Association, is a volunteer-based, charitable organization that helps coordinate care for vulnerable adults in Central Ohio.
