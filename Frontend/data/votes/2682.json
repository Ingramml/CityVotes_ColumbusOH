    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe following ordinance authorizes additional funding to acquire the various property rights necessary to complete the Roadway Improvements-Sinclair Road Sidewalks in Community Planning Area 35, Northland.\n \nThe City of Columbus Department of Public Service is engaged in the Roadway Improvement-Sinclair Road Sidewalks project. This project consists of the construction of a seven-foot wide new sidewalk adjacent to the existing curb along both sides of Sinclair Road from Morse Road to just south of Bill Moose Run. A five-foot wide new sidewalk with a three-foot wide tree lawn within the limits of the previous culvert replacement project will also be included in the project. Additionally, a five-foot wide sidewalk will extend from just north of Bill Moose Run to a point north at the Strimple Avenue and Sinclair Road intersection. The improvements also involve traffic signal updates at Strimple Avenue and Sinclair Road. \n \nOrdinance 1849-2018 authorized the City Attorney’s Office to hire professional services and to negotiate with property owners to acquire the various property rights necessary to complete the Roadway Improvements-Sinclair Road Sidewalks project.  Funding in the amount of $125,000.00 was established to begin acquiring the needed property rights.  This ordinance is for additional funding in the amount of $50,000 to acquire right of way needed for the new sidewalk installation.\n \nThe Department of Public Service is currently finalizing construction plans and is prepared to authorize right-of-way acquisition pending passage of this funding legislation.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $50,000.00 is available for this project in the Morse Road TIF Fund, Fund 7414. It is necessary to transfer cash between project accounts within Fund 7414 from the Morse Road TIF project account to the Roadway Improvements - Sinclair Road Sidewalks project account to align spending in the proper project. Funds will also need to be appropriated and authorized for expenditure after transferring to the proper project.  \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide necessary right-of-way acquisition funding and prevent unnecessary delays to improving pedestrian safety within the Department of Public Service’s Programs. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of cash within the Morse Road TIF Fund; to appropriate funds within the Roadway Improvements - Sinclair Road Sidewalks; to authorize the City Attorney's Office, Real Estate Division, to contract for professional services relative to the acquisition of fee simple title and lesser interests in and to property needed for the project; to authorize the City Attorney's Office, Real Estate Division, to negotiate with property owners to acquire the additional rights of way necessary to complete this project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $50,000.00 from the Morse Road TIF Fund to pay for the right-of-way acquisitions; and to declare an emergency.
