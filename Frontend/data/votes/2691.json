    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance is to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Midstates Recreation for the 2020 CDBG Linden Early Childhood Development Playground Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized is $30,000.00, making a new aggregate total of $393,207.50 for this project. The funding for the original contract was provided by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) in accordance with the 2020 Annual Action Plan as approved by Council, however, this modification is being funded by the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund. \n \nThe improvements to the Linden Park Playground adjacent to the Linden Park Early Childhood Education Center is focused upon providing safe and accessible play opportunities for children of all abilities in the Linden Park educational curriculum as well as those throughout the community. This new playground will exceed current accessibility standards with updated rubberized safety surfacing and adaptive play equipment.  The play equipment design is state of the art with ground level play interaction encouraging universal accessibility and cooperative play.  \n \nThe requested modification for Midstates Recreation is $30,000.00 and is a direct result of site changes during the construction of the Linden Community Center. These changes resulted in a redesign of playground foundations to accommodate new utilities in this area that were not foreseen when this project was initially designed and awarded.  Additional coordination with the adjacent Linden Park School also resulted in increased quantities of the perimeter fencing of the playground. Initiating another procurement process for the services is not viable as the Department was already in contract with Midstates Recreation for this work.  This fee was calculated by the cost of time, materials, and labor needed to complete the playground construction using rates already established in the contract.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMidstates Recreation\n 5828 Zarley Street, Suite B, New Albany, Ohio 43054\nJohn Hobson (614) 855-3790                                                 \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 000552, 11-3732875\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 7, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the project to be closed out by the end of the year. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Safe and accessible playgrounds are one of the core charges of the Recreation and Parks Department. The Department monitors the life span of play spaces routinely to make sure that safe, quality equipment is provided to the public. \n \nArea(s) Affected: North Linden (40), South Linden (45)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Recreation and Parks Departments’ Master Plan by providing one of the top needs of the community, which are improvements to neighborhood parks that provide opportunities for fitness and wellness.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $363,207.50 was legislated for the 2020 CDBG Linden Early Childhood Development Playground Improvements Project by Ordinance 2053-2020.
