    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the establishment of an Auditor’s Certificate to allow payments to be made to railroad companies, or companies subcontracted by railroad companies, for work they have performed on Department of Public Service projects, and authorizes the Director of Public Service to use the Auditor’s Certificate to pay those charges.\nThe Department of Public Service administers and manages capital improvement projects within the public right-of-way, including resurfacing, roadway reconstruction, bridge rehabilitation and replacement, bikeway paths, sidewalks, and other transportation related projects.  On occasion, the successful completion of those efforts requires work to be performed on or near railroad property or facilities.   Railroad companies will not allow others to perform work on their property or facilities.  They perform the required work and charge the Department of Public Service for this work.  When it is known work will be required on railroad property or facilities in advance of the project starting, Public Service contracts with the railroad and encumbers funds to pay for the work.  These contracted amounts are estimates provided by the railroads.  Public Service is responsible for paying any expenses that exceed the estimates provided by the railroad companies.  In addition, there are occasions when work needs to be performed on or near railroad facilities on an emergency basis or that was not anticipated to be needed when a project was planned and designed.  Projects then get delayed while contracts get put in place or modified and the funding is legislated.\nTo prevent these delays, the Department of Public Service would like to put in place an Auditor’s Certificate encumbering funds in the amount of $150,000.00 to allow payments to be made to railroad companies for these miscellaneous expenses.  For several years City Council has been approving the establishment of Auditor’s Certificates for similar dollar amounts for the Department of Public Service to use for utility relocations, acquiring right-of-way, and paying for construction inspection to prevent the delay of construction projects when small amounts of additional funding are unexpectedly needed for a project for those purposes.  The railroad funds would be used in a similar manner.  . \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $150,000.00 is available for this project within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient budget authority for the establishment of the Auditor’s Certificate.  A transfer of funds and appropriation between projects within Fund 7704 is required to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order for the funds to be available to prevent construction delays as soon as possible.\nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate for the purpose of encumbering funds to be used to pay railroad charges; to authorize the expenditure of up to $150,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to pay railroad charges; and to declare an emergency.  ($150,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service administers and manages capital improvement projects within the public right-of-way, including resurfacing, roadway reconstruction, bridge rehabilitation and replacement, bikeway paths, sidewalks, and other transportation related projects; and \nWHEREAS, on occasion, the successful completion of those efforts requires work to be performed on or near railroad facilities; and\nWHEREAS, railroad companies will not allow other organizations to do this work, and they charge the Department of Public Service for work performed; and  \nWHEREAS, sometimes the work performed exceeds the estimated amount, or emergency work must be performed, or work on or near railroad property and facilities was not anticipated to be needed prior to the project starting; and\nWHEREAS, the establishment of an Auditor’s Certificate encumbering funds to pay for these unexpected costs would prevent delays in construction projects; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient budget authority for the establishment of this Auditor’s Certificate; and \nWHEREAS, cash and appropriation mist be transferred between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to align cash and appropriation with the proper project for this encumbrance; and \nWHEREAS, the Director of Public Service must be authorized to pay miscellaneous charges from railroad companies or their subcontractors against the Auditor’s Certificate; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to establish an Auditor’s Certificate for the purpose of encumbering funds to be used to pay railroad charges in order for the funds to be available to prevent construction delays as soon as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare;
