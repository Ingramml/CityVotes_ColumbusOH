    "description": "Explanation1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and to accept grant funds from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, through the Community Waste Reduction Grant.\n \nThe City of Columbus is requesting $35,000.00 from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio to help fund a pilot program to begin recycling collection at multi-family complexes to determine the feasibility and viability of a recycling program for these multi-family complexes. In addition to this grant, the City of Columbus will collaborate with the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio to request additional funding from The Recycling Partnership. The City has already begun to work with the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio and The Recycling Partnership and their staff to integrate funding into this project, and Columbus staff have already advised Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio staff that some of the funding and schedule assumptions in this application may change based on availability of funding provided by The Recycling Partnership. The City estimates the pilot will cost approximately $204,622.80, so the funding the City is seeking from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio accounts for 17.10% of the total estimated project cost.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to accept grant funds from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, to execute those documents necessary to accept the grant, to administer the grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of that award, and to refund any unused funds to grantor after the grant period ends if final accounting determines a refund is owed.  A separate ordinance will be submitted to Council to expend awarded grant funds and to encumber and expend necessary matching City funds.  \n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTGrant funding will be allocated to partially support funding of the pilot program for recycling collection at specified multi-family complexes. \n3.  FISCAL IMPACTPursuant to the terms and conditions of the grants, the Department of Public Service will be responsible for providing a 25% match required by the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio grants funds. The local match will be provided by use and dedication of one front-loading refuse truck and driver. The approximate cost for the vehicle operation costs, and driver’s salary and benefits over the six-month pilot would be $69,622.80. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATIONEmergency action is requested to allow for the execution of necessary grant documents and the acceptance and receipt of grant funding from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio in accordance with the conditions of that award as soon as possible.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with, and to accept grant funding in the amount of up to $35,000.00 from, the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, through the Community Waste Reduction Grant program; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio is offering $35,000.00 in grant funding to assist in covering costs associated with the Family Complex Recycling pilot program, administered by the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute documents, and any amendments and modifications thereto as may be necessary, with and to accept awarded grant funding from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, for the stated purpose; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists within the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to execute the necessary grant documents and the acceptance and receipt of grant funding from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio in accordance with the conditions of that award as soon as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to execute documents, and  any amendments and modifications thereto as may be necessary, with the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio to effectuate the acceptance of awarded grant funding from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio for the purpose of supporting the Family Complex pilot program. \n \nSECTION 2.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
