    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Board of Health to extend the Focus Hepatitis C grant from Gilead Sciences, Inc. for the period of 7/1/2020 to 3/31/2022. As per Ordinance # 1575-2020, Columbus Public Health was awarded a grant from Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Ordinance # 2172-2021 extended the grant through September 31, 2021.  The FOCUS Hep C program will allow Columbus Public Health (CPH) to seek to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with Hepatitis C. Additional Hepatitis C screening will be made available through the Sexual Health and Alcohol and Other Drug programs. Persons who screen positive for Hepatitis C through these programs will be referred to a Linkage to Care Specialist.  The client will be assessed for current health insurance status and enrolled in any available programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The client will be assessed for readiness to be linked to care. Persons ready will be referred to available infectious disease specialists.\n \nThe Grant Number of G502035 will remain the same. The grant period was previously 7/1/2020 to 6/30/2021, had been extended to 9/30/2021, and is now being extended through March 31, 2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no fiscal impact as this is only to extend the award period.  The amount of the grant will remain the same.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to extend the grant agreement term of the Focus Hepatitis C Grant Program for the period of 7/1/2020 to 3/31/2022; and to declare an emergency.
