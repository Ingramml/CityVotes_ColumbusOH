    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  To maintain unemployment benefit payments in accordance with Federal Law, appropriation is necessary for the unemployment compensation program.  To determine the amount necessary for the appropriation, current utilization and anticipated claims were analyzed.\n \nEmergency action is requested to ensure the unemployment compensation program is able to commence as soon as contractually possible, thereby maintaining continuity of service.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   Unemployment expense was higher than normal due to the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Actual expense in 2020 was $728,000, but due to the CaresAct Funding through the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services only $283,000 was realized. In 2021, actual expense for January through November was $583,000 with $257,000 actually realized due to the CaresAct funding noted above and the American Rescue Plan Act. A total of $600,000 is projected to be needed for 2022 as the American Rescue Plan Act, as it relates to unemployment, only allows credits through the week of September 4, 2021 claims. Sufficient funds are available in the Employee Benefits Fund 5502 for this expense. \n \nAppropriation is being made to the following program:\n \nEmployee Unemployment Compensation Program:  $600,000\n \nTitle\nTo make appropriations from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 for the funding of the Unemployment Compensation Program; to authorize the expenditure of $600,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary; and to declare an emergency.
