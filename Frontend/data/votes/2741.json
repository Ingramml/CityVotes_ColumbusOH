The funding for the projects total $2,485,108.11 from ADAMH and begins January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022.   \n \nThe Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) grant contract is primarily funded through the ADAMH Board of Franklin County but also generates the following revenues which are to be appropriated; client fees in the amount of $219,925.00 and Medicaid in the amount of $275,471.00 for a total appropriation of $2,980,504.11.  These funds will enable Columbus Public Health to continue to provide treatment, counseling and prevention services to men, women, children/families, homeless population and to serve clients referred by the criminal justice system.\n \nThe Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Prevention Program will serve approximately 5,206 unique clients, who may receive multiple services, through Columbus City Schools, After School/Summer programs, Latina Prevention programming, HIV/Early Intervention sites, Parenting classes, and Recreation Centers. Of this number, approximately 2,200 adults and family members will be served; 2,066 children and adolescents through youth programming; and 940 transitional age youth will be served through youth mentoring, workforce development and programming. The ADS Comprehensive Treatment Program will provide treatment services to approximately 1024 men and women through the provision of Biopsychosocial Assessments, Individual, Intensive Outpatient and Outpatient counseling. Due to the ongoing Pandemic and the increased number of clients being out due to illness our projections may change throughout the year. 59% of the population to be served are men and 41% will be women. The Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program is projected to serve 40 unique clients who will be prescribed Suboxone, Sublocade or Vivitrol. Additional clients needing MAT services may be served through our collaboration with a partner agency.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible to maintain the clients' continuity of care. Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.   \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) grant is primarily funded through the ADAMH Board of Franklin County.
