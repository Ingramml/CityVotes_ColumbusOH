    "description": "Title\n \nTo declare February 2022 as American Heart Month and recognize cardiovascular disease as the world’s leading cause of preventable death. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, cardiovascular disease affects men, women, and children of every age and race in the United States (U.S.); from 2019-2020, deaths from heart disease increased by 4.8%, the largest increase in heart disease deaths since 2012, and stroke deaths increased in the same period by 6%; cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S, and\n \nWHEREAS, in 2015, cardiovascular disease accounted for $555,000,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost productivity, and by 2035, cardiovascular disease will account for $1,093,900,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost productivity annually; and\n \nWHEREAS, the global COVID-19 disease pandemic poses significantly high risk to individuals with COVID and risk factors; and\n \nWHEREAS, individuals in the U.S. have made great progress in reducing the death rate for cardiovascular disease, but this progress has been more modest with respect to the death rate for cardiovascular disease in women and minorities; and\n \nWHEREAS, cardiovascular diseases are the number one killer of women in the U.S., killing more women than all forms of cancer combined; and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of maternal death in the U.S., or more simply put, heart disease is the No. 1 killer of new moms; and\n \nWHEREAS, women, especially Black and Hispanic women, are disproportionably impacted by heart disease and stroke and research shows heart attacks are on the rise in younger women. Yet younger generations of women, Gen Z and Millennial's, are less likely to be aware of their greatest health threat, including knowing the warning signs of heart attacks and strokes, and\n \nNOW, THEREFORE, Council does hereby recognize the importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease, and proclaim February 2022 to be American Heart Month in Columbus, Ohio. By increasing awareness, speaking out about heart disease, and empowering others to reduce their risk for cardiovascular diseases, we can save thousands of lives each year. \n \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: \n \nThat this Council urges Columbus residents to wear red in recognition of family, friends, and neighbors who have suffered from heart disease to show support for women and cardiovascular health.",
