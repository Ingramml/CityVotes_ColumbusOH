Waiters was born to his Father, Robert Waiters, and Mother Frances Waiters on January 8, 1961. He grew up on the East side of Columbus and quickly stood out in the community due to his great height, skill on the basketball court, and kind soul; and\n \nWHEREAS, During his time on the East High School Men’s Basketball team, Granville Waiters led the team to the 1979 Class AAA state title.
