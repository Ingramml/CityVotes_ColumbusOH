    "title": "To resolve to support Franklin County, in partnership with Thrive Companies, in their efforts to obtain Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation grant funding for use in the environmental cleanup and redevelopment of the former Buckeye Auto Parts auto salvage and dump at 2474 McKinley Avenue; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this resolution is to support Franklin County, in partnership with Thrive Companies, in conjunction with an Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation round 1 grant application of up to $10 million for site cleanup at the former Buckeye Auto Parts auto salvage and dump along the Scioto River and located at 2474 McKinley Avenue in Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio.\n \nThe property contains auto salvage and storage facilities on 50.5 acres of land identified by seven Franklin County parcel identification numbers: 010-146234, 010-146253, 010-200913, 010-146278, 010-104705, 010-200912, and 010-104706.\n \nHistorical information indicated houses, a quarry, and a landfill have previously occupied parts of the property.  Buckeye Auto Parts has occupied the property since at least the late 1970’s.  Ohio EPA records identified the property included the former Huston Landfill (a.k.a. McKinley Avenue Dump) that accepted municipal, construction and industrial wastes from the 1950s to the 1970s.  The City of Columbus owned part of the property used as the landfill.\n \nPhase I and Phase II environmental assessments have been completed on the property and indicate the need to clear and grade the site in order to install a clan soil cover or other engineered controls over the former landfill and junkyard to prevent exposure to hazardous substances and petroleum.\n \nThrive Companies is proposing a new mixed-use development, Westbend, that will include a 12-acre public park, open spaces, and access launch points to the river.  By connecting more people to nature and natural resources, Westbend hopes to cultivate an area for residents and guests to live, work and play.\n \nEmergency legislation is necessary in order to meet Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation round 1 grant application deadline of January 31, 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There are no costs to the City of Columbus associated with a resolution of support for the Brownfield Remediation Program grant funding.\n \nTitle\nTo resolve to support Franklin County, in partnership with Thrive Companies, in their efforts to obtain Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation grant funding for use in the environmental cleanup and redevelopment of the former Buckeye Auto Parts auto salvage and dump at 2474 McKinley Avenue; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS,  the State of Ohio Brownfield Remediation grant program will award up to $10 million per project throughout Ohio for the purpose of cleanup, demolition and redevelopment of contaminated or abandoned properties known as “brownfields”; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus contains brownfield properties which may qualify for Brownfield Remediation cleanup, demolition and redevelopment grant funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Department of Development has been involved with brownfield redevelopment since 1999, first with the Clean Ohio grant program and now with the Ohio Brownfield Remediation grant program; and\n \nWHEREAS,  Ohio Brownfield Remediation grant funding will greatly complement the efforts of the Columbus Department of Development in helping to clean up and redevelop brownfield properties in Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Department of Development has identified a brownfield property in the City of Columbus which may be eligible for Ohio Brownfield Remediation grant funding at the site formerly known as the Buckeye Auto Parts auto salvage and dump and the Thrive Companies has agreed to partner with Franklin County to clean up and redevelop the site as a mixed use development with substantial park space along the Scioto River; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to express its support for the application described herein to meet the Ohio Brownfield Remediation grant application deadline of January 31, 2022, all for the preservation of public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; Now, Therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.                     That the Columbus City Council hereby supports Franklin County, in partnership with Thrive Companies, in their efforts to obtain Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation round 1 grant funding for the purpose of incentivizing the cleanup and redevelopment of the former Buckeye Auto Parts salvage and dump site.\n \nSection 2.                     That for the reason stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this resolution is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its adoption and approval by the Mayor or ten days after adoption if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
