    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify a contract with Continental Office to replace the flooring at the 911 Emergency Communications Center.  Ordinance 2076-2020 authorized the original contract with Continental Office to provide services and material to remove and replace older worn out flooring at various locations within the Divisions of Police and Fire.  This ordinance seeks authority to modify this contract in order to add materials and services to remove and replace the flooring at the 911 Emergency Communications Center.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NO:  CC006118 expires January 11, 2024.  \n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $41,948.92 within the Public Safety Capital Improvement Budget for the removal and installation of flooring by Continental Office.  This ordinance also authorizes a transfer of funds between projects within the 2021 Public Safety Capital Improvement Budget.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  These renovations, for the 911 Emergency Communications Center, are improvements that are immediately needed due to the overall conditions in the facility, and to resolve flooring safety issues.  In addition, the lead time for many renovation type items is already unusually long given the pandemic and supply chain constraints.  To delay the contract an additional 30 days will unnecessarily further delay these much needed improvements.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify a contract with Continental Office for the removal and installation of flooring within the 911 Emergency Communications Center; to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer between divisions and projects within the Public Safety Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $41,948.92 from the Public Safety Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($41,948.92)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need to modify a contract with Continental Office for the removal and installation of flooring within the 911 Emergency Communications Center; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the facilities within the 911 Emergency Communications Center are in need of new flooring as the current flooring is worn and has become a potential safety issue; and,\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need to amend the 2021 Public Safety Capital Improvement Budget and to authorize a transfer of funds between divisions and projects; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Continental Office has the experience and expertise to provide such services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract with Continental Office was entered into pursuant to a State of Ohio Cooperative Contract available for use by the City on the State Term Schedule; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual and daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the contract with Continental Office for the removal and installation of flooring within the Department of Public Safety to resolve flooring safety issues.  These renovations, for the 911 Emergency Communications Center, are improvements that are immediately needed due to the overall conditions in the facility and unusually long lead times for construction projects, so as to allow the Division of Facilities Management to begin the renovation project without delay, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
