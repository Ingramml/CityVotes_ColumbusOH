Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2020 - 2022 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 0506-2020.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multiyear contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2020-2022) timeframe.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Resource International and the Divisions of Water and Sewerage and Drainage.\n \n2.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency and valves that are inoperable.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss. The Neighborhood Liaison(s) will be contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage projects include rehabilitation of existing sewers, repair to existing sewers, construction of new sewers, and construction of green infrastructure.  The majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues.\n \n3.0 FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  The Department anticipates requesting additional future modifications to this contract as new construction projects begin during 2022.\n \n4.0 CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: 31-0669793 | Exp. 1/23/22 | WBE | DAX #4197\n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  A transfer of funds within the Water G.O.
