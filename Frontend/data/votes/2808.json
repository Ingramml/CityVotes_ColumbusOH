    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify Agreement PO-265488 with Community Shelter Board by extending the agreement termination date from January 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: Ordinance 0387-2021, passed March 8, 2021, authorized the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) for the purpose of continuing the City’s support for men, women and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness in Columbus.  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify Agreement PO-265488 with Community Shelter Board by extending the agreement termination date from January 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022. This extension will allow the CSB to fully spend down funds which are providing access to shelter and housing to men, women, and families experiencing homelessness. \n \nA component of the scope of work uses funds dedicated to homeless pregnant women served in rapid rehousing. These funds will not be fully spent down by January 31, 2022. With the addition of the Housing for Pregnant Women Celebrate One program, more women are caught at the homelessness prevention stage, which is great outcome. In addition, for homeless pregnant women enrolled in rapid rehousing, finding affordable housing may take a very long time, which then delays the use of allocated funds. Additional time is needed in order to spend down the grant funds. \n \nEmergency action is requested so that program activities can continue and be completed without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are needed for this modification.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify Agreement PO-265488 with Community Shelter Board by extending the agreement termination date from January 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to modify Agreement PO-265488 with Community Shelter Board by extending the agreement termination date from January 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification supports the purpose of the Community Shelter Board providing access to shelter and housing to men, women and families experiencing homelessness.; and\n \nWHEREAS, no additional funds are needed to modify this agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the agreement with Community Shelter Board so that program activities can continue and be completed without interruption, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify Agreement PO-265488 with Community Shelter Board by extending the agreement termination date from January 31, 2022 to June 30, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to agreement modifications.  \n \nSECTION 3.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
