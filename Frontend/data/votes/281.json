    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes CelebrateOne on behalf of the Office of the Mayor to accept, appropriate and expend $50,000.00 in funding from a Disparities in Maternal Health grant from the Ohio Department of Health and to expend $3,400 in private funding from The Columbus Foundation.  These funds will be used to enter into contract with Design Impact (DI) to develop and implement a human-centered design process that engages community members impacted by infant and maternal morbidity and mortality as experts and co-creators in the process.\n \nThe project will unfold in three phases. The first phase involves establishing a core team and aligning its members around the goals of this work, participant roles and responsibilities, and the project's timeline. Additionally, DI will plan, design, and facilitate training sessions for as many as 6 peer researchers recruited by CelebrateOne. The peer researchers are a group of pregnant and parenting individuals which geographically and demographically represent families most impacted by infant and maternal morbidity and mortality. \n \nThe second phase will include the development of a guide to be used by the peer researchers during listening sessions and support from DI in facilitating these sessions. Following each session, DI will meet with CelebrateOne staff and the peer researchers to debrief and process what had been shared and learned. Once all four listening sessions have been completed, DI will synthesize and analyze the raw data gathered through the listening session and will create a draft report for C1, which explains key themes and opportunities based upon the analysis of the data.\n \nThe third and final phase of this project will include the design and facilitation of a strategic conversation among CelebrateOne partners. This session will engage stakeholders including: parents, health care professionals, and representatives from other related social services and government agencies. DI will move participants through a collaborative process geared toward identifying promising opportunities based on the lessons learned from the community listening sessions. The goal of this session is for stakeholders to move toward action around access to prenatal, perinatal, and postpartum care. \n \nEmergency action is requested to allow planning work to begin at the earliest time available.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $53,400.00. $50,000.00 is part of an Ohio Department of Health Disparities in Maternal Health grant, General Government Grant Fund 2220, Grant Number G402102, while $3,400.00 is from the Private Grant Fund 2291, The Columbus Foundation, G401901. \n \n Title\nTo authorize CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to accept and appropriate funding from a Disparities in Maternal Health grant provided by the Ohio Department of Health; to authorize the Executive Director of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to enter into contract with Design Impact to develop and implement a human-centered design process; to authorize the expenditure of $53,400.00 from the General Government Grant Fund 2220 and $3,400.00 from the Private Grant Fund 2291; and to declare an emergency.
