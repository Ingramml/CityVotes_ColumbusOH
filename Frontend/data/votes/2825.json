appropriation, it is understood that this Council is not making specific appropriations for each item of every classification hereinbefore contained but only for the total for each department and subdepartment, as shown in the final column.  The itemized classification shall, however, constitute limitations on the powers of the several department heads as granted in Section 22 and no such officer shall make any expenditure for any other purpose in any amount beyond that of the particular classification; provided, however, that transfers may be made from one object class to another, within any one department or division.  Transfers of sums exceeding $100,000.00 shall be authorized only by ordinance of Council.  Transfers of sums of $100,000.00 or less shall only be approved pursuant to a letter over the signatures of the head of the department, the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, the City Auditor, and the Chairperson of the Committee of Finance. \nSECTION 25.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to pay obligations of various departments pertaining to preceding years’ obligations from current appropriations up to a maximum of $25,000.00 per obligation.  \nSECTION 26.  That in the last month of the fiscal year, the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer appropriations within any fund, if necessary, and to cancel encumbrances, if necessary, to provide for City payrolls, unpaid internal services, tax adjustments, and other obligations from any object level one with available appropriations to the appropriate object level one.\n \nSECTION 27.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
