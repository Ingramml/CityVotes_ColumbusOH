    "description": "Explanation\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Community Development for All People for its Warming Center.\n \nCommunity Development for All People holds overnight warming centers at 946 Parsons Avenue due to the extreme cold affecting Columbus during the winter months. They provide a place for anyone to warm up and stay overnight. These funds will support five weeks of the Warming Center and support utilities, laundry, bus passes, and other operational costs.                     \n \nA warming center is a short-term emergency shelter that operates when temperatures or a combination of precipitation, wind chill, wind and temperature become dangerously inclement. Their purpose is the prevention of death and injury from exposure to the elements. Warming centers are frequently used by residents experiencing homelessness. Centers also serve stranded motorists or, during cold-weather power outages, homeowners and tenants.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in supporting the Community Development for All People which helps those living in poverty meet some of their essential needs.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Columbus City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community Development for All People for its Warming Center; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
