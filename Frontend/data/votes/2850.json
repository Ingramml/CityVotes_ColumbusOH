With the decommissioning of the OS, DPS desires to move this model to the Etch platform which currently hosts the Multimodal Trip Planning Application (MMTPA), Pivot. \n \nPursuant to Ordinance 2864-2018, the Smart City Program Management Office initiated a procurement effort that resulted in the award and execution of a professional services contract with Etch in the amount of up to $900,000.00 for the purchase of a new application environment for the execution of multimodal transportation, known as the Multimodal Trip Planning Application (MMTPA) for end to end (door to door) multimodal trip execution.  Ordinance 0112-2020 authorized the Chief Innovation Officer to modify the contract in the amount of $250,000.00.  Ordinance 0228-2021 authorized the Chief Innovation Officer to modify the contract in the amount of $200,000.00.  This ordinance authorizes the Chief Innovation Officer to further modify the contract in the amount of $44,220.00.\n \nOrdinance 0990-2021 authorized the assignment of all past, present and future business done by the City of Columbus to reflect the change of the company name from MTECH Solutions, LLC to Etch Solutions, LLC.  \n \nThe purpose of this contract modification is to add funding and scope to the original contract.   The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service (DPS) utilizes a parking prediction model that resides on the existing Operating System (OS).
