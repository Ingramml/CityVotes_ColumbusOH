    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with George J. Igel and Company, Inc. for the construction of Confluence Village Park. The contract amount is $940,155.73, with a contingency of $188,030.00, for a total of $1,128,185.73. An additional $94,015.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,222,200.73 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nFor several years, the planned redevelopment around the west end of Nationwide Blvd. has envisioned a park space along the east bank of the Olentangy River. This three-acre park construction contract will provide a complete reconstruction of the Olentangy River Boat Ramp and build walks, benches, lighting, and improvements along the east bank of the river. Additional contingency funds have been added to the project total due to the potential of contaminated on site soils that may be required to be specially handled and hauled off site. This project will benefit hundreds of residents and employees of the new Confluence Village development, as well as thousands of visitors to the new Crew Stadium, both of which will be adjacent to this park. This contract will enable building the park concurrently with construction of Recreation and Parks Department’s Olentangy Trail Arena District Connector Bridge.  This project coincides with the completion of the new Crew stadium and bridge in the summer of 2021, as well as the private multi-use developments surrounding Confluence Village. The construction project is anticipated to start in late February 2021, with work substantially complete by September 2021. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on November 23, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on December 14, 2020. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nGeorge J. Igel Co. (MAJ): $940,155.73\nComplete General Construction (MAJ): $977,983.17\nKokosing Construction Co. (MAJ): $1,025,941.88\nFacemyer Company (MBE): $1,166,166.20\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that George J. Igel and Company, Inc. was the lowest and most responsive bidder. George J. Igel and Company, Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGeorge J. Igel Co. \n2040 Alum Creek Drive, Columbus, OH 43207\nMatt Check, (614) 246-2312                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006024, 31-4214570\nDecember 16, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the contractor can begin work in February 2021 and be substantially complete with the work by September 2021 to coincide with the timing of other major civic projects near Confluence Village scheduled to be completed around the same time. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Over 2 million people visit the Arena District each year. This number will increase significantly with the development of Confluence Village and Crew Stadium. The district contains major attractions, special events, employment centers, and rapidly expanding residential living. The Olentangy Trail travels along the west side of the river but thousands of trail users cannot ride, walk, run, or access the east side. The Confluence Village Park and Boat Ramp will provide a safe, attractive, accessible way to access the Olentangy and Scioto downtown waterways on both sides of the river.\n \nThe existing Olentangy Boat Ramp was built in the 1970’s and is unsafe due to flood damage. It has been in disrepair for several years.  The new ramp will be made easily accessible for kayakers, canoeists, and emergency services to the 14 mile Olentangy Water Trail and the Scioto Mile.  The proposed park space will convert a former asphalt parking lot into a vibrant, small scale riverfront park with access to kayaks, bikes, and walking paths along a scenic downtown stretch of the Olentangy River.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: For several years the Department has received many inquiries regarding better trail access to Confluence Village as well as an expressed strong desire to improve the riverfront and the Olentangy Boat Ramp for kayaking and canoeing.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Downtown (55), All trail users, nearby special events and Crew Stadium attendees, and nearby development will all benefit from this project\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving recreation opportunities as well as access to trails and greenways corridors.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,222,200.73 is budgeted and available from and within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.  Ordinance is contingent on the deposit of the 2021 bond sale proceeds.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with George J.
