    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC dba Homewood Suites for funds, up to $50,000.00, to provide hotel services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazzard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide hotel services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2019 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus program. Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with one bidder under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19. The original contract was PO220351, ORD 2723-2020 and expired December 31, 2021.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The fee for services in the new contract term will be the same as that of the original contract and authorize the payment of expenses starting January 1, 2022 ending December 31, 2022.  Barring unforeseen circumstanced, the Director anticipates submitting future legislation to renew this contract annually until the end of the HUD grant and, if necessary, modifying the contract in the interim to add additional funds.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue program services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the fund 2220 grant G441900 for this purpose.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 031229 and expires 02/19/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC, dba Homewood Suites, for an additional year to provide hotel services to the Lead Safe Columbus program and to increase the contract amount up to $50,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $50,000.00 in the General Government Grant Fund; declare an emergency.
