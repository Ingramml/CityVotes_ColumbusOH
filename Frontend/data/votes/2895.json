    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Auditor to create a new sub fund within the City’s Special Purpose Fund to account for the activities of the Columbus Public Health Donation Program.  The current existing cash and appropriation will be transferred to the newly established fund from Grant No. 508252.\n \nG508252, Active Living Grant, was established 6/24/2008 to allow for donated funding received from the Columbus Foundation Endowment to be deposited and expended through the City of Columbus procurement process.  In order to properly track and account for these monies in a non-grant format, we are requesting that the City Auditor create a new sub fund within the City's Special Purpose Fund, Fund No. 2223.\n \nThe original creation of G508252 and all supporting documentation for the creation of this grant in no way restricts or directs those funds in a manner that prohibits the transfer of the balance to a newly created sub fund. \nThe Foundation for Active Living, a fund established at the Columbus Foundation by the City of Columbus, Ordinance 1210-2008, was established to accept corporate and private donations, and distribute funds to various organizations within the community for the benefit of Columbus Public Health, the Institute for Active Living, and other City programs.  \n \n2354-2018 requested a modification of the fund purpose to include all aspects of public health to protect, promote and monitor the overall health of the community.   \n1904-2021 requested a name change of the endowment fund from the Foundation for Active Living to the Foundation for Columbus Public Health.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Utilizing the City’s Special Purpose Fund provides the best means for properly tracking and accounting for these monies.\n \nAt the writing of this ordinance, there is $65,790.11 available in Grant No. 508252 for new appropriation to this newly established fund.  This ordinance will authorize the City Auditor to transfer the unencumbered cash balance of Grant No. 508252 to the City’s Special Purpose Fund and appropriate those monies to the Columbus Public Health Department for the continuation of Health Donation Program.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation of $65,790.11 from the unappropriated balance of the Columbus Public Health Grant Fund to the Columbus Public Health Special Purpose Fund for various services funded through donations;
