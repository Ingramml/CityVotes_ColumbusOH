    "description": "Explanation\n \n“Finn” a police horse that has been in service with the Division of Police’s Mounted Unit since 2017 needs to be retired and sold.\n \n“Finn” was recently diagnosed with caudal heel pain of his right front limb.  Finn will not be able to be shoed as necessary to perform duties as a police horse and the Division is requesting that the horse be retired and sold.
