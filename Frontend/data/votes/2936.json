    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.                     BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel Phase 1 & 2, CIP 650724-100000. Review of existing information, preliminary field investigations, preliminary geotechnical investigation and preliminary design report have been completed under the original contract.  \nA large portion of the detailed design, final geotechnical investigation, survey, and easement preparation were completed under Renewal No. 1.\n \nCompletion of detailed design, production of specifications and bidding related services was completed with Renewal No. 2.  \n \nContract Renewal No. 3 included engineering services during construction for the first year.  \n \nContract Renewal No. 4 will include the continuation of engineering services during construction for the second year.  There will be a renewal each year to continue these services.\n \nPlanning Area: the project is located within the Downtown, Near North/University and the West Olentangy community planning areas.\n \nRenewal Information:     \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $1,960,034.50\nOriginal Contract                     $5,488,356.00\nRenewal No. 1                     $5,402,729.00\nRenewal No. 2                     $5,482,693.30\nRenewal No. 3                     $1,979,602.00\nRenewal No. 4                     $1,960,034.50\nCURRENT PROPOSED TOTAL                                                               $20,313,414.80\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen.\nThis renewal was anticipated\n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nSubstantial information and knowledge has been developed by the consultant through work performed during the first three years of work on this engineering agreement.  If the work to be performed under this Renewal was to be bid out separately, tasks already completed would be performed repetitively causing significant delays and incurring additional cost.  Also delays would put the City at risk of missing consent order deadlines.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nA scope of services, consistent with the original proposal and contract, was developed and fee was negotiated between the City and consultant.\n \n2.                     PROJECT TIMELINE: Renewal No. 4 will fund construction services through 2022.\n \n3.                     EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time\n \n4.                     CONTRACT COMPIANCE NO: 31-1268980 | MBR | 2/28/2023 | Vendor # 004939\n \n5.   ECONOMIC IMPACT: The project was identified in the Integrated Plan and 2015 Wet Weather Management Plan (WWMP) Update Report which was developed with input from numerous stakeholder groups and submitted to the Ohio EPA.  The project will mitigate sewer overflows into the Olentangy River as described in the report. Short term economic impacts will be in terms of the prime and twelve sub consultants work on design of the project.\n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance requires the appropriation of, transfer within and the expenditure of up to $1,960,034.50 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116. It also authorizes an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget for the creation of sufficient authority for this project.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel Phase 1 & 2; to appropriate, transfer, and expend up to $1,960,034.50 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.
