    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The need exists to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with T. Marzetti Company (“Marzetti”). The Ohio Enterprise Zone law O.R.C. Section 5709.62(C) requires the City to enter into a Council-approved agreement between the City and participating companies.\n \nMarzetti is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Lancaster Colony Corporation, the parent company.  Marzetti produces numerous salad dressings, fruit and vegetable dips, frozen baked goods, and specialty brand items. It is the largest food and beverage company headquartered in Central Ohio. In 1896, Teresa Marzetti arrived in Columbus, Ohio from Florence and opened her small Italian restaurant. Marzetti’s Restaurant grew from a local favorite into a four-star restaurant known for its salad dressings. By 1955, the upstairs kitchen of the restaurant became a full-scale factory and Marzetti dressings could be found in grocery stores throughout Ohio.  In 1969, Lancaster Colony Corporation purchased Marzetti.  Lancaster Colony Corporation is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and food service markets. The company’s top brands include Marzetti®, New York Brand® Bakery, Sister Schubert’s® and Flatout.  \n \nMarzetti is proposing to invest a total project cost of approximately $18,000,000, which includes $5.4 million in real property improvements, $2.6 million in improvements to its existing facility, and $10 million in machinery and equipment to expand its current manufacturing facility by 17,000 square feet at 1709 Frank Road, Columbus, Ohio 43223, parcel number 570-126842 (“Project Site”).  With this expansion, Marzetti will be able to accommodate three new packaging lines and renovate interior portions of its existing facility.  The expansion would also address fire protection, storm water detention, parking, truck dock doors, shipping area improvements, ingredient and material storage, utility support and upgrades (electrical, water, gas, compressed air, refrigeration, and HVAC units). Additionally, Marzetti will retain 104 full-time jobs with an annual payroll of approximately $5,742,374 and create 20 net new full-time permanent positions with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $900,000 at the Project Site.\n                     \nMarzetti is requesting an Enterprise Zone property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years on real property improvements to assist in the proposed expansion project.\n \nThe South-Western School District has been advised of this project.  \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNo Funding is required for this legislation. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with T.
