    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThe City of Columbus, Columbus Public Health, receives funding for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The purpose of this grant is to improve access to quality medical care for persons with HIV or AIDS living in Central Ohio (Franklin, Licking, Delaware, Morrow, Union, Madison, Pickaway, and Fairfield counties). The goal is for each client to achieve viral suppression which improves their quality of life and reduces the risk of spreading the infection. In 2019, The Ryan White Part A program for the Central Ohio area served over 1,807 people living with HIV.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into and, if needed, modify contracts with the following vendors to provide HIV-related somatic and outpatient/ambulatory medical care, early intervention services, medical and non-medical case management services, medical transportation, mental health services, housing services, emergency financial assistance, and any other service allowable under the grant. The term of the contract with each qualified vendor is March 1, 2021, through February 28, 2022, with funding based on vendor estimates of annual funding requirements for allowable services. These services were advertised through vendor services RFQ010425 on August 25, 2018 and RFQ013649 on September 24, 2019, according to bidding requirements of the City Code.\n \nAIDS Healthcare Foundation FEID#95-4112121: $364,543.00                                                               \nEquitas Health FEID#31-1126780: $1,855,809.00                                                               \nThe Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital FEID#31-6056230: $453,817.00\nThe Ohio State University, Department of Internal Medicine FEID#31-6025986: $310,456.00 \nOhio State University Hospital FEID#31-1340739: $100,000.00\nTotal: $3,084,625.00\n  \nUnder the terms of the grant, funds must be used during the grant period or they are forfeited and CPH may be subject to penalties related to future grant funding.  Previously, CPH has reallocated unused funds from vendors through appropriate contract modifications.  These modifications oftentimes required additional legislation. Most recently, towards the goals of minimizing unused funds, maximizing available services, and avoiding funding penalties, HRSA has tasked CPH with improving the process by which unused funds are reallocated. Therefore, this ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with qualified vendors, modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds by entering into contracts with newly identified and qualified vendors without the need for additional legislation. As such, this ordinance requests a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329.  \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that quality medical care continues to be available to eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS and to ensure timely payment to providers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nContracts will be entered into by Columbus Public Health with vendors who meet federal requirements related to services allowable under the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program as well as comply with the RFQ and City bidding processes.  This ordinance will authorize one ACPO in the amount of $3,084,625.00 to encumber funds using available grant appropriations for contracts with vendors.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with qualified vendors, modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds by entering into contracts with newly identified and qualified vendors without the need for additional legislation for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio; to authorize the expenditure of $3,084,625.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; to waive competitive bidding of City Code Chapter 329; and to declare an emergency ($3,084,625.00). \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the city receives funding totaling $4,727,019.00 for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program (the Grant) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which requires Columbus Public Health (CPH) to assure quality medical care to eligible persons living with HIV or AIDS in Central Ohio;

and, \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the city to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to enter into contracts in order to continue services without interruption for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;  Now, therefore,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into contracts for a total amount not to exceed $3,084,625.00 for HIV-related services to persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio, for the period of March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022.\n \nAIDS Healthcare Foundation FEID#95-4112121: $364,543.00                                                               \nEquitas Health FEID#31-1126780: $1,855,809.00                                                               \nThe Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital FEID#31-6056230: $453,817.00\nThe Ohio State University, Department of Internal Medicine FEID#31-6025986: $310,456.00 \nOhio State University Hospital FEID#31-1340739: $100,000.00\nTotal: $3,084,625.00\n \nSECTION 2.                     That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds and enter into contracts with additional vendors that are newly identified by Columbus Public Health as qualified to provide the required services and that meet the federal grant requirements without the need for additional legislation, for services allowable under the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration.\n \nSECTION 3.                     That to pay the cost of said contracts, the expenditure of $3,084,625.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, object class 03 per the attached accounting document. \n \nSECTION 4.                     That Council finds it in the City’s best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329.\n \nSECTION 5.                     That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
