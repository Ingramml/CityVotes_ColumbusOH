    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, is currently engaged in a project identified as the Signals - Columbus Traffic Signal System Phase F project.  The Columbus Traffic Signals System projects migrate the existing Columbus Traffic Signal System to an open architecture that will serve central Ohio stakeholders with regional system connectivity and interoperability. Phase F will upgrade signal and communications infrastructure that will connect 213 signalized intersections and 6 proposed communications node sites with the updated Columbus Traffic Signals System central software and traffic management center.\n                                                                                                                                                                                             \nDuring the course of this project, a portion of real property owned by the City of Columbus known as 1385 East Fifth Avenue, Franklin County Parcel Number 010-033939, would need to be dedicated as right-of-way for roadway purposes to accommodate the improvements already completed by this project. Current plans indicate 0.112 acre will need to be dedicated for this purpose, to dedicate the property as road right-of-way and name the road right-of-way as Joyce Ave.  After review of the preliminary plan sheets, the Division of Water, the Department of Finance and Management and the Real Estate Management Office has determined the dedication of this property to right of way will not adversely affect the City and should be allowed to proceed.\n \nThe following legislation permits the City to dedicate the property as road right-of-way and name the road right-of-way as Joyce Ave.\n \n2.
