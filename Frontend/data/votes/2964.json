    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the transfer of $490,000 from the general fund to the specialty docket program.  The Specialized Docket consists of five programs, which address drug and alcohol addiction, heroin addiction, mental health issues, and the special needs of human trafficking victims and veterans.   \n \nThe Court operates five specialized dockets, which have been certified or are in the process of receiving certification from the Supreme Court of Ohio Commission on Specialized Dockets.  Each docket has received certification after submitting written materials and undergoing a site review to ensure that statewide, minimum standards are met.  The Specialized Dockets hold criminal offenders accountable while linking them with comprehensive treatment and services, which leads to a reduction in recidivism and an increase in community safety.\n \nIn April 2004, the Mental Health Program was created to better serve criminal defendants who are impacted by severe mental illness and who have pending cases before the Court.  \n \nIn 2009, the Changing Actions to Change Habits (CATCH) program was created to better serve criminal defendants who have been charged with misdemeanor solicitation, prostitution, and/or loitering to solicit.  The docket also serves people convicted of other crimes, which were committed while the participant was a victim of human trafficking.  Participants may have severe depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, or other mental illnesses and may be dependent on alcohol and/or drugs.  Because many of the participants have been the victims of human trafficking, CATCH focuses on the trauma experienced by participants.\n \nIn 2009, the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Program (ADAP) was created to better serve criminal defendants who are dependent on drugs and/or alcohol and who have pending legal issues before the Court.  In 2010, the Opiate Extension Program (ADAP-OEP) was developed to accompany ADAP but address the needs of criminal defendants who are dependent on opiates.  \n \nIn 2012, the Military and Veteran Service specialized docket (MAVS) was created to better serve criminal defendants who have severe mental illness, chemical dependency, and criminogenic factors, all of which impact their ability to access and navigate services afforded to them because of their military involvement after they are charged with a misdemeanor offense. \n \nThe overall goal of each program is to decrease the number of jail nights and new summons that participants receive by diverting them to clinically appropriate treatment options and helping them to stabilize other basic factors in their lives, such as housing, employment, and education.  The specialized dockets are designed to provide intensive supervision to program participants through a collaborative team process.  \n \nFunds are to be used to assist in the support of the Specialty Docket. The intent of these funds is to provide for personnel costs, and the purchase of materials, supplies, and services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The funds are available in the 2022 general fund budget for transfer.  This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2022 operating budget,\nOrdinance 2741-2021.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $490,000.00 from the general fund to the specialty docket program for the Franklin County Municipal Court.  ($490,000.00) \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the transfer of these funds is necessary in order to continue the enhancement of specialty docket and the payment thereof; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Franklin County Municipal Court to transfer funds in order for the Municipal Court to commence expending these funds, all for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare; now therefore;\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer $490,000 FROM Division 2501, OC 10, General Fund 1000, Subfund 100010 TO Division 2501, OC 80, Specialty Docket Fund 2226, Subfund 222604.\n \nSee attachment for transfer funds.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these transactions are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the city's financial records.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
