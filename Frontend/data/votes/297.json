    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   Since 1974, Columbus Public Health has provided primary health care services to the underserved through contracts with community-based health centers. Since 1998, Columbus Public Health has contracted with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (CNHC), a not-for-profit corporation, to provide primary health care services to medically indigent patients at various neighborhood health centers. This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a contract with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (dba PrimaryOne Health) to provide primary health care and dental services at community-based health centers for a total amount of $4,299,110.00 for the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. This ordinance waives competitive bidding provisions of the City Code. CNHC's Contract Compliance No. is 311533908.\n \nCommunity Health Centers (CHC) are successful, low-cost options for primary care access in a nation that spends $2 trillion a year on health care. Medical costs for CHC patients are 41% lower compared to patients seen elsewhere such as a hospital emergency room. As a result CHC’s save the health care system between $9.9 billion and $17.6 billion a year.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to ensure timely payments to the contractor.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This Ordinance is contingent on the passage of the annual appropriation ordinance for the Health Special Revenue Fund, Ordinance No. 2502-2020, which will provide funding for this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to enter into a contract with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc.

($4,299,110.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus seeks to ensure primary health care and dental services through various neighborhood health centers; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to contract with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (dba PrimaryOne Health) for the management and operations of the neighborhood health centers; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code in order to contract with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (dba PrimaryOne Health) ; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Health Department in that it is immediately necessary to enter into a contract with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (dba PrimaryOne Health) to avoid delays in client services, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc.

That this Council finds it in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
