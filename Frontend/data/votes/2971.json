    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Historic Resources Commission (HRC) (CC 3117) is charged, in part, with identifying districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects that are of significance to the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation; maintaining a list of these districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects; and providing regulation of these properties through design review.  With these goals in mind, the Commission provides recommendations to City Council for the potential listing of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties.  \n \nAn application has been made by Wendy Hoge Naylor and Diana Wellman/Naylor Wellman, LLC. (Applicant), in cooperation with Anne Little, VP & Associate General Counsel, Woda Group (Owner), to list the property located at 120 South Central Avenue, West High School, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties.  The subject building is locally significant “as an excellent example of Neoclassical style public-school architecture representing the work of David Riebel, the first architect for Columbus City School District Board of Education from 1893 to 1922” (Naylor & Wellman p. 11). The period of significance for the building is from 1908, the year of construction, to 1929, when the building was converted for use as Starling Junior High School when a new West High School was constructed. The Columbus Register boundary for the property consists of the northern portion of one parcel (Franklin County Parcel #010-066699-00), and includes the property historically associated with the 1908/1926 West High School. The entirety is bounded by South Central Avenue to the west, W. State Street to the north, Brehl Avenue to the east, and the north side of the unnamed 15’ vacated alley to the south. \n \nProper notice was given to the property owner, per CC 3117.061, and a signed and notarized owner consent form has been received. A public hearing was held January 20, 2022, per CC 3117.063. The public hearing was attended by the Applicant and the Owner, who provided comments in support of the listing of the property. \n \nThe Commission voted unanimously to recommend listing of the property located at 120 South Central Avenue, West High School, on the Columbus Register based on the following criteria outlined in CC 3117.05:\n \nCriterion C: “The property is identified as a significant work of an architect, artisan, engineer, landscape architect or builder whose individual work has influenced the historical, architectural or cultural development of the city, state or nation.” \n \nThis legislation is submitted as an emergency to facilitate eligibility for historic tax credits, in conjunction with the planned rehabilitation and adaptive use of the building, without delay. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None\n \nTitle\nTo list the property at 120 South Central Avenue, West High School, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties as CR #81; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Historic Resources Commission is charged, in part, with identifying districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects of significance to the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation; and\n \nWHEREAS, as part of this responsibility, the commission provides recommendations to City Council for the potential listing of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties; and\n \nWHEREAS, an application has been made by Wendy Hoge Naylor and Diana Wellman/Naylor Wellman, LLC.
