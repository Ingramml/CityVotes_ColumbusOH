    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community of Caring Development Foundation in support of the 2022 Linden Bike Giveaway.\n \nThe mission of the Community of Caring Foundation is \"creating a connected community.\" One of the most important things a community can give a child is the feeling that they matter; are connected and cared for. Over the past three years, New Salem Church, in partnership with its non-profit arm the Community of Caring Development Foundation, have raised over $25,000 dollars and given away over 200 bicycles to 5th graders in the Linden community. While the organization has been able to share these bikes, the real gift comes from the stories of the students, who, witnessing the community’s generosity, have sought to pay it forward to a younger sibling, friend or neighbor, offering their old bike as a gift. The goal through this initiative is to build stronger neighborhoods by increasing mobility and support for families.\n \nTarget constituencies include Linden area 5th grade students and their families at Huy Elementary School, Oakland Park Elementary School, Linden STEM Elementary School, East Linden Elementary School, and Hamilton Elementary School. The organization plans to distribute 500 bikes, with follow-up coordination for bike safety training in collaboration with the Department of Neighborhoods and Nationwide Children’s Hospital’s Bike Rodeo initiative.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the organization to immediately acquire the bikes necessary for the giveaway event.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Community of Caring Development Foundation in support of the 2022 Linden Bike Giveaway; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
