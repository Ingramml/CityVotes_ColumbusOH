    "description": "Explanation\nIn January 2020, the Columbus Community Safety Advisory Commission presented final recommendations for police reform focused on areas such as de-escalation, crisis intervention, and implicit bias training; use of force policies; diversity recruitment and retention; and early intervention and officer wellness programs. Their recommendations were informed by and consistent with an independent operational review of the Columbus Division of Police conducted by Matrix Consulting. \n \nAmong their recommendations, the Commission recommended the City implement a process for independent investigation of:  1) officer use of force, including but not limited to, officer use of force resulting in death, officer involved shootings, and in-custody injuries and deaths; and 2) complaints about serious Columbus Division of Police officer misconduct. \n \nIn July 2020, consistent with the recommendations of the Columbus Community Safety Advisory Commission, Mayor Ginther and City Council announced their intent to place an issue on the November ballot to amend the City Charter to establish a civilian police review board and a Department of the Inspector General for the Columbus Division of Police. On November 3, 2020, Columbus voters overwhelmingly approved the amendment by nearly 75 percent.\n \nIn April 2021, Mayor Ginther appointed, with Columbus City Council’s concurrence, the inaugural members of the Columbus Civilian Police Review Board and on February 1, 2022, the Board appointed an Inspector General who was confirmed by the Mayor on February 2, 2022.  The Inspector General is scheduled to take office on March 8, 2022.  This ordinance amends the effective date of Columbus City Codes Section 235.05 by amending its enacting ordinance, 1169-2021, to allow for sufficient time to establish the Department of the Inspector General and to provide for a date certain when the Department will assume its statutory duties.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in that it is necessary to pass this ordinance in order to allow for the timely establishment of the Department of the Inspector General and to provide for a date certain for it to commence its duties, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety. \n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance 1169-2021 to establish a July 11, 2022 effective date for Section 235.05 of the Columbus City Codes to allow for establishment of the Department of the Inspector General and the assumption of its duties; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in January 2020, the Columbus Community Safety Advisory Commission presented final recommendations for police reform focused on areas such as de-escalation, crisis intervention, and implicit bias training; use of force policies; diversity recruitment and retention; and early intervention and officer wellness programs; and\n \nWHEREAS, among their recommendations, the Commission called for the establishment of an independent civilian review board, and an amendment to the City Charter to create a city-funded, operationally independent, professionally-staffed, public-facing entity empowered to participate fully in administrative investigations involving Division of Police personnel; and\n \nWHEREAS in July 2020, consistent with the recommendation of the Columbus Community Safety Advisory Commission, Mayor Ginther and City Council announced their intent to place an issue on the November ballot to amend the City Charter to establish a civilian police review board and a Department of the Inspector General for the Columbus Division of Police. On November 3, 2020, Columbus voters overwhelmingly approved the amendment by nearly 75 percent; and \n \nWHEREAS, In April 2021, Mayor Ginther appointed, with Columbus City Council’s concurrence, the inaugural members of the Columbus Civilian Police Review Board; and \n \nWHEREAS, on July 15, 2021, City Council enacted Ordinance No. 1169-2021 establishing the duties of the Department of the Inspector General; and\n \nWHEREAS, on February 1, 2022, the Civilian Police Review Board appointed an Inspector General who was confirmed by the Mayor on February 2, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of the Inspector General for the Division of Police in that sufficient time is needed to establish the Department of the Inspector General and to provide for a date certain when the Department will assume its statutory duties so as to provide oversight of the Columbus Division of Police as soon as possible; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Section 2 of Ordinance 1169-2021 be amended to read as follows:\n \nSECTION 2. That section 235.05 enacted by Sections 1 this ordinance, shall take effect ninety (90) days from the Mayor’s confirmation of the Inspector General’s appointment by the Civilian Police Review Board as provided for in Sec. 217 of the City Charter on July 11, 2022. The remaining sections enacted by Section 1 shall take effect on the effective date of this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2. That the existing Section 2 of Ordinance No. 1169-2021 is hereby repealed.\nSECTION 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor does not approve the same.",
