    "description": "Title\n \nTo express opposition to State legislation which removes the requirements for training and a permit to legally carry a concealed firearm. \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the enactment of Senate Bill 215 would eliminate the current training and background checks required to carry a concealed firearm; and \n \nWHEREAS, there is a serious concern that those previously rejected for a conceal carry permit would now be able to avoid background checks; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Mayors Alliance recently provided opposition testimony, citing a surge of gun violence in Ohio and how this legislation would exacerbate violent crime; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ohio's Fraternal Order of Police oppose the bill, testifying that the burden on police officers to ask if someone has a loaded gun in their vehicle will create more dangerous situations for officers and residents; and \n \nWHEREAS, studies have shown that states that have looser carry concealed criteria have a higher rate of gun deaths than states with common sense concealed carry rules; and\n \nWHEREAS, death from firearms have significantly increased in Ohio in 2021, with more Ohioans death due to gun violence than almost any year on record; and\n \nWHEREAS, gun violence has a disproportionate impact on communities of color, with Black Americans experiencing more than ten times the gun violence compared to white Americans; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby express its opposition Senate Bill 215 and associated legislative efforts to unravel common sense gun safety protections.",
