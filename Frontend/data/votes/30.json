    "description": "Explanation1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and to accept Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant funds from Clean Fuels Ohio.\n \nThe United States Department of Energy (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Office recently selected Clean Fuels Ohio to receive a $670,000.00 grant award as part of the 2020 Advanced Vehicle Technologies Research Funding Opportunity.  Clean Fuels Ohio sought funding to support its Zero Emission Freight Future Project, which is designed to prove viability and operational and financial effectiveness of med-heavy duty Electric Vehicles (EVs) in new fleets and communities.\n \nClean Fuels Ohio, in turn, has named the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection as a sub-recipient for the Zero Emission Freight Future Project and will provide to the City a reimbursement grant, whereby the City must provide funding to cover expenses as they are incurred and subsequently will be reimbursed for up to 50% of eligible expenses. Pursuant to the proposed Sub-Recipient Agreement, the City will be reimbursed a maximum of $500,000 over the three year grant period. The Department of Public Service will provide documentation for these expenses to Clean Fuels Ohio, who will then reimburse the City for eligible expenses. \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to accept a Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant from Clean Fuels Ohio, to execute those documents necessary to accept the grant, to administer the grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of that award, and to refund any unused funds to Clean Fuels Ohio after the grant period ends if final accounting determines a refund is owed.  Separate legislation will be submitted to Council to expend awarded grant funds and to encumber and expend necessary matching City funds.  \n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTGrant funding will be allocated to support the purchase of one (1) electric, automated refuse truck for the Division of Refuse Collection. The City will be responsible for all reporting required for the project, as outlined in the grant’s Statement of Project Objectives and the terms and conditions.\n3.  FISCAL IMPACTPursuant to the terms and conditions of the Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant, the Department of Public Service will be responsible for covering the initial purchase of the vehicle and will be reimbursed up to 50% of eligible costs, not to exceed $500,000.00. Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of City funds for that purpose will be put forth at a later time.   \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATIONEmergency action is requested to allow for the execution of necessary grant documents and the acceptance and receipt of Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant funding in accordance with the conditions of that award as soon as possible.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with, and to accept a Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant in the amount of up to $500,000.00 from, Clean Fuels Ohio; to authorize the repayment of any unused grant funds at the end of the grant period, as may be necessary; and to declare an emergency.   \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Energy has awarded Clean Fuels Ohio a grant to study zero emissions; and\n \nWHEREAS, Clean Fuels Ohio intends to award the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection up to $500,000.00 as a sub-recipient of the Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant; and\n \nWHEREAS, that grant award will be used by the Department of Public Service to support the purchase of an electric, automated refuse truck for the Division of Refuse Collection, in accordance with the Statement of Project Objectives and the terms and conditions; and \n \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute a Sub-Recipient Agreement, and any amendments and modifications thereto as may be necessary, with and to accept awarded grant funding from Clean Fuels Ohio for the stated purpose; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists within the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to execute the necessary grant documents and the acceptance and receipt of Zero Emission Freight Future Project grant funding from Clean Fuels Ohio in accordance with the conditions of that award as soon as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to execute agreements necessary to effectuate the acceptance of a Zero Emission Freight Future Project Grant, as sub-recipient, from Clean Fuels Ohio and to administer the awarded grant and to seek reimbursement from Clean Fuels Ohio for eligible grant expenses.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
