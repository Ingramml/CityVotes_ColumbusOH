    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the contract with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. for one 37-foot Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) splicing utility truck.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, advertised and solicited bids for one 37-foot Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) splicing utility truck in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding (Solicitation RFQ019383) through Vendor Services.  The City received one bid that did not fully meet the specifications for the truck on August 19, 2021.  Previous legislation 2456-2021 authorized the Director of Finance and Management to accept the ITS splicing utility vehicle as bid, enter into a contract, and authorized the expenditure on behalf of the Department of Public Service. \n \nAfter the award was complete, Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to supply chain and labor issues beyond their control the delivery of the truck would be delayed beyond the previously anticipated delivery date. In addition to a later anticipated delivery date, the manufacturer is also no longer able to provide the truck as previously defined. Changes to the truck include manual door locks and windows rather than power door locks and windows, which reduces the cost by $273.00. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify the existing contract to extend the delivery date and accept the changes to the door locks and windows features. The Department feels these changes are de minimis and the vehicle offered by Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. will meet the needs of the Department.   \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance authorizes ACPR002056 from ordinance 2456-2021 to be associated with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe department requests emergency designation so this equipment can be put into service as quickly as possible to prevent interruption to, or disruption of, the Division of Traffic Management operations. \n \nTitle \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to modify a contract with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. for acquisition of one 37-foot Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) splicing utility truck; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, has a need for an 37-foot Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) splicing utility truck; and\n \nWHEREAS, proposals were solicited for the truck; and \n \nWHEREAS, the only bid received was from Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. and it was accepted as bid by the Department of Finance on behalf of the Department of Public Service; and\n \nWHEREAS, after the award was complete, Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to supply chain and labor issues beyond their control, the delivery of the truck would be delayed beyond the previously anticipated delivery date; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department feels the changes to the door locks and windows features are de minimis and the vehicle offered by Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. will meet the needs of the Department; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the contract with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. to accept a later delivery date and de minimis specifications changes to the type of door locks and windows, thereby reducing the cost by $273.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to associate ACPR002056 with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the contract for the 37-foot Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) splicing utility truck so this equipment can be put into service as quickly as possible to prevent interruption to, or disruption of, the Division of Traffic Management operations, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify the contract with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc. for one 37-foot Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) splicing utility truck.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to associate ACPR002056 with Utility Truck Equipment, Inc.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project. \n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
