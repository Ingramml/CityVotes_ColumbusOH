As part of that effort, the Department of Public Service has agreed to install ADA curb ramps and pavement markings at four intersections adjacent to Easton Town Center: \n•                     Easton Loop and Charter Oak Way\n•                     Easton Loop and Easton Station\n•                     Easton Loop and Townsfair Way\n•                     Easton Loop and Worth Avenue\n \nEaston Town Center will contribute funding to defray construction and inspection costs incurred during the completion of improvements for these intersections. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nBased on preliminary cost estimates, Easton Town Center has agreed to deposit $30,682.00 with the City to support its share of anticipated construction and inspection costs incurred during the completion of Resurfacing - 2022 Project 1, with the understanding that the actual amount owed for that work may vary based on final quantities and costs.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget and the appropriation of $30,682.00 within the Street & Highway Improvement Non-Bond Fund are necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient budget authority, cash, and appropriation for this expenditure and any related future expenditures.  If the funds deposited by Easton Town Center exceed the amount needed for its proportionate share construction and inspection costs, the remaining funds will be refunded.  \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute any and all necessary agreements with Easton Town Center as soon as reasonably practicable to prevent delays in the completion of Resurfacing - 2022 Project 1.\nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget;
