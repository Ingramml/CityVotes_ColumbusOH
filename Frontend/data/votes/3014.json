    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects to add additional funding for the design of the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project.\nOrdinance No. 1934-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $500,000.00 professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects for the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project.  The initial Phase 1 of the project is to extend Westbourne Avenue from Taylor Station Road to Granite Pointe Drive, including modifications at the intersection of Taylor Station Road and the existing Westbourne Avenue to add a dedicated southbound right-turn lane from Westbourne Avenue to Taylor Station Road. McNaughten Road will also be extended south from the proposed roundabout on the extension of Westbourne Avenue to the southern property line of the former Lucent site on Franklin County Tax ID Parcel 520-269045 to allow for a future connection to McNaughten Road at E. Broad Street if/when Mount Carmel ever redevelops their corporate office site on Franklin County Tax ID Parcel 520-274542. Design includes modifications to the existing signal at Taylor Station Road to bring it up to compliance, as well as full roadway design including shared use paths (SUP), sidewalk, stormwater controls, water main design, and lighting design.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $675,000.00.\n \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to cover Phase 1 of the design.  Modifications are also planned for Phases 2 and 3.
