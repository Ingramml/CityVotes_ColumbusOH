    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) annually accepts applications to fund projects using Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program funds.  SRTS funds are available to communities as grants to be used to improve the ability of elementary and middle school students to walk and bicycle to school safely.  A community may be awarded up to $400,000 for an infrastructure project.  March 4, 2022 is the deadline for the current Safe Routes to School application cycle.\n \nThe Department of Public Service is preparing a Safe Routes to School application, with a current focus on completing pedestrian connections serving Mifflin Middle School and Cassady Alternative Elementary School. This project is on priority corridors for Mifflin Middle School and Cassady Alternative School, and it would provide improved facilities for students walking and biking to these schools.  ODOT requires the submission of an ordinance if the application is successful and selected to receive grant funding.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECT\nThe Department of Public Service plans to submit an application for the following project:\n \nPedestrian Safety Improvements - SRTS Mifflin Middle and Cassady Alternative Elementary Schools Pedestrian Connections: This project will fill multiple sidewalk and shared-use path gaps.  The project will fill a gap in sidewalk on the east side of Sunbury Road, from the intersection of Sunbury Road at Agler Road to the existing facilities north of Mifflin Middle School.  It will extend a shared-use path on the south side of Agler Road from its current terminus to the intersection of Sunbury Road at Agler Road.  The project will also add sidewalks on both sides of Cassady Avenue, from the intersection of Cassady Avenue at Agler Road to the existing facilities on either side.  The current project cost estimate is approximately $1,120,000.00.\n \n(This listing is meant to be illustrative and is believed to be accurate and complete; however, last minute project additions and substitutions are at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.)\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts, right of way acquisition, and/or construction contracts that will be submitted for Council's approval.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide Council's approval to apply for the grant prior to the March 4, 2022 deadline for applications\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to prepare and submit a Safe Routes to School Application to the Ohio Department of Transportation;
