    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with 2K General Company to provide construction services for the Gymnasium Dividers Improvements 2020-2021 Project. The contract amount is $367,600.00, with a contingency of $35,000.00, for a total of $402,600.00 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance. This ordinance will also authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with XYZ Professional Services, LTD for the design phase of this same project. The modification amount being authorized is $20,000.00, making a new aggregate total of $153,032.00 for the design contract. An additional $10,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $432,600.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department has a total of sixteen locations that need room divider systems to accommodate the ability to safely host multiple activities at the same time in their gymnasiums and/or multipurpose rooms. As a result of this project, the Community Centers and Athletic Complexes involved will be improved to allow them to host several different activities at once in these spaces. This construction contract with 2K General Company will complete the installation of the divider systems in each of the 16 facilities. XYZ Professional Services, who is needed for support during construction, is the firm that put the contract documents together for the installation of these curtains in our facilities. The intent is to provide vertical dividers and associated electric motorized devices to lower and raise the room dividers to separate large areas and allow for multiple users to safely use the space, especially during this time of social distancing due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. \n \nA significant portion of the funding for this project, in the amount of $378,000.00 has been provided by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG-CV) in accordance with the 2020 Amended Annual Action Plan. The remainder of the funding for this project is being provided by the Voted Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.\n \nThe following locations are part of this project:\n \nIn-Kind Replacement - Gym Dividers:\nBerliner Athletic Complex - 1300 Deckenbach Rd, Columbus, OH 43223\nBig Run Athletic Complex - 4205 Clime Rd, Columbus, OH 43228\nBill McDonald Athletic Complex - 4990 Olentangy River Rd, Columbus, OH 43214\nCleo Dumaree Athletic Complex - 276 S.
