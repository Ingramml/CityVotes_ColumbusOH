    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Michael Baker International, Inc. to provide engineering services associated with the parkland design for the Alum Creek Trail Connections - Mock Road and Sunbury Drive Project. The contract amount is $529,821.00, with a contingency of $32,660.00, for a total of $562,481.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector will become a direct 1.2 mile connection for the near Northeast Community to the City’s regional trail system. The connector will be a 10 foot wide paved path from the Alum Creek Trail at Sunbury Drive and Mock Road, heading west and connecting directly to the city’s new Hudson Street Greenway. This connection will open a seamless 3.5 mile east-west trail from I-71, near the proposed Community Sports Park, to the Alum Creek Trail. By linking these two east-west projects, over 6,000 residents of the Arlington Park, Woodland Holt, Brittany Hills, Argyle Park, and East Linden neighborhoods will be within 10 minutes of walking and biking connectivity to parks, churches, schools, retail, and jobs. \n \nThe Alum Creek Trail - Sunbury Drive Connector will link trail users from the Alum Creek Trail to Sunbury Drive and Sunbury Road, ultimately connecting to a private development proposed shared use path off of Agler Road. This connection will further extend the reaches of the greenway network to the Northeast Area neighborhoods. This contract covers the environmental assessment and preliminary engineering portions of the Sunbury Drive Connector portion of work.\n \nIn February of 2020, the Department applied for Clean Ohio Trail Funds to build a trail connection to the Alum Creek Trail from Mock Road for the near Northeast area of Columbus, as authorized by Ordinance 0426-2020. In March of 2021, the Department received notice that the grant was approved. The Clean Ohio Trails Fund will be providing $485,000 of the construction costs for the Mock Road Connector. The Department of Development’s UIRF (Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund) program will be providing $400,000.00 in funds towards the Sunbury Drive connection.  \nThis design contract is anticipated to proceed in February 2022 and have construction plans ready for bidding by June of 2023. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on October 21, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 10, 2021.  Proposals were received from the following firms:\n \nMichael Baker International, Inc. (MAJ)\nMoody Engineering (MBE)                                          \n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price.

Designing a greenway trail along Mock Road to the City’s new Hudson Street Greenway and designing a greenway trail connecting the Alum Creek Trail to Sunbury Drive ties directly to the City’s goal of providing a lift to inner city neighborhoods cut off from safe and easy access to greenways and outdoor experiences. Additionally, four schools, seven churches, three markets, a 100 acre park, an athletic complex, a senior living facility, and a child care facility are located along the Mock Road Corridor’s 1.2 miles.  The Sunbury Drive to Agler Road connection has been noted as a key access for the near Northeast Community to the regional trail, Howard Community Center, and the Mifflin Junior High School.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Letters of Support were received from non-profit organizations, residents, a school principal, and the Central Ohio Greenways board. The project team will further public engagement, during the winter of 2022, through open houses, an online survey, social media, and key stakeholder meetings.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Northeast (41)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Department’s Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides equitable and safe access to the trail system for underserved communities. \n \nFiscal Impact: $562,481.00 is budgeted and available from within the Special Purpose Fund 2223, Subfund 222332 and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Michael Baker International, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the Alum Creek Trail Connections - Mock Road and Sunbury Drive Project; to authorize the appropriation of $79,000.00 within the Special Purpose Fund; to authorize the transfer of $483,481.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $562,481.00 from the Special Purpose Fund and Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
