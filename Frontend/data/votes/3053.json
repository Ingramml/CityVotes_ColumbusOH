    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into contract with Alvis, Inc. for emergency temporary housing for Unleashing Potential (UP) participants.  The program will have five beds available everyday all year.\n \nThe UP program will provide transformative justice for emerging adults who have come into contact with our justice system and are at risk for continued criminal behavior due to lack of resources and a support system.\n \nEmerging adults, defined as individuals transitioning from childhood to adulthood between the ages of 18 and 25, are in an age category where cognitive skills and emotional intelligence continues to  develop. While emerging adults make up ten percent of the U.S. population, in Ohio, emerging adults represented 18% of total arrests in 2016. Nationwide, emerging adults represent 29% of arrests.\nIndividuals in this age bracket can naturally age out of criminal activities as their cognitive skills develop when they are provided the support and opportunities necessary to become independent,  productive members of their communities.\n \nUP is intended for justice-involved individuals age 18-25 years, with a moderate-high risk of recidivism and high level of criminogenic needs.  Eligibility will be based on the nature and type of charges filed, as well as that defendant’s prior criminal history.  Charges generally must be non-violent in nature, but cases will be considered on a case by case basis. The program would provide health and behavioral health services/trauma informed care, parenting services/support, successful  navigation of public assistance programs, drivers licensing and transportation assistance, education and workforce  development utilizing AMP (Achieve More & Prosper), safe stable, affordable housing, and family/community support.\n \nParticipation in the program is usually one year or longer, depending on the individual’s needs and progress. To successfully graduate, the participants must demonstrate adherence to their action plans. Upon graduation, the case will be resolved pursuant to the negotiated agreement (either reduction of the charge or dismissal of the charge) between the prosecuting attorney, defense attorney and the court.\n \nThe goals of the UP court program are to ensure public safety and reduce recidivism, increase the assets of young adults to help them transform their lives, provide justice involved young adults with a meaningful path to reducing/eliminating their criminal record, and to increase collaboration  \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is requested to allow for emergency placement of UP participants.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The funds are available in the 2022 IDAT funds.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into contract with Alvis, Inc. for emergency temporary housing for Unleashing Potential (UP) participants; to authorize the expenditure of up to $69,350 for housing services from the IDAT funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($69,350.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $69,350.00 is needed to provide for drug testing services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Franklin County Municipal Court is in need of emergency temporary housing from Alvis; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Franklin County Municipal Court Judges in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into contract with Alvis, Inc. to allow emergency placement of participants, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  \n \nSECTION 1.
