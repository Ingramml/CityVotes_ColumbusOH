    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND   \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to renew a professional services contract with Epro Services, LLC for the fire safety and security service contract for year three of a possible four-year contract term.  It also authorizes a contract modification for this contract so funds can be added to pay for the third year of services.  \n \nIn 2020, the Department of Public Service solicited Requests for Proposals (Solicitation RFQ015135) for the fire safety and security service contract for the Department of Public Service, Divisions of Refuse Collection, Infrastructure Management, Design and Construction, and Traffic Management.  The contract was to be used for repairing and/or replacing, inspecting, and monitoring all aspects of building fire safety systems and specialty equipment needs of the divisions.  The 2020 service contract and PO222867 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Epro Services, LLC, which was the bidder that submitted the proposal that scored the highest by the evaluation committee.  The initial term of this contract was for one year with the option of three one-year renewals. Public Service would like to renew the contract to continue this service for year three of the contract and to add funds in the amount of up to $25,500.00 to pay for these additional services.  \n \nThe original contract amount:                                                 $17,500.00                   (PO222867-1)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                              $17,700.00                   (PO270504-1)\nThe total of Modification No. 2                                                                                            $25,500.00                                                (This ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                     $60,700.00\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Epro Services, LLC.                                          \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Epro Services, LLC is CC002338 and expires 9/3/2022.                      \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT \nThis planned contract renewal and expenditure was budgeted in the General Fund, Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, Private Construction Inspection Fund, and Public Construction Inspection Fund.  Funding is appropriated for this expenditure in these funds.  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe department requests emergency designation for this ordinance to prevent interruption of services.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to renew the fire safety and security service contract with Epro Services, LLC and to modify the contract to add funds to pay for the renewal;
