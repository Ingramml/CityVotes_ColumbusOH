    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  Professional Construction Management services are needed to ensure construction of the Lower Olentangy Tunnel follows the requirements and specifications of the project design and that the City receives an end product capable of providing the intended function.  Existing City staff is not adequate to devote multiple qualified personnel full time to management of the project construction activities.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $1,000,000.00\nOriginal Contract                                                                                                                              $4,174,157.47 PO221727\nRenewal # 1 (Current)                                                                                                                              $4,707,574.39\nRenewal # 2 (2023)                                                                                                                              $5,000,000.00\nRenewal # 3 (2024)                                                                                                                              $4,500,000.00\nRenewal # 4 (2025)                                                                                                                              $3,500,000.00\nRenewal # 5 (2026)                                                                                                                              $1,500,000.00\nCURRENT PROPOSED TOTAL                                                                                    $23,381,731.86\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThis is a planned contract renewal and the additional services were identified in the original contract ordinance (0247-2021).\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nSubstantial information and knowledge has been developed by the consultant through work performed during the first year of work.  If the work to be performed under this Renewal was to be bid out separately, tasks already completed would be performed repetitively causing significant delays and incurring additional cost.  Also delays would put the City at risk of missing consent order deadlines.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost was negotiated between the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and the vendor, Black & Veatch Corporation. \n \n2. PROJECT TIMELINE: The original agreement allowed for a total term of approximately 7 years. This renewal is to cover portions of year 2 and 3. Originally there were 4 planned renewals but after the initial contract was awarded, additional construction work was added to the contract that will require a 5th renewal for the final year.\n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n    \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  43-1833073 | MAJ | Exp. 09/2/2023| Vendor # 008038\n5. ECONOMIC IMPACT: The project is part of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage’s 2015 Blueprint program which included significant outreach for the program.  The project will improve water quality in the Olentangy River by substantially reducing wet weather overflows from seven CSO structures as well as three other sewer relief structures.\n \n6. FISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes the transfer within and expenditure of up to $4,707,574.39 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget is also needed to align the authority with the expenditure.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew (renewal #1) an existing engineering agreement with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel Professional Construction Management; to transfer within and expend up to $4,707,574.39 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget. ($4,707,574.39)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the original agreement, Contract No. PO221727 was authorized by Ordinance 0247-2020, passed March 2, 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Lower Olentangy Tunnel Professional Construction Management Renewal #1 is necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the City and its design professionals in planning and coordination of the work; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the existing engineering agreement for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate, transfer within and expend up to $4,707,574.39 in funds from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116 for said renewal; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director to renew an existing professional engineering service agreement with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel Professional Construction Management for the preservation of the public health and safety; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
