    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Elford, Inc. for the Water Quality Assurance Lab (WQAL) Renovations Project in an amount up to $21,545,250.00; to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00; for Capital Improvements Project No. 690515-100000, Division of Water Contract Number 2179.\n \nWork consists of renovations and commissioning of the Water Quality Assurance Laboratory including, but not limited to, demolition of the existing laboratory interior walls, floors, drop ceilings, casework, miscellaneous architectural, mechanical, plumbing, fire protection, miscellaneous structural, electrical, and information technology to provide all construction and commissioning for new of the aforementioned items, renovations to areas outside of the Water Quality Assurance Laboratory footprint, construction and commissioning of a temporary laboratory facility, including laboratory operations sequencing, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract, in accordance with the plans and specifications set forth in the Invitation For Bid.\n \nThe Community Planning Area for this project is “99 - N/A” since the lab serves multiple community planning areas.\n \n2.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  The lab was originally constructed in 1984 and has not had any major renovations in over 25 years. Equipment is aging and replacement parts are difficult to produce.  When the lab was originally designed computer workstations were not in use and subsequent installations have not been ergonomically designed.  The Water Quality Assurance Lab is an integral part of the water treatment process ensuring regulatory requirements and reporting are met.  Safe, compliant water quality and quantity are necessary for community economic growth.  The majority of the work will occur within areas that are not accessible to the public, so no community outreach is anticipated.\n \n3.0 CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The Director of Public Utilities publicly opened three (3) bids on December 1, 2021:\n \n1.                     Elford, Inc.                     $21,545,250.00                     *after bid tab correction\n2.                     2K General Company                     $16,974,000.00                     \n3.                     R.W. Setterlin Building Co.                     $19,252,964.20                     *after bid tab correction\n \nThe bid from 2K General Company was deemed Non-Responsive for failing to name a subcontractor for the lab move as required by Spec 11 53 01.\n \nThe bid from R.W. Setterlin Building Co. was deemed Non-Responsive for failing to provide an employee or subcontractor with an active water/sewer contractor's tappers license.                      \n \nElford’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $21,545,250.00.  Their Contract Compliance Number is 31-4371060 (expires 5/27/22, Majority) and their DAX Vendor No. is 6059.  Additional information regarding all bidders, description of work, contract time frame and detailed amounts can be found on the attached Information form.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Elford, Inc. \n \n3.1 PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS: Elford, Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \n4.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  This Ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Water System Reserve Fund - Fund No. 6003 to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund - Fund No. 6011, in order to fund this proposed expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the Division is able to execute a loan with the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund and reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in March 2022.  \n \nA transfer within the Water G.O.
