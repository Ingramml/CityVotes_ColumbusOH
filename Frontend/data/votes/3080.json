CDDC served as the Master Developer for the Columbus Commons project, an award-winning, mixed-use development, and redeveloped the 700,000 square-foot Lazarus Office Building. Currently, CDDC is leading the effort on The Peninsula and has selected development partners to execute the vision for an active, mixed-use, 18-hour district. In addition, CDDC developed key place making spaces such as the Scioto Mile and Dorrian Green, as well as cultural institutions like the first-ever satellite location of the American Museum of National History at COSI and the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.\nEmergency action is requested to allow the project to begin construction as soon as possible.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes a grant agreement up to $7,000,000.00 with Topiary Park Crossing, LTd.
