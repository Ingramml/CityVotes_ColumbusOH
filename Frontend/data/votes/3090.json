    "description": "Title\nTo Celebrate March 17, 2022 as St. Patrick’s Day in the City of Columbus\n \n...Body\n \nWHEREAS, for more than 100 years the Irish of Columbus have promoted and shared their culture and heritage; and\n \nWHEREAS, many of the strong men and women of earlier generations fled The Great Hunger in Ireland to come to a new life in Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, so many of our proud Irish ancestors faced economic, religious and social persecution with heads held high and shoulders squared; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Irish community that faced so much hardship went on to be integral in building the infrastructure of Columbus as well as raising large families that spread from old Irish Broadway out to the North, South, East and West ends of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, we remember the contributions of those who came before us, those who stand with us and thank God for the good fortune to be Irish; and\n \nWHEREAS, the hallmark of Columbus is the strength and integrity of its people, both of which are more than reflected in the 2022 Irish American honorees; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Shamrock Club of Columbus and its President, Andy Shuman ,have led the Club forward in honoring and celebrating our Irish heritage and culture; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Shamrock Club was founded in 1936 and has grown to include more than 2,000 members and offers a wide variety of Irish cultural events and activities every week of the year; and\n \nWHEREAS, together, as Clann na nGael, One Family Irish, we recognize the contributions of the Irish community to the City of Columbus; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this council does hereby celebrate Irish Heritage in the City of Columbus and recognize March 17, 2022 as St. Patrick’s Day.",
