Allen Family Foundation (“Vulcan”). \nThe City, acting through the Department of Public Service, desires to assign ownership of the MMTPA to MORPC because that application aligns with and expands upon the programs and services currently administered by MORPC, including Gohio Commute, a platform providing free commute management software to Central Ohio commuters and businesses. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to the City associated with the execution of the requisite agreements. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (“MORPC”) to effect a change in ownership of the Smart Columbus Multimodal Trip Planning App, also more commonly known as Pivot.  ($0.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (“MORPC”) long have endeavored to create a safe, efficient, and accessible multimodal transportation network capable of supporting current and future population and development in Central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, that objective was central to the projects and initiatives proposed and undertaken by the City of Columbus during the Smart City Challenge, an innovative competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation to “demonstrate how advanced data and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies and applications can be used to reduce congestion, keep travelers safe, protect the environment, respond to climate change, connect underserved communities, and support economic vitality”; and \nWHEREAS, the Smart Columbus Multimodal Trip Planning App (the “MMTPA”), also more commonly known as Pivot, was developed and deployed utilizing Smart City grant funds; and \nWHEREAS, the MMTPA is described as an “intuitive and intelligent trip planning app built to power transit today and inform future advancements in transportation for the benefit of all residents”; and \nWHEREAS, the City, acting through the Department of Public Service, desires to assign ownership of the MMTPA to MORPC, which currently operates the Gohio Commute program, a platform providing free commute management software to Central Ohio commuters and businesses; and \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service to authorize the Director to execute agreements with MORPC for that purpose; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be, and hereby is, authorized to execute agreements with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (“MORPC”) to effect a change in ownership of the Smart Columbus Multimodal Trip Planning App (the “MMTPA”), also more commonly known as Pivot.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
