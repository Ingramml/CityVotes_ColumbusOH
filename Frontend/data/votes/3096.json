    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\nThe Department of Public Service, received a request from E.W. Hubbard High, LLC in 2013 asking that the City allow the installation of a pedestrian bridge over North Pearl Street and to allow a number of other encroachments within the public right-of-way along High Street, Hubbard Avenue and Pearl Street. Ordinance 2473-2013 was passed on November 8, 2013 authorizing these encroachments.  The bridge and encroachments were subsequently constructed but the encroachment easement was never recorded. \n \nNow the owner, E.W. Hubbard High, LLC, has once again sent a request to the Department of Public Service requesting the encroachment easement be granted to formalize the encroachments that have been constructed.  Due to the passage of time since the original ordinance was passed, the Department of Public Service is submitting new legislation seeking authorization for the granting of these easements.  \nThe encroachments are detailed and defined within the attached drawings labeled as right-of-way encroachments and consist of stone bands, canopy, awnings, building mounted lights, brick cornice, steps and the pedestrian bridge that are part of the Hubbard Project comprised of a six-story apartment (72 units) building, 250-space public parking garage and row houses. \n \nThe following legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant the encroachment easements that will legally allow the pedestrian bridge and the proposed building elements listed above to extend into the public rights-of-way. A value of $1,000.00 was established for the encroachment easements.\n \n2.
