($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program. The Clean Ohio Conservation Fund is accepting applications for funding to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors.  If awarded, the funding will be used to acquire properties for preservation of the city’s natural resources. \n \nOPWC administers statewide grant funding to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors and this ordinance authorizes an application for 2022 Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program grant funds only. OPWC requires that a resolution, ordinance, or other written documentation to obligate funds for the project as part of the application. This ordinance is a commitment to provide the necessary match funds at a later date to satisfactorily complete the proposed project and become eligible for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the grant. If the grant funding is awarded, future legislation will follow to authorize acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of City funds from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.\n \nThis grant application is intended to secure funding towards fee simple acquisition of various sites in Columbus, including three sites along West Broad Street in the Franklinton Community and a 64.25 acre site along Big Walnut Creek near Three Creeks Park in the Far South Community. Additional information about these sites is below. \n \n \nFranklinton Greenspace Protection:\n \nStatistics show that the West Franklinton Community has the least amount of public greenspace in Columbus with only 10.8 acres of parkland in a community of over 9,000 residents. The purpose of the project is to acquire five acres of greenspace in the West Franklinton Community on West Broad Street. The properties are within three blocks of each other. Included are four lots at West Broad Street and West Park Avenue as well as one parcel at West Broad and Glenwood Avenue. These sites will become protected passive greenspace in the City’s most underserved community for parks and open space.  They will add additional public greenspace adjacent to existing parkland, providing open space for passive recreation, space for planting trees, and increased opportunities are walking and biking. \nBig Walnut Creek South Preservation:\n \nBig Walnut Creek is known to be one of the highest quality major waterways in Central Ohio.  For several years, the south segment of the river has been a focus of Recreation and Parks to acquire and preserve endangered riparian corridor. The purpose of the project is to acquire 64.25 acres of riparian property on Big Walnut Creek on the southeast side of Columbus, near Winchester Pike and I-270.  Over 0.75 mile, or approx. 3,700 linear feet, of Big Walnut Creek flows through the site. Acquiring this property along the west bank of Big Walnut Creek will complete the protection of 1.5 miles of the river corridor on both banks.\nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\nClean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program, Clean Ohio Conservation Fun - District 3\n65 East State Street, Suite 312\nColumbus, OH  43215\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to obtain approval to apply for this grant as it is required to be submitted by March 11, 2022.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Protection of the city’s high quality waterways, greenway corridors, ravines, and urban forests is of great benefit to current and future generations. These sites are within rapidly urbanizing areas of the city and preservation of key natural sites is one of the main missions of Recreation and Parks. Conservation of the sites proposed relies heavily upon outside funding assistance to achieve these benefits.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During the past decade, residents in these communities, and the city at large, have expressed strong priority for more protected stream corridors, headwater tributaries, access to nature, walking paths, and urban forest conservation.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54), Far South (64)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by protecting the environmental health and resilience of the city’s waterways. It will provide long term protected corridors for walking, biking, and outdoor experiences while improving the equitable access to trails and greenways.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. Future legislation will accept, appropriate, and encumber funding for this project as needed if the grant is awarded. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program which will be used to acquire various properties for preservation of the city’s natural resources; and to declare an emergency.
