    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND:  The Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section and the Department of Public Service (DPS) have a need to enter into a Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement Agreement with Delaware County Ohio, for the Lazelle Road Culvert and Storm Sewer Replacement Project, DPU CIP 610855-100005 and DPS CIP 530282-100000. \nOn behalf of the Lazelle Road Culvert and Storm Sewer Replacement Project, Delaware County Ohio will seek to replace a culvert and storm sewer crossing Lazelle Road East of U.S. Route 23 and resurface Lazelle Road between U.S. Route 23 and Lazelle Road East.  Delaware County has designed and obtained easements for the project.  These improvements straddle the City of Columbus corporation limits and unincorporated Delaware County.  The Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section and the Department of Public Service have agreed to reimburse the developer for a portion of the cost, up to $121,000. \nPlanning Area is 32 (Far North).\n2. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency designation is not requested at this time. \n3. ECONOMIC IMPACT:  Lazelle Road is currently closed to traffic since September 2020 at the location of the culvert, due to condition of culvert.  This portion of Lazelle Rd. is half in Columbus and half in Delaware County.  Replacement of culvert and ancillary work will allow the road to reopen, benefitting residents and businesses in the area.  Coordinating the work with Delaware County will allow for efficient and cost-effective completion of the work.\n4. FISCAL IMPACT: The Division of Sewerage & Drainage/Stormwater Section and the Department of Public Service will reimburse the Lazelle Road Culvert and Storm Sewer Replacement Project up to a maximum of $83,000.00 from the DPU Storm Sewer Bond Fund, Fund 6204, and up to a maximum of $38,000 from the DPS Streets and Highways G.O.
