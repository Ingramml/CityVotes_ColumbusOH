    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $3,100,000.00 and the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. in an amount up to $3,100,000.00.\n \nIn 1999 the Capitol South Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation, the Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce and the Columbus Department of Trade and Development initiated an effort to work with downtown property owners to create a Special Improvement District (SID) in the core area of downtown. Property owners were surveyed and overwhelmingly were in support of creating a SID. The SID was created for a five (5) year period and was very successful, and re-authorized for additional 5 year terms in 2006, 2011and 2016.  In 2016 the SID’s petition was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council by Ordinance No. 0610-2016, passed March 14, 2016. \n \nAnother action required by the Ohio Revised Code is the approval of the Plan of Improvements and Services and the inclusion of City owned property in said plan. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0042X-2016, passed March 21, 2016. \n \nThe third piece of legislation was to declare the necessity to implement the Plan of Services adopted by the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and to levy a special assessment for the services. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0097X-2016, passed May 2, 2016. \n \nA final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 1578-2016, passed June 20, 2016. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the District Plan.\n \nThis legislation disburses assessments to be collected in fiscal year 2021 to be returned to the SID. \n \nEmergency action is requested to continue services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from Capital Crossroad SID fund (Fund 3307).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s vendor number is 006946 and is valid from 12/6/19-12/6/21.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $3,100,000.00 from the Short North Capital Crossroads SID fund; authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. in an amount up to $3,100,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
