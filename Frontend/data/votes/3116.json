    "title": "To authorize an appropriation of $75,000.00 to the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging for the continued support of the Housing Assistance Program; and to authorize an appropriation and transfer within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($75,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes an appropriation to the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA) in continued support of the organization’s senior housing stabilization efforts. \n \nIn October 2019, ordinance 2630-2019 was approved by Columbus City Council which provided funding to COAAA to establish the Housing Assistance Program (HAP). In December 2020, ordinance 2875-2020 modified the appropriation by adding an additional $75,000. The program includes preventative efforts to reduce eviction, displacement, and homelessness for Columbus' older adults. The focus is diversion, which is keeping older adults out of the shelter, as well as prevention, to keep from reaching a housing crisis. The funding supports preventive measures for homelessness for Columbus residents 50 and older. The Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA) has staff working daily on supporting older adults through housing crises. With staffing already in place, these funds address needs such as a missed rent or mortgage, rent or utility deposit, housing violation moving expenses, or other hardships related to maintaining safe housing that can lead to displacement.\n \nFiscal Impact: Total appropriation of $75,000 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize an appropriation of $75,000.00 to the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging for the continued support of the Housing Assistance Program; and to authorize an appropriation and transfer within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
