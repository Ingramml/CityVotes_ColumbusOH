However, following passage of the above-mentioned ordinance (and subsequent execution of the contract) it was determined that ten (10) additional licenses were needed to ensure access to the system by the Division of Income Tax. This ordinance authorizes modification of the contract, established by ordinance 1876-2021, to add these licenses at a cost of $37,375.00. The term of this contract modification will be one year from the date of a confirmed purchase order by the City Auditor’s Office.\nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $37,375.00, from Technology’s capital improvement budget, to accommodate the above-described purchase. \nAdditionally, this ordinance authorizes amending the current capital improvement budget with the transfer of cash between projects to accommodate this purchase and the purchase referenced in ordinance 0479-2022.\nFinally, this ordinance authorizes a waiver of the competitive bidding requirements of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes. This is requested to maintain continuity in the on-going project.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe budget authority for this acquisition is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology’s capital improvement budget (fund 5105, project no. 240100-100000).
