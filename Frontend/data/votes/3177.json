    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The Office of CelebrateOne received funding from The Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services to develop a culturally-informed digital media advertising campaign that promotes safe sleep practices and neighborhood initiatives focused on teen health education. To complete the deliverables of this grant, CelebrateOne will contract with The Saunders Company LLC, Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio in the total amount of $647,414.91 for the period of October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.  \n \nThe Saunders Company LLC contract in the amount of $330,000.00 will develop a culturally -informed media advertising campaign that promotes safe sleep practices and to increase enrollment in home visiting services. These services were advertised through Bonfire (RFQ14474) according to bidding requirements of the City Code. \n \nThe Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio sub-award agreement in the amount of $167,414.91 will continue a community based peer to peer education program for teens to develop healthy lifestyles and responsible choices by adolescents. Peer educators will receive training and incentives to increase their knowledge of essential, evidence based sexual health information, establish important leadership skills and gain confidence to engage their peers and larger community in vital conversations. These services were advertised through Bonfire (RFQ015529) according to bidding requirements of the City Code. \n \nThe Nationwide Children’s Hospital sub-award agreement in the amount of $150,000.00 will support the CelebrateOne goal to improve reproductive health planning by implementing evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programming in schools.
