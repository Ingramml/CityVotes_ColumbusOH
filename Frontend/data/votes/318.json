    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with California Skateparks to provide services for the Tuttle Skatepark project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $550,000.00.\n \nColumbus residents have been advocating for additional skateparks within city limits for several years, in addition to the existing skateparks at Dodge and Fairwood Parks. This proposed skatepark at Tuttle Park is an extension of improvements scheduled for Tuttle Park this spring. The Tuttle Park Lower Field Design project, authorized by Ordinance No. 1886-2019, included the necessary public engagement, conceptual design, and construction documentation required for rehabilitation and improvement of the eastern portion of the lower fields of Tuttle Park. These improvements are in response to public requests for park improvements and the addition of a skatepark. In coordination with the Tuttle Community Recreation Commission (CRC), the University Area Commission, and with additional community input, the Department identified programming for the park and skatepark that has been supported by the community.\n \nA skatepark visioning workshop was held on December 3, 2020 to identify specific elements desired for the future skatepark. The workshop defined the skatepark’s basis of design. Due to the highly specialized nature of skatepark improvements, a Request for Qualifications was issued through the City Vendor Services to solicit a qualified skatepark firm to bring the community’s vision of a skatepark into a reality. \n \nThe schedule for the Tuttle Skatepark construction aligns with the anticipated construction schedule for design elements included with the Tuttle Park Lower Field Design project. Design for the skatepark is anticipated to start in March 2021 and construction for the skatepark is anticipated to start in July 2021. All Tuttle Park construction is scheduled to be substantially complete by December 2021. The total project cost for design and construction of the skatepark is $550,000.00. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on October 29, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 30, 2020.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nCalifornia Skateparks - Upland, CA (MAJ)\nEvergreen Skateparks - Portland, OR (MAJ)\nHunger Skateparks - Bloomington, IN (MAJ)\nGrindline Skateparks - Seattle, WA (MAJ)\nSpohn Ranch - Los Angeles, CA (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were established at $550,000.00 and the selected firm was deemed to be the most qualified. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended California Skateparks to be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nCalifornia Skateparks                 \n273 N.

Both construction projects are scheduled to be substantially complete by December 2021.\n \n \nBenefits to the Public: The Skatepark will update and expand recreation opportunities to residents near Tuttle Park and beyond.

They have been presented to and accepted by the Tuttle CRC and University District communities as important improvements to Tuttle Park. The conceptual design of the proposed skatepark was driven through community input and direct requests by the neighborhood. \n \nArea(s) Affected: University District (44), All communities connected to the Olentangy Trail will have easy access to this park since the trail directly connects to the park.\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by updating existing park infrastructure as requested by the community.
