    "description": "Title\n \n \nTo recognize March as Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month (DDAM) is a nationwide event to raise awareness about inclusion of people with developmental disabilities in all aspects of community life, and the barriers that people with disabilities still face.\n \nWHEREAS, during the Month of March, National Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month seeks to increase public awareness of the needs and the potential of Americans who face developmental disabilities and to provide the opportunities they need in order to live productive lives; and\n \nWHEREAS, 1963: President John F Kennedy signed the law that would eventually be known as the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (DD Act). Originating as an amendment, this bill was the first major piece of legislation to combat mental illness and intellectual disabilities; and\n \nWHEREAS, 1970: President Kennedy’s amendment was expanded and renamed. It became known as the Developmental Disabilities Services and Facilities Construction Amendment of 1970, making this the first law to introduce the term “developmental disability; and\n \nWHEREAS, 1975: This law became the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act in 1975 and was amended several times in the next decade. The 1975 amendment demonstrated a significant shift away from institutionalization and toward independence, as it introduced language requiring “habilitation in the least restrictive setting that maximizes developmental potential” and specified that public funds should not be provided; and\n \nWHEREAS, this annual recognition was established in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, developmental disabilities are defined as impairments in physical, learning, language, or behavior areas, which include Autism spectrum disorders, Cerebral Palsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual or learning disabilities, hearing loss, vision impairment, and other developmental delays; and\n  \nWHEREAS, we value what is important to people with disabilities and their families who are striving for everyday lives no different than that of all other citizens; now therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize March as Development Disabilities Awareness Month.",
