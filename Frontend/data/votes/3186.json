    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: Pulte Homes of Ohio, LLC and Harmony Development Group, LLC (together, the “Developers”) purchased or have options to purchase ±369.2 acres within Columbus near the intersection of Alton & Darby Creek Road and Renner Road (the “Developers’ Property”) in order to construct the “Sugar Farm” and “Renner South” residential developments in addition to public infrastructure improvements serving both of these areas. Pursuant to Ordinance 1557-2020, the Director of the Department of Development entered into the “Big Darby - Sugar Farm and Renner South Plan Agreement” dated March 10, 2021 with the Developers to outline the plans and respective commitments of the City and the Developers for the fulfillment of the “Big Darby Revenue Program” requirements as established by Resolution 0216X-2008, including but not limited to, establishing a new community authority (“NCA”) and new tax increment financing (“TIFs”). Resolution 0118X-2021 and Resolution 0243X-2021 established the Sugar Farm-Renner South NCA (“SFRS NCA”) according to Ohio Revised Code (“ORC”) Chapter 349 as a body politic and corporate within the boundaries of the Developers’ Property. The Developers and the City agreed the SFRS NCA would impose 6.5 mills on the Developers’ Property for thirty years. The NCA charges received from the 6.5 mills by the SFRS NCA will be allocated first to provide an allowance to cover administrative costs of the SFRS NCA, and the remaining balance (the “Available Charge Revenue”) will be used for public infrastructure improvements. Ordinance 3248-2021 established a new 30-year, 95% TIF area pursuant to ORC Section 5709.40(B) for the part of Sugar Farm including parcel number 203-304335 (the “Sugar Farm 40(B) TIF”). Following approval, pursuant to Ordinance 3319-2021, of the “County Compensation Agreement” with Franklin County required by ORC Section 5709.40(E), Ordinance 3259-2021 established two new 30-year, 95% TIF incentive districts pursuant to ORC Section 5709.40(C) for the remaining area of Sugar Farm (the “Sugar Farm Incentive District”) and for all of Renner South (the “Renner South Incentive District”). Service payments in lieu of taxes from these three TIFs (the “Service Payments”) will be first distributed by the county to the Hilliard City Schools and Tolles Career and Technical Center, and then, to the appropriate taxing authorities as required by ORC Section 5709.40(F). The remaining portion of the Service Payments will be distributed to the City for deposit into new TIF funds to use for compensating Norwich Township (the “Township”) and for public infrastructure improvements.\n \nIn order to implement the Big Darby Revenue Program and the Big Darby - Sugar Farm and Renner South Plan Agreement, this Ordinance will authorize the City to enter into: 1) the “Intergovernmental Cooperative Agreement” with the SFRS NCA in order for the City to accept the Available Charge Revenue for deposit into a new NCA fund, 2) the “Township Compensation Agreement” with the Township  to provide it  Service Payments equivalent to the amount of property taxes it would have received from its levies that are not otherwise directly available to the Township’s fire department and emergency medical services under ORC Section 5709.40, and 3) the “TIF & NCA Reimbursement Agreement” with the Developers to provide them reimbursement for eligible costs of public infrastructure improvements using the Available Charge Revenue and the remaining Service Payments after the City has first made payment to the Township (the “Available TIF Revenue”). \n \nThis Ordinance will also appropriate and authorize the expenditure of the Service Payments to the Township as well as appropriate and authorize the expenditure of the Available Charge Revenue and the Available TIF Revenue to the Developers pursuant to the respective terms and conditions of the Township Compensation Agreement and the TIF & NCA Reimbursement Agreement. It is contemplated that Pulte Homes of Ohio, LLC will receive the Available Charge Revenue and the Available TIF Revenues generated from Sugar Farm, and Harmony Development Group, LLC will receive the Available Charge Revenue and Available TIF Revenues from Renner South for reimbursement of each of the Developers’ respective costs of the public infrastructure improvements plus their corresponding accrued interest on those costs.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is required to allow for the immediate effectiveness of this ordinance, which is necessary to enable the immediate execution of the agreements contemplated herein to provide for the timely financing and redevelopment of the above described public infrastructure improvements already in process.\nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation. The City is appropriating and authorizing the expenditure of its received community development charges generated by the parcels in the Sugar Farm-Renner South NCA and the service payments in lieu of taxes generated by the parcels in the Sugar Farm 40(B) TIF, Sugar Farm Incentive District, and Renner South Incentive District, that are to be deposited in each new herein described NCA fund and TIF Funds, all in accordance with the Intergovernmental Cooperative Agreement, Township Compensation Agreement, and the TIF & NCA Reimbursement Agreement.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute and deliver the: 1) Intergovernmental Cooperative Agreement between the City and Sugar Farm-Renner South NCA, 2) Township Compensation Agreement between the City and Norwich Township; and 3) TIF & NCA Reimbursement Agreement between the City, Pulte Homes of Ohio, LLC, and Harmony Development Group, LLC, all for the benefit of implementing the Big Darby Revenue Program; to establish the Sugar Farm-Renner South NCA Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to accept the community development charges from the Sugar Farm-Renner South NCA and to deposit said funds into the Sugar Farm-Renner South NCA Fund pursuant to the Intergovernmental Cooperative Agreement;
