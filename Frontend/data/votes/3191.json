    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Rev1 Ventures for the purpose of partnering in the Diversity Equity & Inclusion Grant Fund Program.\n \nRev1 Ventures, formerly known as TechColumbus, is a seed stage venture development organization that combines investment capital and strategic services to help entrepreneurs build products that people want and companies that succeed.  Rev1 Ventures led a successful regional proposal to the State of Ohio to secure $18.7 million for the Entrepreneurial Signature Program (ESP) which accelerates the creation and growth of new technology companies in Central Ohio.  The City of Columbus has been a partner in support of the Rev1 Venture’s Entrepreneurial Support Program since 2007 by providing annual financial support.  Rev1 Ventures has also been a partner with the City of Columbus by providing grant and loans through the COVID Small Business Response and Recovery Program.       \n \nThe mission of the Rev1 Diversity Equity and Inclusion Grant Fund Program is to continue to provide support to the business community by leveling the playing field for underserved entrepreneurs and innovators.    \n \nThe grant fund will provide services which will include the following: (1) salary and benefits for underserved entrepreneurs/innovators for up to 1 year; (2) support for recruiting diverse CEO and key leaders; (3) support for early product development;  and (4) subsidized salary for hiring diverse interns and fellows through Rev1 Venture’s Innovative Internship Program.\n \nRev1 Ventures has announced its expansion of support for women and persons of color who are seeking to commercialize technologies and launch new scalable businesses in the Columbus Region.  The funding totals nearly $3MM in new programs, including a $1.4MM grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) “Build to Scale” program, which aims to accelerate technology entrepreneurship by increasing inclusive access to business support and startup capital.\n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current expertise and capacity to provide.\nEmergency action is requested to provide support to Rev1 Ventures in the launching of the new Diversity Equity & Inclusion Grant Fund Program and avoid disruption in services. \n   \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the Department of Development’s 2022 General Fund Budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Rev1 Venture’s contract compliance number is 011852 and it expires on 5/18/22.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract in an amount up to $100,000.00 with Rev1 Ventures for the purpose of partnering  in the Diversity Equity & Inclusion Grant Fund Program;
