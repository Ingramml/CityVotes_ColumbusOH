    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: In 2005 the Northland Alliance, the Morse Road SID Exploratory Committee, and the City of Columbus Development Department initiated an effort with property owners on Morse Road from Indianola Avenue to Cleveland Avenue to create a Special Improvement District (SID).  In 2006 the Morse Road SID was created for a term of ten (10) years. On March 14, 2016 a petition to reauthorize for another ten (10) years was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council by Ordinance No. 0611- 2016.  Another action required by the Ohio Revised Code is the approval of the Plan of Improvements and Services and the inclusion of City owned property in said plan. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0043X-2016, passed March 21, 2016. The third piece of legislation was to declare the necessity to implement the Plan of Services adopted by the Morse Road Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and to levy a special assessment for the services. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0098X-2016, passed May 2, 2016. A final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 1579-2016, passed June 20, 2016. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the District Plan.\n \nThis legislation appropriates and approves the expenditure of assessments collected in fiscal year 2022 that are to be returned to the SID. This legislation also allows the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Morse Road Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for disbursement of these funds in 2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for continuation of services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the Morse Road Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from Agency Fund 3309.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 001483 and contract compliance is pending.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Morse Road Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for the implementation of services set forth in the District Plan; to direct the City Auditor to appropriate and expend up to $305,000.00 from assessments levied from property owners; and to declare an emergency. ($305,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council approved the reauthorization and implementation of a plan for services for the Morse Road Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for a period of 10 years from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2026; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council has also levied assessments in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 1710 for such purposes, which funds are in the process of collection and are required by law to be distributed to the District by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the assessment funds collected by the County and forwarded to the City for disbursement will be available in March 2022 and September 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development, Economic Development Division, in that it is immediately necessary to appropriate and expend said funds to allow for continuation of services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare, NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with the Morse Road Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for the implementation of services for the operations requirements set forth in the District Plan previously approved by City Council pursuant to Resolution 0043X-2016, for an amount not to exceed $305,000.00.\n \nSection 2.
