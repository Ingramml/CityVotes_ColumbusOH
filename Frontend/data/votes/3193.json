    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: Chapter 1710 of the Ohio Revised Code, effective September 29, 1994 provides for the creation of Special Improvement Districts (SIDs), by non-profit corporations governed by trustees elected by the property owners for the provision of special services in a designated district. In 2017 a petition to create a new SID was approved by Council. The property owners initiated a one petition process in which the owners of at least 60% of the front footage of all real property located within in the East Main Street area between Bexley and Whitehall, acknowledging that they are interested in the creation of a Special Improvement District and they approve of the Plan for Improvements and Services to be provided by the East Main Street SID. This petition was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council by Ordinance 0765-2017, passed March 27, 2017. Another action required by the Ohio Revised Code is the approval of the Plan for Improvements and Services in said plan. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0071X-2017, passed April 3, 2017. The third piece of legislation was to declare the necessity to implement the Plan of Services adopted by the East Main Street SID, and to levy a special assessment for the services. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0147X-2017, passed May 15, 2017. A final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 1608-2017, passed July 10, 2017 for a 5-year term from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the District Plan.\n \nThis legislation appropriates and approves the expenditure of assessments collected in Fiscal Year 2022 that are to be returned to the SID.  This legislation also allows the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the East Main Street Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for disbursement of these funds in 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the East Main Street Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from Agency Fund 3313.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 025514 and expires on 4/23/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the East Main Street Special Improvement District for the implementation of services set forth in the District Plan; to direct the City Auditor to appropriate and expend up to $65,500.00 from assessments levied from property owners; and to declare an emergency. ($65,500.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council approved the creation and implementation of a plan for services for the East Main Street Special Improvement District for a period of 5 years from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council has also levied assessments in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 1710 for such purposes, which funds are in the process of collection and are required by law to be distributed to the District by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the assessment funds collected by the County and forwarded to the City for disbursement will be available in March 2022 and September 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation needs to be an emergency because the East Main SID needs this money to operate its organization and to fund its initiatives in a timely manner; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract to distribute such funds, and for the further preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare, NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with the East Main Street Special Improvement District, Inc. for implementation of services to fulfill   operations requirements set forth in the District Plan previously approved by City Council pursuant to Resolution 0071X-2017, for an amount not to exceed $65,500.00.\n \nSection 2.
