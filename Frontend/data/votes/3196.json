    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Short North Special Improvement District (SID) was created in 1998 for a term of 12 years through 2011. In 2011 the property owners sought and obtained reauthorization for a period of 5 years to be ending in 2016. In 2016 the SID was reauthorized for an additional 5 years to 2021. In 2021, the petition to reauthorize the SID for two 5-year terms ending December 2031, and the updated Articles of Incorporation were approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 0734-2021, passed March 29, 2021. City Council also approved the Plan for Improvements and Services to be provided by the Short North SID by Resolution No. 0046X-2021 passed April 5, 2021. The necessity to implement the Plan of Improvements and Services and to levy a special assessment for the improvements and services was approved by City Council by Resolution No. 0081-2021, passed May 10, 2021. A final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 2717-2021, passed October 18, 2021. A portion of each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the District Plan.\n \nThis legislation appropriates and approves the expenditure of that portion of assessments collected in FY 2022 that is to be returned to the SID. This legislation would also allow the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Short North Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for the disbursement of assessment collected by County Auditor from property owners in the District.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for continuation of services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the Short North Special Improvement District.
