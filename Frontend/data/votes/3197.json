    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: Chapter 1710 of the Ohio Revised Code, effective September 29, 1994 provides for the creation of Special Improvement Districts (SID), by non-profit corporations governed by trustees elected by the property owners for the provision of special services in a designated district. In 2015 a petition to create a new SID in the University area to be known as the University District Special Improvement District (District) was approved by Council for a 5-year term. In 2020 members of the SID approved a reauthorization to continue SID services. The property owners initiated a one petition process in which the owners of at least 60% of the area of all real property located within the District signed, acknowledging that they supported the reauthorization of the Special Improvement District and they approve of the Base Plan for Public Services and Improvements to be provided by the University District SID. This petition was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council by Ordinance 0800-2020, passed May 4, 2020, for a 5-year term. Another action required by the Ohio Revised Code is the approval of the Plan for Public Services and Improvements in said plan. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0066X-2020, passed May 18, 2020. The third piece of legislation was to declare the necessity to implement the Plan of Public Services and Improvements adopted by the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and to levy a special assessment for the services. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0102X-2020, passed June 29, 2020. A final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 1894-2020, passed September 14, 2020 for a 5-year term from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2025. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the Plan of Pubic Services and Improvements.\n \nThis legislation appropriates and approves the expenditure of that portion of assessments collected in FY 2022 that is to be returned to the SID.  This legislation would also allow the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the University District Special Improvement District for disbursements of these funds.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for continuation of services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the University District Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from Agency Fund 3311.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 016992 and contract compliance is pending.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for the implementation of services set forth in the Plan of Public Services and Improvements; to direct the City Auditor to appropriate and expend up to $400,000.00 from assessments levied from property owners; and to declare an emergency. ($400,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council approved in 2020 the creation and implementation of a Plan for Public Services and Improvements for the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for a period of 5 years from July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2026; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council has also levied assessments in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 1710 for such purposes, which funds are in the process of collection and are required by law to be distributed to the University District SID by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the assessment funds collected by the County and forwarded to the City for disbursement will be available in March 2022 and September 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development, Economic Development Division, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. appropriate and expend said funds to allow for continuation of services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and, NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for the implementation of services for the operations requirements set forth in the Plan of Public Services and Improvements previously approved by City Council pursuant to Resolution 0066X-2020, for an amount not to exceed $400,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That from the unappropriated monies and from all the monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, the sum not to exceed $400,000 is appropriated in Agency Fund 3311 in care of University District SID, under an assigned Object Class for Other Expenditure per the accounting codes.\n \nSECTION 3.                     That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $400,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 3311 in care of University District SID, under an assigned Object Class for Other Expenditure per the accounting codes.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
