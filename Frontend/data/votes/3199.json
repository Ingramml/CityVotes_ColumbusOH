    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Technology to modify and extend an existing agreement with Telvent USA LLC through extension of purchase order PO264150. No new or additional funds are associated with this extension. Rather, the extension makes the remaining funds on the above-referenced purchase order available for an additional year, to 4/8/2023.\n \nOn December 7, 2020, Ordinance 2182-2020 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), to enter into contract with Telvent USA LLC for professional services, software licensing and ArcFM software maintenance and support associated with DPU’s IVR Responder 10.8.1 upgrade project. Due to a shortage of resources, however, the project did not get fully underway in 2021. The original contract, associated with the above-mentioned ordinance, will expire on April 8 of this year. As such, DoT would like to extend it for one full year, through April 8, 2023, via the extension of purchase order PO264150. \n \nAs described in ordinance 2182-2020, DPU’s “Responder” system tracks and manages power outages and is an important customer management tool. The upgrade, described in ordinance 2182-2020, was procured in accordance with sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes, as Telvent USA LLC, is the sole provider of the software and services.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to ensure authorization of the requested extension prior to the expiration of the current contract/purchase order. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nNo additional costs are associated with this ordinance. Passage of this ordinance makes the remaining funds on the above-referenced purchase order available for an additional year, to 4/8/2023.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nTelvent USA LLC\nC.C. #/F.I.D #: 52 - 1366064                      Expiration Date: 12/22/2022\nDAX Vendor Account #: 009049\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilties, to modify and extend an existing agreement with Telvent USA LLC through extension of purchase order PO264150 through April 8, 2023, to authorize the use of any remaining funds/unspent balance existing on purchase order PO264150 and to declare an emergency.
