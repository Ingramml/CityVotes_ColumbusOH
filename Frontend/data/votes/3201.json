    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Technology to modify and extend an existing agreement with ConvergOne, Inc. through extension of purchase order PO272976. No new or additional funds are associated with this extension. Rather, the extension makes the remaining funds on the above-referenced purchase order available for an additional year, to 4/29/2023.\n \nOn April 26, 2021, Ordinance 0724-2021 authorized the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), to enter into contract with ConvergOne, Inc. for professional services and maintenance and support services associated with the Genesys Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. The on-going project was delayed somewhat while the city project team negotiated the statement of work with ConvergOne, Inc. Since the original contract, associated with the above-mentioned ordinance, will expire on April 29 of this year, DoT would like to extend it for one full year, through April 29, 2023, via the extension of purchase order PO272976.\n \nAs described in ordinance 0724-2021, the current IVR system is used by the city’s 311, Public Utilities, Building and Zoning Services, and Technology Help Desk call centers.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to ensure authorization of the requested extension prior to the expiration of the current contract/purchase order.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nNo additional costs are associated with this ordinance. Passage of this ordinance makes the remaining funds on the above-referenced purchase order available for an additional year, to 4/29/2023.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE 411763228\nConvergeOne Inc.\nC.C. #/F.I.D #: 41-1763228                      Expiration Date: 10/31/2021\nDAX Vendor Account #: 007864\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilties, to modify and extend an existing agreement with ConvergOne, Inc. through extension of purchase order PO272976 through April 29, 2023, to authorize the use of any remaining funds/unspent balance existing on purchase order PO272976 and to declare an emergency.
