    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. to add additional funds for the design of the Signals - General Engineering Signals (2018) in the amount of $350,000.00.\nOrdinance 1871-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Signals - General Engineering Signals (2018) project.  Ordinance 0378-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $94,356.00.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $350,000.00.\n \nThis modification is necessary to update and complete the design process for the Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project.  In 2014, Burgess & Niple, Inc. were contracted for the design portion of the Front and Marconi project and it is now necessary to bring the plans up to current standards.  This project consists of converting Front Street from Broad Street to Hickory Street and Marconi Boulevard from Broad Street to Spring Street to a two-way operation and upgrading all signals within the project limits to decorative downtown standard. Project includes installation of new granite curb, buff wash sidewalk, street and pedestrian lighting, enhanced pedestrian crossings and landscaping beds.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $300,000.00     (PO136168, Ord. 1871-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $  94,356.00     (PO159366, Ord. 0378-2019)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $350,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $744,356.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Burgess & Niple, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Burgess & Niple, Inc. is CC004425 and expires 02/09/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $8,709.40 is available within Fund 2223, the Special Purpose Fund.  This will need to be appropriated.\n \nThe remaining funding is available and appropriated in Fund 7704, Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner, to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to appropriate funds within the Special Purpose Fund;  to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Burgess & Niple, Inc. in connection with the Signal Installation - General Engineering Signals (2018) project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $350,000.00 from the Special Purpose Fund and the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($350,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
