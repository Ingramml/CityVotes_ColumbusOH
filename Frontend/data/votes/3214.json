    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with KNS Services, Inc. (KNS) for continued security camera services and equipment in accordance with the sole source procurement provisions of City Code Chapter 329. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $102,000.00.\n \nKNS has provided surveillance system installation and repair for the department for many years.  They also service many other city departments including Public Safety, Finance, and Public Utilities. They have established a unique relationship with the Department of Technology to provide robust service to multiple departments in the city. The City of Columbus selected the Genetec software platform years ago for all departments to utilize for their surveillance systems with the vision of aggregating these services citywide. This effort has resulted in KNS becoming the provider of these services for several departments as Genetec requires the equipment to be maintained by KNS Services to avoid a situation where multiple vendors are given security clearance to access and make changes to the system. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department owns 55 unique surveillance systems comprised of 508 cameras around the city.  The Genetec platform provides remote viewing, access management, and organizational integration.  In the past we have had several staff involved in keeping these systems monitored and repaired, in addition to the contracted help of KNS.  The task has simply become too great for our staff to keep up with and we need professional help in the way of system function checks and priority service response. This contract accomplishes that by have KNS personnel do system function checks on our systems twice weekly, immediately dispatching repairs on no-functioning components of the system as they are discovered. While Recreation and Parks site managers will continue to keep an eye on their systems and report issues that arise, the new arrangement with KNS will allow for greater efficiencies. The contract will help keep and down time for security and surveillance to a minimum, making our sites safer for staff and visitors.  \n \nThis contract not only gets a quicker response time for repairs, but also gains access to a 24/7 emergency response in the event of a serious crime or occurrence. If the system is having issues of recall or playback, these are frequently network and/or hardware issues that require a trained technician to pull up video history. In addition, this contract will establish a more robust stock of cameras, digital recording units, switches, and equipment for immediate deployment and will improve our security system overall. We have had instances where delays in receiving replacement components have resulted in systems being inoperable for weeks. Having the replacement equipment available immediately will minimize these extended downtimes. This contract includes $52,000.00 to cover the cost of these services, billed monthly, as well as $50,000.00 for new security equipment to replace failing components, for a total contract of $102,000.00. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nKNS Services, Inc.\n8450 Rausch Drive\nPlain City, OH 43064\nNathan Bladen, 614-733-3880\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005443, 31-1460220\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 8, 2023                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the execution of this contract before April 2022, to avoid a lapse in coverage, continuing the safety and surveillance of our facilities and parks.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract will provide higher reliability of all of our surveillance systems to assist in minimizing crime in our facilities and parks.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: We receive hundreds of calls from citizens regarding safety in parks every year.
