    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an annual service agreement with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for the Orion Project Management Information System Support Services application for use by the Departments of Public Utilities, Finance, Development, Public Service, and Recreation and Parks.  The Orion Project Management Information System (PMIS) is a web-based electronic project management system to facilitate supervision and administration of projects, contracts, tasks, budget, and schedules along with construction documents such as Submittals, Requests for Information, Request for Proposals, and Pay Applications via the Construction Management side of the program.  PMIS support services and upgrade enhancements are ongoing and additional funding has been provided as modification to prior contracts.  The agreement for this service will be established in accordance with the pertinent provisions for Sole Source Procurement of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \n \nThe City of Columbus began using a software solution for capital project management under the Professional Program Management contract for the Department of Public Utilities’ Wet Weather Program in 2006.  PMIS was highly effective, and the City determined that expanded use of PMIS could potentially benefit other divisions within the Department of Public Utilities and other City departments as well.  A consultant, Red Oak, was retained to assist the City in assessing its current interim PMIS, and providing a decision framework for determining how best to expand use of such a system city-wide. The PMIS assessment project consisted of engaging with City stakeholders, clarifying goals, determining functional and technical requirements for PMIS, and performing initial analysis of potential software solutions.  From a list of approximately 30 different solutions, Red Oak performed a screening process and identified four solutions that met City requirements. The City invited vendors to make software demonstrations and preliminary cost proposals. From this information, the City was able to determine that the current PMIS, developed by Malcolm-Pirnie (now Arcadis U.S., Inc.) could be cost-effectively expanded to serve the needs of both the Department of Public Utilities and other departments city-wide.\n \nThis contract renewal is for one year from the date of execution, with the option to renew annually based upon mutual agreement, budgeted funds, and approval by City Council.  \n \nSUPPLIER: Arcadis U.S., Inc.
