($100,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nNeed:  This ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase a contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice (ForPsych) for psychological screening of public safety recruits for upcoming classes, beginning in 2022, at the Police Academy and the Fire Academy.\n \nThe Civil Service Commission needs to increase the maximum authorized expenditure in the current contract with ForPsych in order to add funds for upcoming screening services. Funding is typically added annually or prior to each academy class. The contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes since this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process.\n \nBid Information:  The City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ019812) for these services and accepted proposals through October 8, 2021.  Three proposals were received by the deadline. An evaluation committee reviewed all proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP which included quality and feasibility of proposals, cost, competence, ability, past performance and timeliness of reporting results.  \n \nBased upon the committee’s review and ranking of the submitted proposals, it was determined that ForPsych was the best and most responsive bidder for the required services.  Therefore, the Commission awarded the contract to ForPsych for the psychological assessment services beginning January 1, 2022.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested in order to increase the contract immediately so that needed assessment services can be completed for police and fire academy classes anticipated to begin in June 2022 and thereafter.\n \nContract Compliance Number:  CC033463, expires October 1, 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these services was partially budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2022 General Fund budget, and can be covered by available Object Class 03 funds previously appropriated to the Commission.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the psychological screening of public safety recruits; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2021, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for psychological screening services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded a contract to ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice based upon the submissions of RFQ019812; and,\n \nWHEREAS, to date, twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) have been authorized to ForPsych for the provision of psychological screening services; and\n \nWHEREAS the current contract is insufficient to pay for upcoming services needed to fill 2022 academy classes and it is therefore now necessary to increase the current contract with ForPsych; and,\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to modify and increase the contract with ForPsych in order to continue scheduling police and fire recruits in preparation for summer academy classes, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be, and is hereby, authorized to modify and increase the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the purpose of administering psychological screenings to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the additional expenditure of $100,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
