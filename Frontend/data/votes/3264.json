    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: In 2005 the Discovery District Development Corporation asked Capitol South Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation to initiate an effort to work with Discovery District property owners to create a Special Improvement District (SID) on the east side of downtown. Property owners were surveyed and overwhelmingly were in support of seeing a proposal to create a SID. The SID was created for an initial five-year period, was very successful and reauthorized in 2010 & 2015 and again in 2020 with City Council’s consent. \n \nIn 2020, a one petition process was initiated in which property owners representing at least 60% of the front feet within the District signed that they were interested in reauthorizing the SID and they approved of the Plan for Services delineating the services to be provided by the SID.  The petition was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council’s Ordinance No. 0808-2020, passed May 4, 2020. Subsequently, two additional Resolutions were approved by the City Council; 0068X-2020 on May 18, 2020 and 0101X-2020 on June 29, 2020.  The final action as required by Chapter 1710 of the Ohio Revised code to reauthorize the SID, Ordinance 1893-2020, was approved by the City Council on September 14, 2020. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the Plan for Services.\n \nThis legislation appropriates and approves the expenditure of assessments collected in fiscal year 2022 that are to be returned to the SID. This legislation also allows the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Discovery Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for disbursement of these funds in 2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for continuation of services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the Discovery Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from Agency Fund 3310.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 001286 and expires on 1/23/2024.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Discovery Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for the implementation of services set forth in the Plan for Services; to direct the City Auditor to appropriate and expend up to $1,000,000.00 from assessments levied from property owners; and to declare an emergency.
