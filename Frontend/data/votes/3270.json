The reconstruction will include installing new curb, full pavement reconstruction, reconstruction and modification to the existing median on the east leg of the I-71 at the Hudson Street intersection, sidewalk on the north side, a shared used path on the south side, street trees, new traffic signals, storm sewers, a new 24” water main, new ADA curb ramps at intersections, and other work as may be necessary to complete the contract in accordance with the plans and specifications set forth in the Bid Submittal Documents.\n \nThe estimated Notice to Proceed date is March 14, 2022.  The project was let by the Office of Support Services through Vendor Services and Bid Express.  Two bids were received on January 27, 2022, (all majority) and tabulated as follows:   \n      \nCompany Name                                 Bid Amount               City/State                                                Majority/MBE/FBE     \nComplete General Construction                     $17,631,863.27                     Columbus, OH                     MAJ\nTrucco Construction Co., Inc.                     $22,180,252.38                     Delaware, OH                     MAJ\n \nAward is to be made to Complete General Construction Company as the lowest responsive and responsible and best bidder for their bid of $17,631,863.27.  The amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $1,763,186.33.  The total legislated amount is $19,395,049.60. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against US Utility Contractor Company.\n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Complete General Construction Company is CC006056 and expires 6/8/2023.\n \n3. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nComplete General Construction Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nA portion of this project is reimbursable through the Ohio Public Works Commission in the amount of $1,894,154.88.  This amount will need to be appropriated within the Transportation Grants Fund, Fund 7763, Grant G592004 (Hudson St - I71 to Cleveland Ave CC10X-CC11X). \n \nA portion of the remaining balance is reimbursable through a grant from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) of $734,622.30.  This amount will need to be appropriated within the General Government Grants Fund, Fund 2220, Grant G592201 (Hudson St - I71 to Cleveland Ave ODNR).  This grant with ODNR is contingent upon the receipt of a final executed agreement.  The grant agreement is scheduled to appear before the State Controlling Board for final approval March 7, 2022.  \n \nA portion of the balance will be funded with Division of Water funding in an amount of up to $3,662,351.54. A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund, Fund 6006 will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.  Funds are appropriated.\n \nA portion of the balance will be funded with Department of Public Service funding.  $1,642,404.00 is budgeted, appropriated, and available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, Project P530103-100068 (Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Hudson Street-I71 to Cleveland Avenue). \n \nThe remaining balance of the Public Service funding for this project is budgeted within the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget, which has been approved by Council under Ordinance 2707-2021.  The funds will not be available to Public Service until the proceeds of the bond sale are available later this year.  Therefore, it is necessary to certify the Public Service funds in the amount of $11,461,516.88 against the Special Income Tax Fund.  Funds will need to be appropriated within the Special Income Tax fund and then transferred to the Streets and Highways Bond Fund where they will also need to be appropriated.  \n \n5.
