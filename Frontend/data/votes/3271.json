These positions directly affect the Department’s ability to develop and deliver services and capital improvement projects throughout the system, directly impacting the community’s desire for accessible, safe, updated, user friendly, and well maintained programming, amenities, facilities, trees, parkland, golf courses, and sports fields.\nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested in order to have this equipment delivered and available as soon as possible in 2022 and beyond. It has been realized that, due to supply chain concerns impacting equipment globally, some equipment orders are projected to take a year or more to be fulfilled. This ordinance is establishing the funding required for the equipment being purchased and will allow the Recreation and Parks Department to order equipment needed over the next two years, allowing as much equipment to be put into service as soon as possible in the current challenging environment. Equipment will be ordered immediately upon the approval of this ordinance and resulting purchase orders. The staff expansions supported by this ordinance will allow the Department to develop and deliver capital improvement projects in a more efficient manner moving forward, as soon as the positions can be filled. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Amenities, facilities, trees, parkland, golf courses, and sports fields maintained and improved by the Recreation and Parks Department enhance the quality of life of our citizens. The equipment and staff that this ordinance supports will allow for the continued maintenance and improvements of these amenities.\n \nCommunity Input Issues: The community has expressed a desire for accessible and well-maintained amenities, trees, parks, golf courses, and sports fields.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This funding will support the mission of the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to ensure that amenities, facilities, trees, parkland, golf courses, and sports fields remain accessible, safe, updated, user friendly, and well maintained. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will increase the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 balance by $4,100,476.00. $4,100,476.00 is available from the unappropriated monies in the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $4,100,476.00 from the unappropriated balance in the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund for the purchase of equipment and to support staff expansions for the Recreation and Parks Department; to authorize and direct the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $3,781,500.00 for the purchase of equipment for the Recreation and Parks Department; to authorize and direct the Director of Recreation and Parks and the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, to enter into various contracts for the purchase of equipment; to authorize the expenditure of $4,100,476.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
