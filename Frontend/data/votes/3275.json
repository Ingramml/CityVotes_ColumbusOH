    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus received funds for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n \nThe HOPWA program provides for the implementation of long-term comprehensive strategies for meeting the housing needs of low income persons with HIV/AIDS and their families.  Eligible activities include providing housing information services; resource identification; acquisition, rehabilitation, conversion, lease, and repair of facilities to provide housing and services; new construction of housing units; project or tenant-based rental assistance; short-term rent, mortgage and utility payments; supportive services; technical assistance and administrative support.  The Board of Health will contract with various community agencies to provide these services.\n \nLancaster Fairfield Community Action Agency (Contract Compliance No. 316060695), LSS Faith Mission (CC No. 314412586), and Licking County Coalition for Housing (CC No. 311369756) all submitted proposals during an RFQ process completed in August, 2019 (RFQ012772).  These agencies are the only providers at this time who specialize exclusively in assisting income-eligible individuals/households living with HIV/AIDS in the eight county EMSA.  These contracts are for the third year of a five year contract period.  These agencies are nonprofit organizations and are therefore exempt from certification.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delays in providing program services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  These contracts are entirely funded by grant awards from HUD.  This grant does not generate revenue or require a City match.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into contracts with various community agencies for the provision of eligible HOPWA services for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022;
