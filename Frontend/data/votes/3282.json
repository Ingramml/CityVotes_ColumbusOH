    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a grant agreement with Community Refugee & Immigrant Services (CRIS) in support of its Victims of Crime Program.\n \nCRIS’s Victims of Crime Program works alongside survivors to build safety plans, promote connection, restoration, and wellness, and to ensure full and equitable access to the justice system. It provides court accompaniment to survivors to ensure they are able to attend court dates and coordinate communication with prosecutors, civil attorneys, interpreters and court advocates while also educating survivors on their rights, laws, systems and processes. It helps individuals and families reach economic stability and ensure that basic needs are being met. It also engages in systems advocacy: identifying barriers created by institutional practices and advocate specific improvements that will promote a more welcoming and equitable city for all survivors. The targeted constituencies are foreign-born individuals and families who have experienced victimization in Columbus. Primary populations include Bhutanese, Arab, Hispanic , Latino, Congolese, Somali, Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Afghan communities. Program activities fall under three categories: individual advocacy, outreach, and community education. The proposed budget amendment will allow CRIS to increase staff hours and hire a new full time bilingual advocate in support of the program.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this grant agreement is available within the Reimagine Safety subfund.\n \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested in order to immediately provide resources necessary to support the Victims of Crime Program for New American communities.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a grant agreement with Community Refugee & Immigrant Services (CRIS) in support of the Victims of Crime Program; to authorize an appropriation of $53,000.00 within the Reimagine Safety subfund; to authorize a transfer, appropriation, and expenditure within the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
