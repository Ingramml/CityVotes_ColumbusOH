    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The need exists to amend Ordinance No. 1987-2021 (the “Ordinance”), approved by Columbus City Council on July 26, 2021.  The Ordinance authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement (“the Agreement”) with FlightSafety International Inc. (the “Grantee”).  An amendment is now required to revise the 90-day window needed to execute the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement and to revise the project site location.  \n \nThe Ordinance authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement for an annual cash payment equal to (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees and (ii) thirty percent (30%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees, who are also City of Columbus residents for a term of up to five (5) consecutive years on the estimated job creation of 113 net new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of $10,130,000 and the retention of 32 full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of $6,784,416 to be located at 4010 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-293794 (the “Project Site”).\n \nPrior to the execution of the Agreement, in a written communication received from the Grantee dated February 8, 2022, the Department of Development was notified that the Project Site had changed. The Project Site address is now 3100 Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-282381. The Grantee is requesting the Ordinance be amended to replace 4010 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-293794 with 3100 Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-282381 as the Project Site associated with the Agreement.  This change will not impact the scope of the project as authorized by Columbus City Council.  All job retention, job creation, and investment commitments remain unchanged.\nThis legislation is requested to be considered as an emergency in order to (i) revise the 90-day period needed to execute the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement to 90-days after passage from this ordinance, and (ii) to revise the Project Site from 4010 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-293794 to 3100 Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-282381 in order to allow FlightSafety International Inc. to begin investing and creating jobs as quickly as possible, and the related Agreement can be executed without undue delay, thereby allowing FlightSafety International Inc. to make use of the incentive.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 1987-2021, approved by Columbus City Council July 26, 2021, for the purposes of (i) revising the 90-day period needed to execute the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement to 90 days after passage from this ordinance, and (ii) to revise the Project Site from 4010 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-293794 to 3100 Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-282381; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the need exists to amend Ordinance No. 1987-2021, which was approved by Columbus City Council on July 26, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Ordinance authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with FlightSafety International Inc. for an annual cash payment equal to (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees and (ii) thirty percent (30%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees for a term of up to five (5) consecutive years on the estimated job creation of 463 new full-time permanent positions to be located at 4010 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-293794 (the “Project Site”); and\n \nWHEREAS, prior to the execution of the Agreement, in a written communication received from the Grantee dated February 8, 2022, the Department of Development was notified that the Project Site had changed.
