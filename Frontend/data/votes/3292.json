    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The need exists to amend Ordinance No. 2658-2021 (the “Ordinance”), approved by Columbus City Council on November 15, 2021.  The Ordinance authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement (“the Agreement”) with NetJets Inc. (the “Grantee”).  An amendment is now required to revise the 90-day window needed to execute the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement, revise the project site and add three additional entities as grantees to the Agreement.  \n \nThe Ordinance authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement for an annual cash payment equal to (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees and (ii) thirty percent (30%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees, who are also City of Columbus residents for a term of up to five (5) consecutive years on the estimated job creation of 154 net new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of $12,735,000 and the retention of 1,516 full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of $126,231,635 to be located at 4111 Bridgeway Park, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-290126 (the “Project Site”).\n \nPrior to the execution of the Agreement, in written communications received from the Grantee dated February 8, 2022 and March 10, 2022, the Department of Development was notified that the Project Site was incorrectly legislated with the wrong site address. The correct Project Site address should have been 4111 Bridgeway Avenue not 4111 Bridgeway Park, and that an additional location on the Grantee’s campus needs to be added to the Project Site. The Grantee will create and retain employees in two separate facilities that are jointly connected, but have two different addresses. Furthermore, three additional entities will partake in employing people at the Project Site - NetJets Aviation, Inc., NetJets Services, Inc. and NJS145 LLC. The Grantee is requesting the Ordinance be amended to replace 4111 Bridgeway Park, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-290126 with 4111 and 4151 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel numbers 010-290126, 010-290128 and 010-290129 collectively known as the Project Site associated with the Agreement and to add NetJets Aviation, Inc., NetJets Services, Inc., and NJS145 LLC as additional Grantees to the Agreement.  This change will not impact the scope of the project as authorized by Columbus City Council.  All job retention, job creation, and investment commitments remain unchanged.\nThis legislation is requested to be considered as an emergency in order to (i) revise the 90-day period needed to execute the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement to 90-days after passage from this ordinance, (ii) to revise the Project Site from 4111 Bridgeway Park, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-290126 to 4111 and 4151 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel numbers 010-290126, 010-290128 and 010-290129 and (iii) add three additional entities as grantees to the Agreement in as expedient a manner as possible so as to allow for the inclusion of the employees located at these additional entities for the reporting and compliance purposes. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance 2658-2021, approved by Columbus City Council on November 15, 2021, for the purposes of (i) revising the 90-day period needed to execute the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement to 90 days after passage from this ordinance, (ii) to revise the Project Site from 4111 Bridgeway Park, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-290126 to 4111 and 4151 Bridgeway Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel numbers 010-290126, 010-290128 and 010-290129 and (iii) add NetJets Aviation, Inc., NetJets Services, Inc., and NJS145 LLC as additional Grantees to the Agreement; and to declare an emergency.
