    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Centrex services with AT & T.  This contract provides for Centrex telephone services throughout the City.  This modification is necessary to add three (3) years to the term of the contract.  The contract, PO007157 was established without competitive bidding under the authority of Ordinance No. 0427-2016 and will expire March 31, 2022.\n \nNo additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested. There is no change in the services being procured.  The original terms and conditions remain in effect, except length of term.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency because negotiations compressed the time to gain contract approvals.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  City agencies must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the contract for the option to purchase Centrex services with AT & T, and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Centrex services for use citywide; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing Universal Term Contract with AT & T, to include three (3) years of service, expiring March 31, 2025; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the contract in order to keep Centrex services consistent and for the option to obtain additional years of service, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify a contract for option to obtain Centrex services with AT & T.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
