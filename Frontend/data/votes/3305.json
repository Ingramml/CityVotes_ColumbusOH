    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Resource International to provide engineering services associated with the Glenwood Park Natural Area Improvements Project. The contract amount is $77,080.00, with a contingency of $15,000.00, for a total of $92,080.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD) sought proposals from qualified consulting firms for professional design and engineering services for the Glenwood Park Natural Area Improvements Project. Glenwood Park is located at 1888 Fairmont Avenue, in the Hilltop Neighborhood, and the park consists of 16.7 acres in a west central location of the City. The park contains approximately 8.7 acres of developed land with a recreational facility and swimming pool. There is approximately 8 acres of undeveloped wooded terrain. \n \nFor years, the local community has advocated for beautification of the Greater Hilltop Area as presented in the Envision Hilltop: A Community Plan for Shared Success (https://www.envisionhilltop.com/). Neighborhood volunteer groups, including Friends of Glenwood Park and the Highland West Civic Association, have partnered with the City to remove litter, invasive plant species, as well as dead, dying, and diseased trees. These efforts reflect the Hilltop Community’s desire to revitalize this underutilized acreage of Glenwood Park. The overarching goal with improving Glenwood Park includes, creating more access, improving line of sight, and enhancing overall site safety for the community.  \n \nThe entire 16.7-acre property is divided into three (3) separate physiographic areas. The existing Glenwood Community Center and Pool are in a relatively high flat topographic land space that is higher than West Broad Street, defined as the Upper Terrace. Along the land slope there is an intermediate perched flat area, defined as the Middle Terrace. An existing natural trail clearing and former roadway is evident along the Middle Terrace with a buried stone staircase down to the bottom of the slope. The lower wooded terrain and wooded land slope, defined as the Lowland Area, is relatively equal to or lower in elevation to Broad Street. The Lowland Area is the primary focus of this project. This project includes, but is not limited to, trail design, wetland enhancement, park signage, park amenities, park boundaries, street frontage and aesthetics.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were requested from pre-qualified architecture and engineering firms that were pre-qualified internally through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process outlined by Ordinance 2050-2020.
