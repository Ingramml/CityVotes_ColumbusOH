    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Urban League in support of the organization’s Building Futures and Driving Futures training programs.\n \nBuilding Futures and Driving Futures are workforce development programs administered by the Columbus Urban League in partnership with the Columbus/Central Ohio Building and Construction Trades Council. The programs benefit residents who have been traditionally underserved, underemployed, or economically disadvantaged and creates paths to the middle class.\n \nBuilding Futures is a 12-week program that provides the skills necessary to begin a career in the region’s booming construction industry. No experience in the construction industry is necessary or required to apply. This career pathway will provide participants with a great starting wage, health benefits, and retirement benefits. Successful conclusion of the Building Futures program provides a pathway to a registered apprenticeship program in a wide variety of affiliated trades.\n \nDriving Futures is an 8-week program through which previously incarcerated and underemployed people receive training and career placement after earning their Class A Commercial Driver’s License. This program helps fill critically needed positions while creating true economic mobility for participants. After the 8-week program, drivers embark on a career with one of many affiliated trades employers - all providing a great starting wage, health, and retirement benefits.\n \nThis grant agreement will support the continued renovation of the Building Futures and Driving Futures training facility, including a technical classroom for Building Futures and a traditional classroom for Driving Futures. A dedicated training space for participants and staff will allow for the highest level of training with advanced technology and innovative instructional delivery.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure the timely funding is available for the provision of the Driving Futures program and the continued renovation of the training facility.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Urban League to support the organization’s Building Futures and Driving Futures programs; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
