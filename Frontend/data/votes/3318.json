Since its founding in 1986, CALMC has worked with many private and public sector companies and organizations and their unions to help them achieve their goals through the active involvement of its members and through effective training, communications, and leadership to benefit the citizens of Central Ohio. City Council has supported CALMC in the past to make strategic investments in projects that will ultimately create and retain jobs within the City.\n \nIn addition, CALMC assists employers and employees work together in areas such as problem solving, team building, and leadership which increases employees' skill levels so they will be more employable, have a voice in workplace operations and enhance the leadership abilities of both current leaders and future leaders. These services require expertise that cannot be provided by current city employees.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available for this transfer in the Department of Finance and Management general fund.\n \nEmergency Action:  Emergency action is being requested to allow for work by the CALMC to begin as soon as possible. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer of funds from the general fund, Finance and Management Department, to the Human Resources Department, employee benefits fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Human Resources to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee for the provision of training and assistance to promote improved labor-management relations; and to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the Employee Benefits fund and to declare an emergency.  ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Columbus Area Labor-Management Committee (CALMC) is a not-for-profit organization that promotes the development of high-performance organizations through joint participation of labor and management; and\n \nWHEREAS, since its founding in 1986, CALMC has worked with many private and public sector companies and organizations and their unions to help them achieve their goals through the active involvement of its members and effective training, communications, and leadership to benefit the citizens of Central Ohio; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the appropriate and transfer of funds from the general fund in the Finance and Management Department to the employee benefits fund in the Human Resources Department; and\n \nWHEREAS, sufficient funding is available in the Department of Finance and Management to transfer to the employee benefits fund for the purpose of funding this contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with CALMC in order to begin providing services to the Department as soon as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now therefore,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
