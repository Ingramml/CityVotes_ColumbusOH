    "description": "Explanation\n1.  Background\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with The Ohio State University (OSU) to affect the transfer of public right-of-way from the City to OSU, to execute other documents as needed to transfer the right-of-way, and to authorize the acceptance of the monies owed to the City pursuant to the actions delineated herein.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Cindy Kennedy, OSU Assistant Director of Real Estate - Operations, to sell an approximate 144,009± square foot portion (3.306+/- acres) of the 11th Avenue area right-of-way.  This portion of right-of-way is described as the following:\n \na.  West 11th Avenue - East/west directionally and is abutting North High Street at the east and Neil Avenue at the west.\nb.  Worthington Street - North/south directionally and is abutting West 11th Avenue at the north and West 10th Avenue at the south.\nc.  Highland Street - North/south directionally and is abutting West 11th Avenue at the north and West 10th Avenue at the south.\nd.  Un-named Alley - At approximately the mid-way north/south point of the requested portion of Highland Street, the un-named alley heads west (toward Worthington Street) for approximately 175 feet and at that point takes a 90 degree turn south (toward 10th Avenue) for 95 feet and at that point makes a 90 degree turn (toward Highland Street) for approximately 30 feet.\ne.  Un-named Alley - North/south directionally and abutting to West 10th Avenue at the north and West 9th Avenue at the south.\n \nSale of this right-of-way will allow OSU to provide safer routes for the CABS bus services and to incorporate the streets and alleys into university master planning efforts.\n \nThe Department of Public Service has agreed to sell the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal descriptions and exhibits (Attachments 1-5 & Exhibits 1-3) and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  Per current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way.  A value of $9.00 per square foot, or $1,296,084.24, was established.  OSU requested mitigation of this amount to $400,000.00 due to OSU committing to continue public access of the rights-of-way, the retention by the City of a general utility easement, and that the land is not being sought to facilitate private development or for the purpose of generating revenue for OSU.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on August 19, 2021.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to mitigate the land cost and recommended the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to OSU at the cost of $400,000.00.\n \nThe Department of Public Service also has agreed to remove ninety City-owned parking meters from the vacated streets contingent upon the promise of OSU to pay the City the sum of $728,921.14, which represents the projected revenue generated from those meters in the coming five-year period.     \n \nIn addition to a quit claim deed and other incidental instruments to be prepared by the City Attorney’s Office for the transfer of the land, it is necessary to execute a right-of-way acquisition and maintenance agreement with OSU to provide for the ongoing maintenance, repair, and improvement of the right-of-way transferred to OSU. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe City will receive $400,000.00 as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way, to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650.  The City will also receive $728,921.14 as consideration for lost parking revenue to be deposited in Fund 6500, Subfund 650001.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute any and all necessary agreements with OSU as soon as reasonably practicable to allow OSU to start and complete planned improvement work in the area while students are on break beginning in May. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary to transfer a portion of right-of-way in the vicinity of West 11th Avenue to The Ohio State University and to execute a contract with the university for future responsibilities concerning the right-of-way; to authorize the acceptance of funds from the university for the right-of way transfer and for lost parking meter revenue; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from The Ohio State University to sell an approximate 144,009± square foot portion (3.306+/- acres) of the West 11th Avenue area right-of-way;
