    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the contract and continue payments for the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System in accordance with the existing contract with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC as authorized by Ordinance 2311-2021.\n \nCurrently, the CoGo system has over 600 bikes and 88 stations throughout the city, averaging over 50,000 rides per year. The CoGo Bike Share system is popular with system members, tourists, residents, special event attendees, downtown employees, and students as it offers an alternative transit option in Columbus. The bike share system offers a unique low cost way to complete short trips without the use of a car. The health benefits of active transportation are well recognized as well. The system has also expanded into neighborhoods where access to a bike can offer an important transportation option. \n \nIt has been determined that it is necessary to assist in the funding of the operation and management of the bike sharing program. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the system has experienced a negative economic impact to its business operations. This ordinance will authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to continue making monthly payments to support the CoGo Bike Share System in accordance with the existing contract with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. This will allow the system to remain in place while the department seeks to secure a long-term sponsor to fund the system. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nLyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC \n185 Berry Street, Suite 5000\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\nMiller Nuttle, mnuttle@lyft.com\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 040364, 20-8809830\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: December 8, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that this funding can be made available immediately in order to continue sustainable operation of the bike share system in 2022. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The bike share system improves access to trails, greenway corridors, parks, jobs, events, and attractions throughout the City while improving the environmental health of the City.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: -------CoGo Bike Share continues to be a highly recognized and well-used system of bikes available for use by the general public. The community has expressed support for expanding access while continuing to keep the ride costs affordable for all and maintaining high quality customer service for users. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by removing access and circulation barriers to city parks, destinations, and trails. \n \nFiscal Impact: The Amended Agreement requires a payment of $65.00 per bike dock per month and this ordinance authorizes the Recreation and Parks Department to continue monthly payments to Lyft. This ordinance will provide $1,010,000.00 in funding to make these payments. $1,010,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recovery Fund 2209 to meet the financial obligations of these payments. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify the existing contract for the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC; and to authorize the expenditure of $1,010,000.00 from the Recovery Fund 2209; and to declare an emergency.
