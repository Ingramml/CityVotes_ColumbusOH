    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director  to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this legislation with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement established with Axon Enterprise, Inc. for the purchase of body worn cameras, In-car, interview room cameras and associated accessories, software, maintenance, and support for the Columbus Division of Police.  These video camera systems are typically utilized by law enforcement to record interactions with the public. This technology promotes both transparency and accountability. The contract may be extended for up to two additional one (1) year periods, subject to mutual agreement by both parties. \nThe initial body-worn camera (BWC) program was initiated in 2015 by then City Council President Andrew J. Ginther. A committee comprised of community members, academia, the Fraternal Order of Police, and support staff from the Department of Public Safety and City Attorney’s Office: (1) promulgated policies for deployment, public records retention, and redaction by reviewing and evaluating virtually every BWC policy in the nation; and (2) purchased first-generation Body-Worn cameras from the vendor WatchGuard, who were later purchased by Motorola and now operate under that name. \nSince 2016, approximately 3,470,283 body camera videos (over 593 TB) have been taken with these Motorola cameras. The millions of videos taken are public records thanks to the City's work leading to the passage of Ohio House Bill 425, which declared police videos to be public records. This legislation is nationally recognized as a model for effectively balancing transparency for the public and individual privacy.\nTo bring the next generation of video technology to the Columbus Division of Police, the Department of Public Safety assembled a multi-disciplinary team comprised of internal and external stakeholders with expertise and experience in technology, finance, law enforcement, procurement, and legal. Included on the team was President of the Columbus Chapter of the NAACP, Nana Watson, who gave invaluable community insight to this initiative. A solicitation was published in early 2021, seeking competitive proposals from nationally recognized camera system providers.\n \nBid Information:   RFQ019158 was advertised and Best Value Procurement proposals were received on August 12, 2021.  Six (6) responses with pricing were received.\nAn evaluation committee consisted of representatives from: Columbus City Council; Department of Finance and Management; Assistant Director, Mayor’s Office; Deputy Director, Department of Public Safety; Director, Department of Technology; Chief Counsel, City Attorney’s Office; Deputy Chief, Division of Police and President, NAACP.  Of the six (6) vendors that submitted proposals, three (3) were selected for presentations.  After further evaluations and scoring, two (2) vendors were selected for field testing.  The Division of Police provided approximately thirty police officers to participate in a pilot program to test all provided equipment. Likewise, the Evidence Management System was evaluated by the City Prosecutor's Office, the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, and the Division of Police Record’s Unit.  After presentation from both the pilot program and evidence management systems, the committee presented its rankings to the Finance and Management Director. The Finance and Management Director instructed the committee to proceed with negotiations with Axon Enterprise, Inc.  The results of the negotiation were successful. This ordinance is contingent on the passage of ordinance 0457-2022, prepared by the Finance and Management Department establishing an option contract (UTC) with this company.\nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested as funds are needed immediately to equip police officers with new state of the art cameras that will replace outdated technology.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $905,568.00 from the General Permanent Improvement Fund and $6,500,000.00 from the General Fund ($4,000,000 of which is already reserved on ACPR002109) for the purchase of body worn cameras, in-car cameras, interview room cameras and all needed accessories for the Division of Police from the Universal Term Contract established by the Department of Finance and Management with Axon Enterprise, Inc. This ordinance also amends the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget (CIB) and appropriates and transfers funds between projects within the General Permanent Improvement Fund and transfers funds between Object Classes within the Division of Police General Fund for this contract.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds within the General Permanent Improvement Fund and the transfer of funds within the General Fund; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to associate all general budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement for the purchase of body worn cameras, in-car cameras, interview room cameras and accessories for the Division of Police; to authorize the expenditure of $905,568.00 from the General Permanent Improvement Fund and $6,500,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
