    "description": "Title\nRecognizing the Baptist Pastors Conference of Columbus & Vicinity dedication to spiritual edification to the residents of Columbus, and celebrating the 70th Annual Citywide Simultaneous Holy Convocation & Revival\n \nBody\nWHEREAS The Baptist Pastors Conference came into existence when Pastors from various churches in the City of Columbus and surrounding areas concluded that there was a need for a organization solely for Pastors to deal with many of the adverse problems facing many Pastors in assisting their members to better deal with Social, Economic and Educational issues; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Baptist Pastors Conference was organized with Dr. L.H. Johnson, who served as its first president; and\n \nWHEREAS, President L. H. Johnson while pastoring at Mount Olive Baptist Church and Pastor Sandy Ray who was pastoring at Shiloh Baptist Church discovered that they both were having a revival the same week, so they decided to have preaching in the day at the same place. Sometime later Pastor Phale D. Hale who have been to Kansas City and witnessed a Simultaneous Revival, brought that idea to President L. H. Johnson who presented it to the Conference and thus the birth of the Simultaneous Revival in 1951; and \n \nWHEREAS, The legacy of the Revival has received National Notoriety because of the unity within the City and among the churches. This Holy Convocational event is historically held fourteen days before Easter; now therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: Recognizing the Baptist Pastors Conference of Columbus & Vicinity dedication to spiritual edification to the   residents of Columbus, and celebrating the 70th Annual Citywide Simultaneous Holy Convocation & Revival.",
