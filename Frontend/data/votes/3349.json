    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Cindy Kennedy, Assistant Director of Real Estate - Operations, requester and agent for The Ohio State University, to sell an approximate 0.373 acre portion of the Hughes Street area right-of-way.  This portion of right-of-way is described as a 0.373 acre portion with Phale D. Hale Drive abutting at the north, Hawthorne Avenue abutting at the south, PID 010-067001 abutting at the east, and PID 010-297715 abutting at the west.  The Ohio State University is already the current owner of the abutting parcels at the east and west.\n \nThe sale of this right-of-way will bring together the two separate parcels to the east and west of this portion of the right-of-way that is already owned by The Ohio State University.  This will allow a more fluid use of the mentioned parcels now and for future development.\n \nThe Department of Public Service has agreed to sell the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, (EXHIBIT A and EXHIBIT B) and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  Per current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $20,309.85 was established.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on January 21, 2021.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to The Ohio State University, at the cost of $20,309.85.\n \n2.
