    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with CTL Engineering Inc. for construction management services for the Alum Creek Trail - Johnstown Road East Side Connector Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $56,400.00.\n \nIn 2014, the Department was awarded federal grant funding from MORPC, administered by the Ohio Department of Transportation (PID 99828), for construction funds to improve safety and access to the Alum Creek Trail for the East Columbus and Krumm Park Communities.  The project will build a trail from the Alum Creek Trail near Ohio Dominican University to Johnstown Road and Cassady Avenue.   The one mile project also includes walking and biking improvements along Johnstown Road and 10th Avenue, connecting to Krumm Park and William Adams Community Center.  \nThe project includes separated trail, bike lanes, modifications to an existing trail bridge, and safety improvements for the neighborhood to connect to the regional trail.  The East Columbus neighborhood is bounded by 5th Avenue to I-670 and Stelzer Road to Alum Creek.  Over 4,000 residents and employees will be within a 10 minute walk from this project. The connector opens up access to over 126 miles of regional trail network.  A future section of this project will extend the bike lanes along Johnstown Road to downtown Gahanna.\nBy modifying this contract, CTL Engineering Inc. will be authorized to continue to provide construction management and inspection services for the remainder of the Alum Creek Trail - Johnstown Road East Side Connector construction project. The construction project experienced a significant, unexpected delay, thus causing a need for a time extension for both construction and construction management and inspection services.  This modification covers the management and inspection services.  Another modification for construction will be forthcoming.  \n \nCTL Engineering Inc. would perform the services most efficiently and effectively since they have been on it from the start. Additionally, it would not be in the best interest of Recreation and Parks to not have a gap in construction management and inspection services, which would be the case if the Department were to award the remainder of the work through another procurement process. The cost for this modification was determined by estimating remaining effort hours (based on historical hours spent during previous months of work on the contract) multiplied by established hourly rates.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCTL Engineering Inc., Inc.\n2860 Fisher Road, Columbus, OH 43204                                                 \nHassan Y. Zahran, PE (614) 276-8123                 \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004209, 31-0680767\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: June 4, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as construction work is currently taking place and the department does not want a delay in providing construction management and inspection services for the construction work.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year round benefits to urban lifestyles. Access to trails and to key destinations is one of the top rated active transportation priorities noted by Columbus residents. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The department conducted extensive public involvement during plan development with neighborhood public open houses, letters of support from the community, collaboration with the City of Gahanna, and social media feedback from trail users around the region.\n \nArea(s) Affected: East Columbus (50) - All Columbus and regional trail users will benefit from these improvements\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides safe connections to the regional trail network for nearby neighborhoods. The project will provide an overall safer trail and access to active mode of transportation for the nearby community.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $284,887.00 was legislated for the Alum Creek Trail - Johnstown Road East Side Connector construction management contract by Ordinance 0918-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $56,400.00. $56,400.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $341,287.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with CTL Engineering Inc. for the Alum Creek Trail - Johnstown Road East Side Connector Project; to authorize the transfer of $56,400.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $56,400.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
