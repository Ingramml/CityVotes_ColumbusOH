    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.                     BACKGROUND:  The existing SMOC Inventory Control has around 16 separate store rooms located throughout the Fairwood Facility. Consolidating these store rooms into one secure location is a priority in order to properly secure, control, and maintain the facility inventory. This renewal is needed for detailed design to ensure that construction drawings and specifications are developed in accordance with City requirements.\nThe first contract provided a space needs study and alternatives analysis.  Renewal 1 is for detailed design and support during bidding.  There will be a future renewal for services during construction.\n  \nRenewal Information:     \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:   $544,534.67\nOriginal Contract (PO243618)                     $177,903.42\nRenewal No. 1 (Current)                     $544,534.67\nRenewal No. 2 (Future)                     $365,200.00\nCURRENT PROPOSED TOTAL                     $1,087,638.09\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen.\nThis renewal was anticipated\n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nIf this phase of the project were to be bid out it would result in inefficiencies and added fees, while attempting to bring a new consultant up to speed on the design.  The design team that performed the other phase of design has key technical knowledge regarding the design intent which is required for detailed design of the improvements.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nA scope of services, consistent with the original proposal and contract, was developed and fee was negotiated between the City and consultant.\n \n2.                     PROJECT TIMELINE: Renewal No. 1 will fund detailed design services through 2023.\n \n3.                     EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time\n \n4.                     CONTRACT COMPIANCE NO: 31-1319961 | MBE | 11/30/2024 | Vendor # 005053\n \n5.   ECONOMIC IMPACT: This project will protect DPU inventory staff and assets from the elements, simplify crew load out activities, and centralize stock in one area of SMOC. This will help when trying to locate key equipment for field crews. This project is advancing in coordination with CIP 650505-100000.\n \n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT: There is sufficient funding within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligations Fund (6109) for this project, however an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget will be necessary to align sufficient authority for this project. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with Dynotec Inc. for the SMOC Inventory Control Consolidation Project; to expend up to $544,534.67 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligations Fund 6109; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.
