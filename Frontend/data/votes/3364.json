    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio to pilot an income support program to promote access to strong career pathways for underemployed individuals.\n \nFor the underemployed residents of Columbus, one of the most significant barriers to workforce development is that it is unaffordable to stop work to participate in training. Living paycheck to paycheck makes a mid-term training program impossible. Many people find themselves trapped in low-wage jobs without the time, resources, or savings to earn a credential that would set them in a higher-paying job with a clear career path.\n \nOffering a temporary income replacement for underemployed individuals to participate in mid-term (10-20 week) training opportunities may be a way to break this cycle. The pilot program proposed by the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio will provide wages to a small group of training participants to focus fully on earning a credential and/or developing new skills.\n \nThe mission of the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio is to partner with area businesses and organizations on workforce needs so that people are fully employed at their ability and potential in the thriving Central Ohio economy. The Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio has the connections, staff, and resources necessary to walk with participants through this pilot program and set them up for success.\n \nTraining partners for this pilot program include Color Coded Labs and Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Color Coded Labs hosts a 16-week tech and coding boot camp. Employers in their network are hiring at a rapid pace and are prioritizing diversity. Nationwide Children’s Hospital participants will earn credentials to qualify for Patient Care Assistant and Patient Access Assistant positions. Nationwide is committed to the upskilling and career growth of these employees.\n \nThe pilot program is expected to serve 15-20 individuals in 2022, with plans to scale up in 2023. Program evaluation will be performed in collaboration with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio and is essential to assessing the value of this approach to solving the underemployment issue and to improving the program in the future.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio in support of their income support pilot program; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund. ($200,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio has a vast network of partner employers and access to essential resources for workforce development for underemployed Central Ohio residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, over a third of Columbus residents live at under 200% of the federal poverty level and frequently lack access to workforce development opportunities; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio is prepared to pilot a program to provide income support to those pursuing new skills and credentials; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Clerk's Office to authorize a grant agreement with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio in support of their income support pilot program; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Workforce Development Board of Central Ohio in support of their income support pilot program.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $200,000.00 in the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015, to the City Clerk per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $200,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1 of this ordinance, is hereby authorized in the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
