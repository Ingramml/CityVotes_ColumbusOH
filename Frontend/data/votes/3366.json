    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify non-profit service agreements with Dress for Success Columbus and United Way of Central Ohio for the provision of services for a twelve-month period that begins on or after January 1, 2022.  These agreements were first awarded in 2019, renewed in 2020, modified in 2021, and will be modified in 2022 in an amount up to $134,000.00 ($80,000.00 for Dress for Success and $54,000.00 for United Way).\n \nIn 2018, a request for proposals (RFP) was issued via direct email to agencies (and City partners to send to their networks of agencies), by press release, and posting on the City’s website.   The City received 142 proposals representing 101 agencies with over $19 million in requests.  Of those, 44 programs were selected for funding in 2019 and agreements were authorized under ordinance 1170-2019.  These agreements were renewed in 2020 under the authority of ordinance 0571-2020.\n \nHistorically, the department has done a RFP effort every two years and under normal circumstances such an effort would have been in late 2020 for 2021.  Due to COVID-19 and its impact on the nonprofit sector and department priorities, the department had elected to extend these agreements in FY 2021 through an agreement modification, authorized by ordinance 0388-2021. Due to similar COVID-19 related circumstances in 2021, the department is electing to extend these agreements for FY 2022 through an agreement modification.\n \nThis ordinance includes authorization for two programs with authorization for the remaining programs being submitted as two separate ordinances.\n \nIt is the department’s intent to “modify” these agreements, which means executing the modification before the prior agreement has expired.  Should circumstances prevent that, the agreements will be processed as an “original” agreement with the same scope of services as the original agreement in 2019 and up to the amount of this ordinance.\n \nCurrently, it is the department’s intent to do a RFP process in late 2022 for FY 2023 non-profit service agreements.\n \nThe agreements will be modified pending availability of funds and program performance per the agreements with the agencies.  The programs have performed in accordance with the agreements and are approved for a fourth year of funding. \n \nThese programs and initiatives will provide services to residents of Columbus within one or more of the City’s Five Investment Strategies: \n•                     Income through Employment\n•                     Job Quality\n•                     Education and Training\n•                     Financial Capability\n•                     Stabilization and Resource Support\n \nEmergency action is necessary to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this agreement is available in the Administration Division’s 2022 General Fund budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: Dress for Success Columbus’ vendor number is 001406 and expires 12/7/2022 and United Way of Central Ohio vendor number is 006101 and expires 3/13/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify non-profit service agreements with Dress for Success Columbus in an amount up to $80,000.00 and United Way of Central Ohio in an amount up to $54,000.00; to authorize the expenditure of up to $134,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($134,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2018 the City received 142 proposals representing 101 agencies with over $19 million in requests; and\n \nWHEREAS,  44 programs were selected for up to 2 years of funding through the City’s competitive funding process and its Human Services Grant Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, due to COVID-19, the department has elected to modify the agreements for FY2021 and FY2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, all 44 programs have been approved for a fourth year of funding with 2 programs authorized under this ordinance and the remainder under two separate ordinances; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to modify the agreement with Dress for Success and United Way for a 12 month period, which will begin on or after January 1, 2022, for the continued provision of social services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is the department’s intent to “modify” this agreement, which means executing the modification before the prior agreement has expired.  Should circumstances prevent that the agreement, the agreement will be processed as an “original” agreement with the same scope of services as the original agreement in 2019 and the amounts listed in this ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, these programs include, but are not limited to, youth services, resettlement programs, housing referral, intervention activities, information and referral efforts, community mediation, resource centers and neighborhood activities; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify these non-profit service agreements with Dress for Success Columbus and United Way of Central Ohio to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of vital program services, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify non-profit service agreements with Dress for Success Columbus, in an amount up to $80,000.00, and United Way of Central Ohio, in an amount up to $54,000.00, for a twelve (12) month period that begins on or after January 1, 2022.  If circumstances prevent the Director from modifying the agreement, the Director is authorized to execute an original agreement for a twelve (12) month period that begins on or after January 1, 2022, and up to $80,000.00 for Dress for Success and $54,000.00 for United Way.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That the expenditure of $134,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-01 (Administration), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.                     Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.                       That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
