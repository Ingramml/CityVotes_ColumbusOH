    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a non-profit service agreement with Alvis, Inc. for $250,000.00 for a twelve-month period effective as of January 1, 2022.  This agreement is in support of the Help in Reentry Employment education program.\n \nThe Alvis Help in Reentry Employment (HIRE) education program serves adults returning to Columbus following release from a correctional facility (local, state, federal), or are under correctional supervision. Individuals reentering the community disproportionately experience poverty. All report incomes below $5,000, 33% have no job experience, and 43% do not have a high school education. HIRE participants engage in five days of job readiness training covering employment goals and career paths, to resumes, cultural diversity, and employer expectations. They are then eligible to earn industry-recognized certifications to boost employability and advancement. GED classes are available for those who have not yet earned a high school diploma. Placement assistance is offered in partnership with the Alvis network of area employers. Wraparound services supported by other resources include case management, financial literacy, substance use disorder treatment/recovery, and cognitive behavioral therapy. HIRE can be the difference between moving out of poverty and a downward spiral to recidivism.\n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of HIRE program services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the General Fund’s Reimagine Safety Subfund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 004275 and expires 12/15/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a non-profit service agreement with Alvis, Inc., in an amount up to $250,000.00, for a twelve (12) month period effective as of January 1, 2022; to authorize an appropriation within the Reimagine Safety subfund; to authorize a transfer, appropriation, and expenditure within the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
