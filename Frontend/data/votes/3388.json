    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract for the purchase of the Milo Range Theater 180 Multi-Screen Training Simulator Suite from FAAC Incorporated in the amount of $76,495.00. The Division of Police needs to purchase the new simulator because the current simulator requires ongoing maintenance and is out of date in regards to scenarios.  This new range will be used to provide sworn personnel with advanced police tactical training and recruits with entry level tactical training. The simulator is also used to educate civilians through family nights, the Citizen Police Academy, media engagement, and recruiting seminars. The simulator will increase trainee’s knowledge, skills, and confidence in a safe, challenging environment that is highly interactive and engaging. The Course Designer Program is an editing software program that can be used to create lessons, tests, and presentations for classrooms, auditoriums, and training rooms or for one on one instruction. Training is streamlined and more efficient by using this simulator.  One instructor is able to get personnel through three to four scenarios in less than fifteen minutes in contrast to live simulations that would take three to four instructors to run safely and each scenario takes five to ten minutes depending on the scenario.  This simulator also helps instruct and correct trainee issues such as OPOTA qualification courses for firearms.  This simulator allows officers/recruits to run through the course without using live rounds, which saves thousands of dollars. Another large benefit of the simulator is the ability to pause and playback the scenario to teach the trainee about shot placement, reaction time, and environmental awareness.  They are also able to show where there were warning signs of what the suspect might be doing that cannot necessarily be replayed in a live scenario.  In 2022 the Training Academy has been tasked with training three recruit classes instead of two and approximately fifty lateral transfers as well.  This simulator will help to streamline training these 220 recruits and officers.  The funding for this simulator has already been approved and is appropriated on ACPR002108.\n \nBid Information:   Informal bids were solicited due to time constraints and the lead time to get the system in place.  The Division of Police currently has one class in the academy and three more classes starting this year in June, September and December.  Lateral transfers of Police Officers will also take place anytime soon.  The Division needs to have a simulator that works well and provides all the necessary training tools to prepare our recruits and sworn personnel to do their jobs with excellence.  The ACPR has an end date of 9-30-2022; therefore, the Division of Police is requesting a formal Bid Waiver in accordance with Chapter 329 of the City Code\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nContract Compliance Number: 382690218, vendor will be contract compliant by the time the legislation is read.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency legislation is requested in order to complete this purchase as soon as possible to properly train our recruit classes, sworn, lateral transfers, and civilians and to not lose the funding that was appropriated for the simulator. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This ordinance authorizes the purchase of the Milo Range Theater 180 Multi-Screen Training Simulator Suite from FAAC Incorporated in the amount of $76,495.00 from the Seizure Fund for the Division of Police. Funds were budgeted and appropriated in the Drug Seizure Fund for this purchase during FY 2021.  There is no impact on the General Fund due to this purchase. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Public Safety, to enter into a contract with FAAC Incorporated for the purchase of the Milo Range Theater 180 Multi-Screen Training Simulator Suite for the Division of Police; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329; to authorize the expenditure of $76,495.00 from the Seizure Fund; and to declare an emergency.
