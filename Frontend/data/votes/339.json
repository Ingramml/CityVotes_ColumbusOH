    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the issuance of a refund for the unexpended balance of funds deposited by IKE Smart City, LLC with the City to support the completion of the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2 project, part of a multi-phase effort culminating in various public infrastructure improvements to North High Street and adjacent streets.  It also authorizes the refund of unexpended funds deposited by IKE Smart City, LLC with the City to support the completion of other phases of the  Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements project if final accounting should determine a refund is required.\n \nIKE Smart City, LLC (“IKE”) desired to install interactive kiosks, described as “a breakthrough citizen engagement platform that helps cities, business improvement districts and destination marketing organizations communicate with the public, encouraging a pedestrian-oriented environment, and tells the story of their city”, within the Short North Area, near the Convention Center, and at other locations in downtown Columbus. \n \nThe City, acting through the Department of Public Service, agreed to install, or to cause the installation of, that equipment as part of the Short North SID - High Street Improvements project, including up to 7 kiosks during the completion of Phase 2. \n \nOrdinance 1952-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to execute a reimbursement agreement, effective March 27, 2019, with IKE, pursuant to which IKE deposited $510,000.00 with the City to support the performance of construction and inspection services necessary to the installation and successful operation of the kiosks. Those funds were based upon estimates provided by the Department of Public Service to IKE and were allocated as follows:\n•                     Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2: $325,000.00\n•                     Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 3: $65,000.00\n•                     NCR - Weinland Park (7th to 9th): $120,000.00\n \nThe reimbursement agreement with IKE stated final accounting would be performed upon completion of each phase of the project to determine if IKE owed additional funds for the work performed in that phase or if IKE was owed a refund because the amount deposited exceeded the amount used.  The Department of Public Service recently performed final accounting relative to the completion of the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2 project and determined IKE is owed a refund in the amount of $140,658.34.  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of that sum to enable the Department of Public Service to issue the requisite refund to IKE. \n \nThis ordinance also seeks to authorize the issuance of any additional refunds that may be owed to IKE relative to the remaining phases of the Short North SID - High Street Improvements project and authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of additional funds and the establishment of additional auditor certificates to support the same.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $140,658.34 is available in Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Improvements (Non-Bond) Fund, Project P530053-100002 (Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2) to satisfy the obligation currently owed to IKE.  The appropriation of funds within the Street and Highway Improvements (Non-Bond) is necessary for this expenditure and any related future expenditures.  \n \n3.  EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to facilitate the return of unused project funding to IKE as soon as reasonably practicable. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation of $510,000.00 in the Street and Highway Improvements Non-Bond; to authorize the Director of Public Service to refund to IKE Smart City, LLC the sum of $140,658.34, which represents the unexpended balance of monies previously deposited by IKE Smart City, LLC to support the completion of the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID - High Street Improvements Phase 2 project; to authorize the expenditure of $140,658.34 for that purpose; to authorize the Director of Public Service to refund the unspent balance, if any, of funding previously deposited by IKE Smart City LLC to support work performed during subsequent phases of the Short North SID - High Street Improvements project; to authorize the City Auditor to establish additional auditor certificates as needed at the request of the Director of Public Service without additional legislation; and to declare an emergency.
