    "description": "Explanation\n \nSuccess by Third Grade ensures that children have the supports needed to achieve third grade reading proficiency. Research confirms that third graders who are unable to read at grade level are among the most vulnerable to dropping out of school before graduating. Students not proficient in reading by the end of third grade were four times more likely to drop out of high school, and 88% of students who failed to earn a high school diploma had struggled to achieve third grade reading proficiency.\n \nSuccess by Third Grade uses a collective impact approach, centered on parents, caregivers and students who are most in need of supports. United Way of Central Ohio has been asked by community and school district leaders to be the backbone agency to shepherd the work. Their role includes working with participants to identify gaps in service, understand potential solutions, and align and support needed programs and services. In addition to serving as a bridge between community and schools, United Way will tap into the core skills of communicating the issues and work to their network, rallying community support, bringing in resources, collecting and analyzing data, and improving the trajectory of young learners.\n \nFunding will support the staffing and expenses necessary to coordinate and align a community wide undertaking of this magnitude.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Recovery Fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of the Office of Education, on behalf of the office of the Mayor, to enter into a grant agreement with United Way of Central Ohio to implement Success by Third Grade; and to authorize an expenditure within the Recovery Fund.
