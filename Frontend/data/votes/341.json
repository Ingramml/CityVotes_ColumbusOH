    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $400,000.00 and the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the University District Special Improvement District in an amount up to $400,000.00.\n \nChapter 1710 of the Ohio Revised Code, effective September 29, 1994, provides for the creation of Special Improvement Districts, by non-profit corporations governed by trustees elected by the property owners for the provision of special services in a designated district. \n \nIn 2015 a petition to create a new SID in the University area to be known as the University District Special Improvement District (SID) was approved by Council. The property owners initiated a petition process in which the owners of at least 75% of the area of all real property located within the District signed, acknowledging that they are interested in the creation of a Special Improvement District and they approve of the Plan for Improvements and Services to be provided by the University District SID. This petition was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council by Ordinance 0641-2015, passed March 23, 2015. \n \nAnother action required by the Ohio Revised Code is the approval of the Plan for Improvements and Services in said plan. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0061X-2015, passed March 23, 2015. \n \nThe third piece of legislation was to declare the necessity to implement the Plan of Services adopted by the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and to levy a special assessment for the services. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0096-2015, passed April 27, 2015. \n \nA final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 1892-2015, passed July 27, 2015. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the District Plan.\n \nThis legislation disburses assessments to be collected in fiscal year 2021 to be returned to the SID. \n \nEmergency action is requested to continue services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments to be collected from property owners in the University District Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from University SID Fund (fund 3311).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s vendor number is 016992 and is valid until 2/6/22.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $400,000.00 from the University SID fund; authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the University District Special Improvement District in an amount up to $400,000.00; and to declare an emergency. ($400,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council approved the creation and implementation of a plan for services for the University District Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for a period of 5 years from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council has also levied assessments in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 1710 for such purposes, which funds are in the process of collection and are required by law to be distributed to the District by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the assessment funds collected by the County and forwarded to the City for disbursement will be available in March and September 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development, Economic Development Division, in that it is immediately necessary to appropriate and expend said funds to allow for continuation of services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
