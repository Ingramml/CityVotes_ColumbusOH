The Society now has the opportunity to receive donations of two important collections of historical artifacts and artwork that will significantly further its mission in the community and make Columbus and the Society a major research destination.  This will bring visitors and related tourism to Columbus.\n \nOne collection’s focus is on Abraham Lincoln and his ties to Columbus and Ohio.  It includes over 900 books and over 1,000 original letters, documents, speeches, maps, etc.  This is a major opportunity for the citizens of Columbus. It will be used in research, publications, and a variety of adult and child educational programs. Funding will be used to inventory and archive this important collection.\n \nThe other collection is coming through Columbus Sister Cities International and Columbus’ sister city of Genoa, Italy.  It is a collection of 19 original sculptures and 40 original drawings of the noted Italian sculptor, Edoardo Alfieri.  CHS will host an exhibition of the collection and make it available for research and educational programming.  Funding will be used for the exhibition and archival storage.\n \nThe entire Central Ohio Community will benefit from the addition of these collections.  They will result in increased attendance at the Society’s exhibitions as well as increased tourism from out-of-town visitors.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide CHS with resources in advance of the exhibits’ opening, currently scheduled for late April.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Historical Society to support the installation of new exhibits; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
