($371,367.10)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a contract with OARnet/OSU, a non-profit organization, for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support services.  The original agreement (EL011737) was authorized by ordinance 1716-2010, passed December 13, 2010.  The agreement was most recently renewed by authority of ordinance 0826-2021, passed by Columbus City Council on April 19, 2021, establishing purchase order PO270714.  The total cost associated with this ordinance is $371,367.10 for the coverage term period from April 2, 2022 to April 1, 2023.\n \nThrough the State of Ohio Virtualization Program, authorized for the city’s use by Ordinance No. 582-87, for VMware software licensing renewal, OARnet offers significant discounts on VMWare that are not available in the market place, so it is in the City’s best interests to procure VMWare through OARnet, instead of through another procurement process.  The pricing offered to the City reflects the agreed upon public sector discounts available to all participants in the State of Ohio Virtualization Program. The policy for anyone renewing software purchased under the Ohio State University VMware contract can only be renewed through OARnet. (See attached OARnet letter).\n \nServer virtualization is the conversion of one physical server into multiple individual and isolated virtual storage spaces. This industry standard was adopted by the Department of Technology in 2009 to reduce the costs of Data Center operations. This also reduces power consumption, cooling requirements, and provides further capabilities for recovery and availability of information systems. VMWare software is the core component that is needed in order to operate virtual servers that run critical applications for the enterprise such as Accela, CUBS, and 311. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nIn 2020 and 2021, the Department of Technology legislated with OARnet/OSU, $77,164.10 and $370,143.69, respectively for VMware software licenses, maintenance fees, and associated services. This 2022 ordinance for $371,367.10 is to cover the cost associated with VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support services through April 1, 2023. Funds to cover these costs are budgeted and available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:                      \nVendor name: OARnet/OSU, 1224 Kinnear Rd Ste. 130, Columbus, OH 43212;  CC#/FID#: 31-6025986 (105);  (DAX Vendor Acct. #: 005303);     Expiration Date: Non-Profit Organization (NPO)     \n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a contract with OARnet/OSU for existing VMWare software licensing, maintenance and support services; and to authorize the expenditure of $371,367.10 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.
