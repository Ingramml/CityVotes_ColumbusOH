    "description": ".Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide funding to the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to support the completion of various future public improvement projects administered by Franklin County. \nThe Department of Public Service and the Franklin County Engineer’s Office have a long-standing collaborative relationship when transportation related capital improvements span both jurisdictions.  Recently, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office proposed undertaking a series of smaller projects encompassing road maintenance and rehabilitation and other planned improvements adjacent to portions of the Columbus transportation network.  As is customary, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office asked if the Department of Public Service planned upcoming projects in these areas to determine it would be economically beneficial to the City to combine projects in an area with Franklin County and do the work as one project instead of separate projects.  The Department of Public Service agreed it was more economical and efficient to improve portions of the Columbus transportation network adjacent to the proposed Franklin County improvements while Franklin County completes those improvements.  In these instances, one of the parties initiates and manages the capital improvement project and related contracts for the work within both jurisdictions, while the other party contributes funding for the part of the project that lies within its jurisdiction.  It was decided Franklin County would manage and hold the contracts for the proposed projects, as the majority of the work would be performed in its jurisdiction.  The Department of Public Service is to reimburse Franklin County for the portion of work performed within the City of Columbus.\nIt is necessary to execute a reimbursement agreement, and any amendments or modifications thereto, between the Department of Public Service and the Franklin County Engineer’s Office, for these projects, and to encumber and expend funds to reimburse Franklin County for the work.  Funding in the amount of $250,000.00 will be appropriated for this purpose.  \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $250,000.00 are available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704.  The funds are appropriated.  A budget amendment is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.\n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to satisfy its financial commitment as soon as reasonably practicable so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of planned improvements.  \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide funding to the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to support the completion of public improvement projects administered by Franklin County within the City's jurisdiction; to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for this project; and to declare an emergency.
