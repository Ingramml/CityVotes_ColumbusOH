    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $375,000.00 and the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Morse Road SID in an amount up to $375,000.00.\n \nIn 2005 the Northland Alliance, the Morse Road SID Exploratory Committee, and the City of Columbus Development Department initiated an effort with property owners on Morse Road from Indianola Avenue to Cleveland Avenue to create a Special Improvement District (SID). This creation required multiple pieces of legislation.\n \nIn 2006, the Morse Road SID was created for a term of ten (10) years. On March 14, 2016, a petition to reauthorize for another ten (10) years was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council by Ordinance No. 0611- 2016.  \n \nIn 2016, Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0043X-2016, as required by the Ohio Revised Code, to approve of the Plan of Improvements and Services and the inclusion of City owned property in said plan. \n \nA third piece of legislation was passed to declare the necessity to implement the Plan of Services adopted by the Morse Road Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and to levy a special assessment for the services. This legislation was approved by Columbus City Council by Resolution No. 0098X-2016, passed May 2, 2016. \n \nThe final piece of legislation, providing for the levy of assessment to property owners, was approved by City Council by Ordinance No. 1579-2016, passed June 20, 2016. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the District Plan.\n \nThis legislation disburses assessments to be collected in fiscal year 2021 to be returned to the SID. \n \nEmergency action is requested to continue services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments collected from property owners in the Morse Road Special Improvement District in 2021. These funds are deposited into and expended from Agency Fund 3309.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s vendor number is 001483 and is valid from 1/9/20-1/9/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $375,000.00 from Agency Fund 3309; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Morse Road Special Improvement District in an amount up to $375,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
