    "title": "To establish a new authorized strength ordinance for various divisions in the City of Columbus to be consistent with the adopted 2022 budget; to repeal ordinance 0143-2022; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance amends the current authorized strength, as set forth in ordinance 0143-2022.\n \nThe strength levels for most general fund agencies are set to be equal to the 2022 budget as amended by City Council (including the Departments of Health and Recreation and Parks).  Authorized strength levels of smaller non-general fund agencies are set to be equal to the adopted 2022 budget as amended, while the strength levels of certain larger non-general fund agencies may have their strength set slightly higher to allow for flexibility in hiring.  \n \nThree full-time general fund positions are requested in the Public Safety Director’s Office to expand Group Violence Intervention initiatives.  The Department of Finance and Management requests to add one part-time general fund position in the Division of Financial Management.  In the Department of Development, the Housing Division will add three full-time grant funded positions.  The Department of Recreation and Parks will transition 14 part-time positions into 7 full-time positions, add an additional 5 full-time positions to support the Design and Construction team, and add 1 new Management Analyst position, all within their primary operating fund.\n \nThe Department of Public Service requests three additional full-time non-general fund positions in the Administration Division to allow for flexibility in staffing.  Three other full-time non-general fund positions will be added (2 in the Division of Design and Construction, and 1 in Traffic Management) to account for cross-departmentally budgeted positions accounted for in the 2022 operating budget.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds for these strength levels are budgeted and/or the positions will not be filled until revenues have been clearly identified and appropriated.  In all cases, the ability to hire will be monitored by the Division of Finance and Management.  As such, there is no fiscal impact associated with passage of this ordinance.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the filling of budgeted vacant positions in certain departments in order to assure the immediate preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo establish a new authorized strength ordinance for various divisions in the City of Columbus to be consistent with the adopted 2022 budget; to repeal ordinance 0143-2022; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Mayor's Executive 2022 budget was submitted to City Council on November 15, 2021 for consideration; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council adopted said budget on February 7, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance repeals authorized strength ordinance 0143-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to establish a new authorized strength ordinance to provide for the efficient operation of the city, and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That pursuant to Section 14 of the City Charter, the maximum number of officers and employees authorized to be employed within the various Departments, Boards and Offices of the City is hereby fixed and established as follows: \n \n-1- Refer to attachment ORD0788-2022currentstrength.xlsx\n-2- Refer to attachment ORD0788-2022previousstrength.xlsx\n \nThe foregoing positions authorized include all positions within each department, division, board, office or commission, whether appointed or elected except the members of any board or commission authorized by charter or ordinance.
