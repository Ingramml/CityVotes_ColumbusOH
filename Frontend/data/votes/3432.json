    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe City Auditor originally entered into a Professional Services Agreement with Tyler Technologies, Inc., for the Purchase and Installation, Maintenance, and Support of the City Financial Management System. The contract was authorized by Ordinance No. 1077-2013 and passed by the Columbus City Council on May 20, 2013. The most recent contract modification was authorized by Ordinance No. 2373-2021 and passed by Columbus City Council 10/13/2021.  \nUnder Ordinance 2373-2021, the City completed its upgrade from DAX2012 to D365 and discontinued our use of Tyler Forms and Tyler Cashiering.  The City Auditor is continuing use of Tyler ACFR Statement Builder on a yearly subscription basis. Tyler also licensed the intellectual property (balances export from D365, changes with code) to City on an AS-IS basis. This City is able to use the export and change it as D365 changes without going back to Tyler. 2022 is the first complete year contracting with Tyler for ACFR Statement Builder as a standalone product without any other services or products (Tyler Insight Extensions, hosting, other Tyler products, export rework). Pricing was negotiated with Tyler for just this product and after extracting costs for discontinued products and services. The City Auditor used reasonable measures to review other potential ACFR solutions. This product is a highly specialized statement builder for creating governmental financial statements in the Annual Comprehensive Financial report.  Moving to another product is extensive to recreate the export and will require funding a project to implement. The cost of implementing this change will likely to be much greater than the current subscription cost and needs to be timed with future reporting periods. Currently, it is in the City’s best interest to continue with Tyler ACFR builder for continuity of statements as the City Auditor explores other alternatives for future years.\nThis legislation authorizes the City Auditor to modify and extend the contract authorized by Ordinance no. 2327-2021 for one year and provides funding for Tyler ACFR Statement Builder. ACFR Statement Builder is a yearly subscription based software as a service. \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue services for Tyler ACFR Statement Builder, without interruption. \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Info Services Operating fund, Dept of Technology Operating subfund.    \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 010121 and expires 03/21/2024.\n \n Title\nTo authorize the City Auditor to modify the existing contract with Tyler Technologies, Inc. and provide funding for the Tyler ACFR Statement Builder; to authorize the expenditure of up to $18,849.00, from the Department of Technology operating fund for a total expenditure of $18,849.00; and to declare an emergency ($18,849.00). \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the City Auditor to modify the contract with Tyler Technologies, Inc. to continue yearly Tyler ACFR Statement Builder services for the City of Columbus necessary for 2022 operations and reporting requirements; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $18,849.00; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Auditor’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to modify an existing contract and authorize additional  Tyler ACFR Statement Builder services,in order to continue services for Tyler ACFR Statement Builder without interruption,  thereby preserving the public health, peace, safety, and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with Tyler Technologies Inc. for yearly Tyler ACFR Statement Builder services for the City of Columbus.  \nSECTION 2. That the sum of $18,849.00 is hereby authorized to be expended from Fund 5100 and subfund 510001 Dept./Div 47-02, Object Class 03, main account 63945, program IT005. (Sheets attached)\n \nSECTION 3. That the sum of $18,849.00 is for Tyler ACFR Statement Builder services for 2022.\n  \nSECTION  4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby authorized for expenditure and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION  5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding contract or contract associated with the expenditure of the funds. \n \nSECTION  6. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this resolution is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
