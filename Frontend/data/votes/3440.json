    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven (DBA GPD Group) for professional services for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Connector Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $102,876.04.\n \nThis contract modification is necessary to complete the final plans for the trail project. Plans include a new pedestrian bridge, floodwall modifications, a neighborhood connection to the Franklinton Community, and a trail along Souder Avenue, extending from West Broad Street to the regional Scioto Trail at Dublin Road.  The Department was awarded a grant for 3.1 million dollars from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission in 2016 to assist towards construction of the project. \n \nThe modification is for additional engineering services required to relocate electric poles along Souder Avenue, realignment of a segment of the path to avoid railroad coordination, completion of a federal floodplain permit for the pedestrian bridge, and unforeseen right of way plan revisions due to recent private property improvements along a section of Souder Avenue.  This modification will enable the Recreation and Parks Department to complete the project on schedule, a requirement of the grant funding. It is not practical to procure the additional services from another vendor since GPD Group has been the design professional associated with this project all along and these efforts impact the final design that GPD Group is producing.  The cost was determined by established hourly rates and negotiated effort hours remaining to complete the scope of work by the project team.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven (DBA GPD Group)\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                     \nKevin Grathwol, 614-210-0751\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006560, 34-1134715\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 20, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the final plans can be completed by the end of the year as grant funding awarded for this project requires that the project be ready to construct in January 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The Souder Avenue Bridge is a heavily used bike and pedestrian route with regional trails on both banks of the Scioto River. The two lane bridge is recognized widely as one of the city’s most unsafe and narrow crossings. Manual trail counts were conducted in July 2016 and found that the average daily use of the Souder Avenue Bridge was approximately 250 uses per day. This equates to approximately 90,000 uses annually. These numbers place the Souder Avenue Bridge Connection near the top five busiest sections in the Columbus trail system. The Broad Street and Souder Avenue corridor is also experiencing major redevelopment. The neighborhood strongly supports increased safety and access to the regional trail system as it supports access to jobs, parks, and downtown. The project will design a new separated bridge to accommodate cyclists, runners, and walkers as part of an overall Franklinton Loop trail network to connect people to and from an underserved community.   \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Department conducted extensive outreach involving public and private stakeholders in the Franklinton community. These included City of Columbus Economic Development, Planning, Public Service, and Health Departments. Private developers, including Mount Carmel and Cover My Meds were engaged. Franklinton Development Association, Franklinton Trade Association, Franklinton Civic Association, YAY Bikes, and Experience Columbus all were engaged as well. A public open house was held on September 17, 2019.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54) - All Columbus and regional trail users will benefit from these improvements\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides safe connections to the regional trail network for nearby neighborhoods. The project will provide an overall safer trail and access to active mode of transportation for the nearby community.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $924,228.14 was legislated for Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Connector project by Ordinance 1280-2018 and 0046-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $102,876.04. $102,876.04 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,027,104.18.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Connector Project; to authorize the transfer of $102,876.04 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $102,876.04 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
