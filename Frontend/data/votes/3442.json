    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities (DPU) to modify its contract with K & M Kleening Service, Inc. to provide janitorial services for the following DPU Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) facilities: Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant, Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant, Compost Facility and the Sewer Maintenance Operations Center. Other sites may be added in the future.  \n \nThe work to be performed under the contract includes cleaning services for office areas and industrial type areas such as storerooms, stock rooms, construction trailers, areas adjacent to garages, kitchens and break rooms. The contractor shall furnish any and all cleaners, disinfectants, waxes, wax stripping materials, wastebasket liners, toilet seat liners, sanitation products and any other products required to provide the cleaning services.  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids for the services in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code (RFQ007794). 95 vendors were solicited. One (1) bid was received and publicly opened on 2/14/18. The sole bidder was K & M Kleening Service, Inc. The bidder incorrectly added a 1% contingency instead of the specified 10% contingency, which would fund needed and approved changes to the scope of work. The bidder's total cost was corrected to include the 10% contingency. The City Attorney reviewed the bid and it was decided to be in the best interest of the City to waive provisions of competitive bidding and enter into contract with K & M Kleening Service, Inc.\n \nThe original contract was for one (1) year to and including April 1, 2019. The contract language permits the Department of Public Utilities to renew the contract for three (3) additional years based upon mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds, and approval of City Council. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. \n \nThis proposed modification #1 is for an unplanned fifth year of the contract in response to unforeseen issues in advertising new bids. The modification will extend the contract through September 30, 2022.\n \n1. Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification number 1 is $80,000.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $1,085,307.14.\n \n2. Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  The additional unplanned year of the contract is due to unforeseen issues advertising new bids.\n \n3. Reason other procurement processes not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4. How was cost determined:  The cost, terms, and conditions are in accordance with the original agreement.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nK & M Kleening Service, Inc.
