BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for the Comprehensive Master Plan Update Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690290-100004, Division of Water Contract No. 2233.\n \nThe Original Contract provided an update to both the Comprehensive and Water Distribution System Master plans. For the Comprehensive Water Master Plan Update, Arcadis conducted a broad assessment of Division of Water’s entire system and developed coordinated planning recommendations related to supply, treatment, water quality, and operations.  For the Water Distribution System Master Plan Update, Arcadis assessed the adequacy of the current distribution system to meet present and projected hydraulic and water quality needs relative to the distribution system, and recommended future modifications and operational changes.\n \nModification No. 1 (current) is needed due to unforeseen changes in development that resulted in significant increases in future demands.  The study was substantially complete, but will be reworked to include these increased demands and evaluate impacts to the supply, treatment and distribution systems.\n \nCommunity Planning area: 99 - Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $190,920.00\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $3,175,100.00                     (PO152484)  \nModification No. 1 (current):                     $   190,920.00 \nTotal (Orig. + Mod 1):                     $1,366,020.00 \n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nContract Modification No. 1 is needed due to unforeseen changes in development that resulted in significant increases in future demands.  The study was substantially complete, but will be reworked to include these increased demands and evaluate impacts to the supply, treatment and distribution systems. This modification will address topics not originally addressed in the contract.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis work is integrated with the ongoing design of the Comprehensive Master Plan and involves unique knowledge of the project which an additional design consultant would not possess.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nCost proposals were provided by Arcadis U.S., Inc., reviewed by the Division of Water, and were deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This project is necessary to update the population projections, service area growth, raw water supply and safe yield, water demands, etc.  Comprehensive and water distribution system master plans are both essential and integral components in ensuring there is an adequate, safe supply of water for economic growth and development of the Columbus area.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  57-0373224, expires 3/18/23, MAJ, DAX No. 9409\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis U.S., Inc.\n \n4. FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  A future modification may be needed as the work of the original agreement is ongoing and the impact this modification will have cannot be determined at this time. \n \n5.
