    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services (BZS) to enter into a professional services contract with RAMA Consulting Group, Inc., in an amount of up to $697,261.13   for Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Assistance for an initial 24-month period.  Because the project is expected to extend beyond two years, the contract will include two optional twelve-month extensions, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation. \n                     \nThis effort is necessary to act on the findings of an independent analysis which determined that the City’s Zoning Code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city.  An updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth.  Collaborative action will be critical in this effort and RAMA will be assisting the City in the Communications and Engagement aspects of the effort, including measures to reach underrepresented constituencies.  A companion piece of legislation authorizes the BZS director to enter into contract with Lisa Wise Consulting to assist the technical aspects of the update process.  \n \nThe Department of Finance, Purchasing Office solicited Requests for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Bonfire portal from January 19, 2022 to February 16, 2022.  The evaluation committee, including representatives from the Building and Zoning Services and Development departments, assessed the proposal and determined that it was highly responsive.  A representative of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion served as an advisor to the process.  The Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized contract negotiations between the City and RAMA, which were successful.    Emergency action is requested for this legislation in order to expedite this critical project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nRAMA Consulting Group, Inc.’s contract compliance number is 001370 and expires 9-13-2023.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 2240, the Development Services Fund. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a professional services contract with RAMA Consulting Group, Inc. for the Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Assistance; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of up to $697,261.13 within the Development Services Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency.
