    "description": "Explanation\n \nColumbus Public Health has been awarded additional grant monies from the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health (ADAMH) Board of Franklin County for the Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Division.  Ordinance # 0004-2022 authorized the appropriation of $ 2,485,108.11 in grant monies from the ADAMH Board of Franklin County for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The aforementioned Ordinance #004-2022 had included an appropriation of $863,232.00 for the 2021 Ohio State Opioid Response (SOR) Grant from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (OMHAS) through the ADAMH Board of Franklin County as part of the $2,485,108.11 award. Subsequently the ADAMH Board of Franklin County removed the $863,232.00 allocation for the 2021 Ohio SOR Grant. The new total award from the ADAMH Board of Franklin County including an additional $169,966.21 is $1,791,842.32. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate an additional $169,966.21 in grant monies to fund the following projects: Addiction Treatment Program (ATP), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment, and COVID-19 Mitigation. The additional funding for the projects totals $169,966.21 from the ADAMH Board of Franklin County for the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022.  \n \nThe Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Prevention Program will serve approximately 5,206 unique clients, who may receive multiple services, through Columbus City Schools, After School/Summer programs, Latina Prevention programming, HIV/Early Intervention sites, Parenting classes, and Recreation Centers. Of this number, approximately 2,200 adults and family members will be served; 2,066 children and adolescents through youth programming; and 940 transitional age youth will be served through youth mentoring, workforce development and programming. The ADS Comprehensive Treatment Program will provide treatment services to approximately 1024 men and women through the provision of Biopsychosocial Assessments, Individual, Intensive Outpatient and Outpatient counseling. Due to the ongoing Pandemic and the increased number of clients being out due to illness our projections may change throughout the year. 59% of the population to be served are men and 41% will be women. The Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program is projected to serve 40 unique clients who will be prescribed Suboxone, Sublocade or Vivitrol. Additional clients needing MAT services may be served through our collaboration with a partner agency.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible to maintain the clients' continuity of care. Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.   \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Alcohol and Drug Services' (ADS) additional funds are from the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services to the ADAMH Board of Franklin County for the Addiction Treatment Program (ATP), Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Treatment, and COVID19 Mitigation.    \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept additional funding from the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health (ADAMH) Board of Franklin County in the amount of $169,966.21;  to authorize the appropriation of $169,966.21 to the Health Department in the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
