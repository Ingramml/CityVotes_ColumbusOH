    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Orange Hearts for Makenzi Foundation in support of a new training program to support young entrepreneurs.\n \nMakenzi Ridley was tragically killed in the summer of 2021 shortly after her high school graduation. Makenzi was an entrepreneur, running a home décor and beauty boutique with plans to open a food truck. In her honor, the Orange Hearts for Makenzi Foundation has developed a six-week training program for teen entrepreneurs.\n \nOrange Hearts targets at-risk youth and disadvantaged young adults in Columbus who are interested in entrepreneurship. Through the six-week program, participants receive coaching, mentoring, and technical support. Participants have the opportunity to earn scholarships towards their work by presenting business plans.\n \nEntrepreneurship is a unique and critical path to economic advancement. According to a Fidelity Investment study, 88% of millionaires are self-made. According to Pew Research, 16 million Americans are self-employed. Equipping young people with the tools for business ownership will help fill the gap of education and create paths to financial independence.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure the timely launch of this summer program for Columbus youth.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Orange Hearts for Makenzi Foundation to support the creation of a youth-focused entrepreneurship program; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
