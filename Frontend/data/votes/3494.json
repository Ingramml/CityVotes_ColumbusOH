    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of various city departments, to exercise a renewal option of a contract with ConvergeOne, Inc. for maintenance and support services associated with the Genesys Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. The cost to renew the contract for these services totals $183,579.61 and is for a one-year period, beginning on April 30, 2022 and ending on April 29, 2023.\n \nVarious city agencies use the current IVR system, including 311, Public Utilities, Building and Zoning Services and Technology. On April 26, 2021, Ordinance 0724-2021 passed, authorizing a contract, via a waiver of competitive bids, with ConvergeOne to continue maintenance and support of the system. At that time, ConvergeOne submitted a five-year quote, to be renewed (with Council approval) on an annual basis. DoT requests that the aforementioned contract be renewed for a second year to ensure continuation the noted services, which will allow the department sufficient time to bid out maintenance and support for the entire system. Bidding out the entire system is necessary because Genesys has a policy of not allowing multiple parties to support their IVR systems. Thus, until DoT can develop comprehensive specifications, the department requests that the contract with ConvergeOne be renewed and that the provisions of competitive bidding be waived in this instance.\n \nThe quote attached to this ordinance covers maintenance and support services for the entirety of the City's existing IVR environment for a five-year period. Year-one was authorized via Ordinance 0724-2021 (noted above). This Ordinance authorizes coverage for year two, as indicated on pages two and 3 of the attached quote. \n \nThis ordinance also requests that sections of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes, pertaining to competitive bidding, be waived.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $183,579.61 for the above-described purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to ensure that the contract and purchase order(s) for the above-described services occur in a timely manner to ensure service provision without interruption.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER\nVendor Name: ConvergeOne, Inc.\nCC#: 41-1763228, Expiration Date: 3/28/2024\nDAX Vendor Acct. #:007864\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract are budgeted and available in the 2022 Information Services Operating Budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of various city departments, to renew a contract with ConvergeOne, Inc. for maintenance and support services associated with the city's Interactive Voice Response System; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $183,579.61 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
