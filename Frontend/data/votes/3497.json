    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish a contract for the option to purchase the software services of Aquiire Marketplace, with Coupa, Inc.  This is an electronic catalog administered by the Purchasing Office. It is made available to City staff, allowing them to purchase items from universal term contracts.  Currently, there are over 440 contracts containing over 5 million items in the electronic catalog.  The electronic catalog aggregates catalog content from City universal term contracts and externally manages the content from a single site. It was the source for over 33,600 universal term contract catalog purchase orders totaling $83 million in 2021.  The use of the electronic catalog provides efficiency for city agencies. In addition, it ensures that items are purchased that are actually on contract and that the City is paying the actual contract price.  The original contract and subsequent renewals were established in accordance with and authorized under Ordinance Numbers 1963-2019, 1159-2020, and 0991-2021 respectably.  At that time Aquiire Marketplace, with Coupa, Inc. was the only known catalog with real time search capability of vendor’s online catalogs.  The current agreement will expire June 20, 2022.\n \nDue to the critical nature of software services that support the electronic catalog, we respectfully request that the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes be waived to continue this relationship with the existing provider while the City competitively selects a new provider through a Best Value Procurement.\n \nIn accordance with the contract specifications, the City and Coupa Software, Inc. can renew the contract for an additional one year, this one-year term is subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City Authorities. The new contract expiration date will be June 20, 2023.  \n \nCoupa Software, Inc. - CC030001 - Expires March 11, 2023\n \nTotal Estimated Annual Expenditure: $207,375.00, Division of Finance and Management, primary user. \n \nEmergency Designation:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency ordinance. By executing this contract prior to April 30, 2022 the City will be able to avoid a 5% increase over the previous contract and save $10,368.75 with the new contract.\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Parties listing of the Federal Government and are not listed in the Auditor of States database for Findings for Recovery.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $207,375.00 with Coupa Software, Inc. for the cost of the annual renewal of the Aquiire Marketplace Software contract. These funds are budgeted in the Finance and Management Department General Fund Budget.  In 2021, $207,375.00 was expended for this service.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into a one-year contract with a 1 year renewal option with Coupa Software, Inc., for the continuation of hosted software solutions and professional services related to the Aquiire Marketplace Software; to authorize the expenditure of $207,375.00 from the General Fund; to waive the provisions of competitive bidding; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into contract PO184747, Aquiire Marketplace Software - Annual Subscription, for use by citywide staff and needs to continue its relationship with Coupa Software, Inc., in order to provide citywide users with an electronic catalog; and\n \nWHEREAS, a waiver of competitive bidding is requested, based upon recent research the Purchasing Office discovered one vendor that has the potential to provide the opportunity for competition.  Due to the time constraints, there is not enough time to conduct a formal RFP process. Months will be needed to implement a potential new software. It is also important to continue functionality and compatibility with the City’s current financial planning system Microsoft D365.  The Purchasing Office will conduct a competitive process with the intention of awarding a competitively bid contract to begin in summer 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Aquiire Marketplace hosts the electronic catalog that includes over 440 universal term contracts with vendors containing over five million items, this software was the source for over 33,600 universal term contract catalog purchase orders totaling $83 million in 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, in accordance with the contract specifications, the City and Coupa Software, Inc., can renew the contract for an additional one year period, subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City authorities; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management, Purchasing Office, in that it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to immediately enter into a contract with Coupa Software, Inc. for professional services and hosted software solutions, ensuring staff have access to City universal term contracts and to take advantage of contract savings of $10,368.75, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to enter into a contract for the software services of Aquiire Marketplace with Coupa Software, Inc., for a period of one year, from June 21, 2022 up to and including June 20, 2023 with the option to renew for one (1) additional year and to authorize the expenditure of $207,375.00 from the General Fund.\n \n \nSECTION 2.  That this Council finds it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to waive the provisions of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding in order to permit the aforementioned purchase.\nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $207,375.00 is hereby authorized from the General Fund of this ordinance to pay the cost thereof.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.
