    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services (BZS) to enter into a professional services contract with Lisa Wise Consulting (LWC), Inc., in an amount of up to $1,849,637.00 for the Zoning Code and Map Update project for an initial 24-month period.  Because the project is expected to extend beyond two years, the contract will include two optional twelve-month extensions, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation. \n                     \nThis effort is necessary to act on the findings of an independent analysis which determined that the City’s Zoning Code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city.  An updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth. Recognizing that collaborative action will be critical in this effort, a companion piece of legislation authorizes the BZS director to enter into contract with RAMA Consulting to assist in communication and engagement during the update process.  \n \nThe Department of Finance, Purchasing Office solicited Requests for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Zoning Code and Map Update contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Bonfire portal from December 14, 2021 to January 26, 2022.  The RFP was shared with respondents to the earlier Zoning Code Assessment RFP and advertised through the state and national websites of the American Planning Association.  A submission was received from Lisa Wise Consulting (LWC), the firm which undertook the earlier Zoning Code Assessment work.  The evaluation committee, including representatives from the Building and Zoning Services, Development and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion assessed the proposal and determined that it was highly responsive. The Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized contract negotiations between the City and LWC, which were successful.    Emergency action is requested for this legislation in order to expedite this critical project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nLisa Wise Consulting’s contract compliance number is CC033454 and expires August 31, 2022.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 2240, the Development Services Fund. The 2022 budget included $1,000,000 for this project and this ordinance authorizes an additional appropriation of $849,637.00.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a professional services contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. for the Zoning Code and Map Update project; and to authorize an appropriation of $849,637.00 within the Development Services Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,849,637.00 from the Development Services Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency. ($1,849,637.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City undertook an independent analysis of the Zoning Code and process, which determined that the current code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city; and \n \nWHEREAS, an updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Finance, Purchasing Office solicited Requests for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Zoning Code and Map Update contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, Lisa Wise Consulting submitted a responsive proposal as determined by the evaluation committee and the Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized negotiations with the firm; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to enter into a contract with Lisa Wise Consulting for the provision of professional consulting services described above in the amount of up to $1,849,637.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, because the project is expected to extend beyond two years, the contract will include two optional twelve-month extensions beyond the initial 24-month period, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with Lisa Wise Consulting in order to expedite this critical project, all for the preservation of the public peace, property, health safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
