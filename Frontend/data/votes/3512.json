    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with IMPACT Community Action in amount up to $312,956.00 for services starting January 1, 2022.\n \nEach year, the Department’s Human Services Grant Program disburses between $4M and $5M to local, not-for-profit agencies to provide services to residents in need.  In 2018, a request for proposals was issued via direct email to agencies (and City partners to send to their networks of agencies), by press release, and posting on the City’s website.   The City received 142 proposals representing 101 agencies with over $19 million in requests.  Of those, 44 programs were selected for funding in 2019 and agreements were authorized under ordinance 1170-2019.  These agreements were renewed in 2020 under the authority of ordinance 0571-2020.  Due to COVID-19 and its impact on the nonprofit sector and department priorities, the department had elected to extend these agreements in FY 2021 and FY2022 through an agreement modification, authorized by ordinances 0388-2021 and 0579-2022, respectively.\n \nIMPACT was a recipient of these funds for their Build Up Program starting in 2019.  Because of COVID 19, the program was put on hold for 2020 and 2021 and these modifications were not executed.  The program has resumed in 2022.  IMPACT will expand the program in 2022, with additional financial support that was not used in 2020 and 2021 along with a small amount of unused funds from 2019.\n \nThis ordinance will provide additional support in an amount up to $312,956.00 for expansion of the program in 2022.  Planned funding for the 2022 program is authorized under ordinance 0579-2022.\n \nThe Build Up Program is a 5-week introductory construction trades training program using the National Center for Construction Education Research curriculum.  Build Up also offers a 12 week Level I Carpentry career pathway in the construction trades. Central Ohio is growing rapidly and is predicted to double in size by 2050.  There is a labor shortage that must be addressed with immediate training programs as well as pipeline programs working with students who we can begin training today for jobs of the future.\n \nThe demand for workers in the skilled trades has increased significantly.  IMPACT has more and more demands for Electricians and candidates for career pathways in the Green Economy IMPACT will add another classroom and run multiple classes based up the interest and skill set of the students.  \n \nIn alignment with the City of Columbus Climate Action Plan, IMPACT Community Action will offer a solar installer career pathway in our Build Up Program. IMPACT is working to become the Ohio training partner for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association Training program. The Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA) offers industry-leading professional training for solar photovoltaics (PV). MREA courses are accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council and meet the educational requirements for credentialing by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners.\n \nIMPACT’s primary customers are low-income residents of Franklin County.  However, with City funding, it will be able to serve Columbus City residents who may be above 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, yet are still in need of Impact’s Build Up initiatives. These training services are not able to be provided by existing City employees.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available on ACPO006473 (ord. 0388-2021) in the amount of $134,978.00 and funding is available in the Administration Division’s 2022 General Fund budget in the amount of $177,978.00, for a total contract amount of $312,956.00.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 001447 and expires 11/17/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a not-for-profit services contract with IMPACT Community Action in an amount up to $312,978.00; authorize the expenditure of up to $177,978.00 from the General Fund; to and to declare an emergency ($177,978.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2018 the City received 142 proposals representing 101 agencies with over $19 million in requests; and\n \nWHEREAS, 44 programs were selected for up to 2 years of funding (FY2019 and FY2020) through the City’s competitive funding process and its Human Services Grant Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, due to COVID-19, the department had elected to modify the agreements for FY2021 and FY2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, IMPACT was a recipient of these funds for their Build Up Program starting in 2019.  Because of COVID 19, the program was put on hold for 2020 and 2021 and these modifications were not executed.  The program has resumed in 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, IMPACT will expand the program in 2022, with additional financial support that was not used in 2020 and 2021 along with a small amount of unused funds from 2019; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to enter into an agreement with IMPACT Community Action to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with IMPACT Community Action in amount up to $312,956.00 for services starting January 1, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That the expenditure of $177,978.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-01 (Administration), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.                     Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.                       That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
