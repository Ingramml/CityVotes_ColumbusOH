    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes and directs the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Urban League in support of the Right to Recover program.\n \nAccording to a July study on the impact of COVID-19 in major US cities, more than half of residents report experiencing serious financial problems, especially people of color. Additionally, the infection rate in Columbus has historically been around four times as high for Hispanic residents and twice as high for Black residents when compared to white residents. These statistics are illustrative of the fact that the industries that disproportionately employ workers of color are also the most likely to require in-person work and are least likely to offer paid time off or pay wages that provide their employees with the resources needed to sustain a period of unpaid leave. This also increases the likelihood for spread among employees, customers, and the broader community.\n \nSince its inception in late 2020, the Right to Recover program has aided 759 low-income workers with COVID-19 by providing one-time emergency financial relief to help them take time off of work, isolate, and recover in order to return to the workforce and mitigate the risk of spreading COVID-19. More than 79% of recipients were people of color, of which 62% were African-American. Columbus Urban League estimates with this additional funding will help them provide this resource to approximately 570 additional residents in need through the middle of 2021.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Basic City Services subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid interruption to the Right to Recover Program and the flow of resources it provides to those afflicted with COVID-19.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Urban League in support of the Right to Recover initiative; to authorize an appropriation within the Basic City Services subfund; to authorize a transfer between subfunds; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the general fund; and to declare an emergency. ($800,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an infection rate among people of color in Columbus that far exceeds the infection rate for white residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, in major US cities, more than half of residents report experiencing serious financial problems, especially people of color, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n \nWHEREAS, the low-wage industries that disproportionately employ workers of color are also the most likely to require in-person work and are least likely to offer paid time off or pay wages that provide their employees with the resources needed to sustain a period of unpaid leave; and\n \nWHEREAS, by offering emergency one-time emergency financial relief, the Right to Recover program currently offers residents the financial resources they need to take time off of work, isolate, and recover in order to return to the workforce and mitigate the risk of spreading COVID-19; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Right to Recover program has aided 759 low-income workers with COVID-19 since its inception in late 2020, 79% of whom being people of color, and this additional funding will allow Columbus Urban League to serve approximately 570 additional residents through the middle of 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily business of the city in that it is immediately necessary to authorize a grant agreement to avoid interruption to the Right to Recover Program and the flow of resources it provides to those afflicted with COVID-19; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
