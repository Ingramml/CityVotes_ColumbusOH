    "title": "To accept the application (AN21-017) of Eugene and Myra Carty et al for the annexation of certain territory containing 4.8 acres in Plain Township.",
    "description": "Explanation\nAN21-017\nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance approves the acceptance of certain territory (AN21-017) by the city of Columbus and authorizes its transfer from Plain Township to Montgomery Township per an annexation agreement between the City and the Township. The Ohio Revised Code stipulates that to be effective, City acceptance must take place a minimum of 60 days from the receipt by the City Clerk of the approval notice from the county. If City Council does not accept the ordinance within 120 days of its first consideration, the annexation will be considered rejected. This petition was filed with Franklin County on December 29, 2021. Franklin County approved the annexation on January 18, 2022 and the City Clerk received notice on February 22, 2022. No service ordinance was required because this annexation was filed as a Type 1 application as defined by the ORC. Although not required, a service statement reflecting the City’s ability to provide services for this site upon annexation is attached.\nThe use of a Type 1 annexation application is stipulated in the annexation agreement between the City and Plain Township. The annexation agreement also requires that territory annexed to the City of Columbus from Plain Township be transferred to Montgomery Township. This ordinance authorizes the submission of a petition to the Board of County Commissioners of Franklin County, Ohio, requesting that the boundary lines of Montgomery Township be changed to make them identical with the corporate limits of the City of Columbus for this annexation. The petition will be filed in accordance with Section 503.07 of the Ohio Revised Code. The subject site is also located within the City’s Northeast Pay-As-We-Grow (PAWG) area and if developed will be subject to PAWG funding mechanisms applicable to the site.\nFISCAL IMPACT:\nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \nTitle\nTo accept the application (AN21-017) of Eugene and Myra Carty et al for the annexation of certain territory containing 4.8 acres in Plain Township.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a petition for the annexation of certain territory in Plain Township was filed on behalf of Eugene and Myra Carty et al on December 29, 2021; and\nWHEREAS, the petition was considered and approved by the Franklin County Board of Commissioners at a hearing on January 18, 2022; and\nWHEREAS, on February 22, 2022, the City Clerk received from Franklin County a certified copy of the resolution addressing the petition; and\nWHEREAS, sixty days have now elapsed since receipt of the resolution in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the city of Columbus to accept the annexation of the territory addressed by the petition; and\nWHEREAS, the annexation agreement between Plain Township and the City of Columbus requires the City to transfer territory annexed from Plain Township to the city of Columbus and to conform the\nboundaries of Montgomery Township to make them identical with the corporate limits of the city; now, therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\nSECTION 1.
