    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the issuance of a refund, representing the unspent balance of monies deposited to support the construction of certain railroad bridge improvements, to NRI Equity Land Investments, LLC (NRI) relative to the Grandview Yard - Third Ave Railroad Bridge: Roadway Improvements - Third Ave Phase 2, Rail St Phase 3 and 5th/Edgehill Signal Improvements project.   \n \nThe aforementioned project culminated in various public infrastructure improvements in Grandview Yard, including: replacement of the CSX railroad overpass; widening and reconstruction of the portion of Third Avenue adjacent to the railroad bridge; construction of a new 3-lane roadway (Rail Street) south of Third Avenue; replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Edgehill Road; and installation of sidewalk, curb ramps, and a shared use path. \n \nPursuant to Ordinances 1195-2016 and 1196-2016, the City, acting through the Department of Public Service, executed a Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement and Construction Contribution Agreement with NRI, whereby the developer NRI agreed to provide an upfront contribution in excess of $9 million to facilitate the construction of those improvements. \n \nA portion of that funding was appropriated to support a construction contract with CSX Transportation (CSX), which operates within the project limits, to facilitate the temporary and final track realignment in coordination with the construction of the project. The initial estimate of the cost to complete that work was $1,008,897.00. However, it was subsequently determined that sum would be insufficient to pay the actual costs incurred, prompting NRI to deposit additional monies with the City to support the anticipated overruns, previously estimated to be $1,116,386.00.   \n \nCSX recently submitted its final invoice for payment to the Department of Public Service, and upon performing final accounting, Public Service staff determined NRI is owed a refund in the amount of $154,375.13, which represents the unspent balance of the funding NRI previously deposited with the City to advance the construction of the railroad bridge improvements.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $154,375.13 is available within Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Improvements (Non-Bond) Fund, Project P530164-100000 to satisfy the obligation owed to NRI.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned expenditure.  The funds are appropriated.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to facilitate the return of unused developer-deposited construction funding to NRI as soon as reasonably practicable. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to refund the sum of $154,375.13 to NRI Investments for the unspent portion of developer-deposited construction funding for Grandview Yard improvement projects;
