    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Tyevco Inc. for the Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot and Site Improvements Project. The contract amount is $43,540.00, with a contingency of $6,460.00, for a total of $50,000.00 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance. \n \nThe Cultural Arts Center (CAC) Parking Lot is mainly used for Columbus Recreation and Parks Department staff and program participants. This facility and lot also hosts guests during special events, including festivals, weddings, and other special engagements. The Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot is constructed of brick pavers, including both historical pavers and new replacement pavers. Over time, areas of the brick paver lot have warped from the force applied from vehicles making turns, causing bricks to pop out and expose the subgrade of the parking lot. The damaged parking lot poses significant safety issues and trip hazards, increasing the chance for pedestrians to fall and/or twist ankles. Leaving the damaged lot as is will also accelerate further damage and increasing safety hazards. The parking lot was repaired within the last five years but the repair was insufficient in addressing the problem causing the brick pavers to warp out of place. This contract will construct a long term and resilient solution for the brick paver parking lot. The historical brick pavers will be preserved and the warped brick paver lot will be repaired using a more heavy-duty detail. Additionally, a concrete pad and 4 bike racks will be installed as part of these improvements. Construction is scheduled to occur from May 16, 2022 through May 29, 2022 in order to not impact any scheduled events. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were originally advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 11, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on January 25, 2022. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nTyevco Inc. (MAJ): $43,540.00\nProCon Professional Construction Services, Inc. (MAJ): $59,453.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Tyevco Inc. was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Tyevco Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTyevco Inc.\n1678 West Audubon Blvd., Lancaster, Ohio 43130                                                      \nJames Boggess, 614-284-0251                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005691, 31-1626034\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 27, 2023       \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the contractor can complete all necessary work between May 16, 2022 and May 29, 2022 in order to not impact any scheduled events.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The improvements to the parking lot will increase safety for all Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot users and will mitigate long term damage to the existing historical brick paver lot.
