    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Legat Architects for professional services for the Aquatic Capital Improvement Program 2020 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $187,530.00.\n \nLearning how to swim and safely enjoy the water is a life-long skill. This recreational activity is a core priority of the Recreation and Parks Department. In 2019, the department completed a system-wide strategic plan to analyze the state of recreational facilities, programs, inclusivity, and access for residents to parks, trails, sports, and pools. A key finding of the plan was that the city’s aquatics program, serving thousands of youth and adults city-wide, was in substantial need of an updated capital improvement implementation program to determine how to handle the system’s aging pools, increased demand, and rapidly growing population.\n \nIn early February 2021, Ordinance 0161-2021 authorized the Department to conduct a comprehensive analysis of all of the Department’s 14 pools and spray grounds as well as the indoor Columbus Aquatics Center. A preliminary inventory shows that Columbus lags far behind cities of similar size with available pool space, access, financial sustainability, location, along with substantial maintenance costs due to aging facilities well beyond their service life.  \n \nThe project involved a full assessment of all the city’s aquatic facilities, including operating costs, mechanical components, electrical components, interior conditions, exterior conditions, ADA compliance, programming constraints, and populations served. The project also included robust public engagement with key stakeholders and neighborhoods to help reach consensus on what trends, needs, and goals for success can be achieved in the next 10 years.\n \nBy modifying this contract, we will finish the master plan and advance the design of five identified facilities. These facilities will include the Aquatics Center, Marion Franklin Pool, Tuttle Pool, a prototype generic outdoor facility, and a prototype indoor facility. This additional $187,530.00 is a planned modification that was anticipated at the beginning of this project. Initially this project determined what our aquatics programs and facilities should consist of. Once that was determined, the project is finished by putting anticipated costs into a capital plan. It is not in the best interests of the department to award this continued work through another procurement process and vendor due to the fact that Legat has prepared approximately three-quarters of the project to date. The price for this modification was determined using exiting hourly rates established in the initial contract multiplied by anticipated hours to complete the project.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nLegat Architects, Inc.\n22 East Gay Street, Suite 500\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                     \nCarli Sekalla 614-228-7758                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 026669, 36-3003268\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 30, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the design development of the facilities listed can move forward to completion without delay, keeping disruption to swim seasons to a minimum during future construction. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Columbus is the 14th largest city in the nation and has experienced record growth over the last five years. Coupled with this growth is a substantial increase in the need for quality recreational opportunities that can serve a diverse, active, and inclusive population. This comprehensive Aquatics Capital Improvement Program and planning effort analyzes the condition of both indoor and outdoor aquatics facilities. By conducting an analysis of partnering opportunities with private aquatic centers, facilitating community outreach to validate the benefits of existing aquatics facilities, and providing recommendations for future aquatics expansion throughout Columbus, this documentation is critical to the success of our aquatics programs.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: As part of this project, residents and organizations have been engaged to help determine programming needs, revenue generating ideas, and the desires of the communities impacted by this project. The communities have expressed a strong desire for additional aquatic facilities for recreation, especially for relief during the heat of the summer and indoor opportunities during the cold weather months. Of utmost importance of our aquatics programs are the safety impact of them, teaching the fundamentals of swimming and providing the locations to practice these skills.  These numbers can be greatly increased with updates to the current facilities and expanding aquatics into additional Columbus neighborhoods.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by performing an overall assessment of the productivity of aquatics spaces and amenities to guide improvements. This long range plan will guide future improvements to existing facilities and expansions of the system. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $306,560.00 was legislated for Aquatics Capital Improvements Program 2020 Project by Ordinance 0161-2021. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $187,530.00. $187,530.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $494,090.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Legat Architects for the Aquatic Capital Improvement Program 2020 Project; to authorize the transfer of $187,530.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $187,530.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
