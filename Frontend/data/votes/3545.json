    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Pizzuti Solutions, LLC for professional and owner’s representation services for the Broad Street Arts and Senior Center Campus Project. This project was originally called The Community Creative Campus and Park but has recently been renamed. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $677,350.00.\n \nThis project’s mission is to support the ability of the Recreation and Parks Department to meet the needs of Columbus residents for creative and senior facilities. The project will stimulate and support creative and senior residents while also providing important park space for the Olde Towne East Community. \nThis planned modification to the contract with Pizzuti Solutions will allow them to continue to assist the department with the Phase II design and construction development of this project.  The planning and preliminary engineering work in this contract is complete. The next phase that is underway is for detailed design development.  By modifying this contract, Pizzuti will continue their Owner’s Representation Services through the design and construction phases of this project as well. The need for these additional funds and services were foreseen and this modification was planned. It is not in our best interest to procure services from another vendor as there is not another vendor with the knowledge and experience to successfully complete this project at its current stage of development. The costs for this modification were determined using the established rates in the current contract with Pizzuti multiplied by the anticipated hours to complete a well-documented scope of services.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nPizzuti Solutions, LLC, Inc.\n629 North High Street                                               \nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                     \nJames Russell 614-280-4038                                                  \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 008612, 46-2372444\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 8, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the project is underway and is this modification is necessary to avoid delays. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Providing park and facility space in the Olde Towne East Community is a high priority for the City of Columbus.  The project will develop a facility that will combine the activities previously housed in the former Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis Center, promoting major components of healthy aging. The project will also provide critical inclusive park and facility space for the residents of Olde Towne East, one of the City’s most underserved communities for recreation amenities.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Staff and participants from the current facilities being replaced and residents of Olde Towne East will be engaged to gain an understanding of what programming, spaces, and outcomes they value and how the Recreation and Department might work to enhance their experiences.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Near East (54) - The creative and senior programming elements at this future facility and park will serve all resident of Columbus, Citywide. \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by providing diverse, inclusive, and affordable recreational opportunities for all ages. The project also will provide ways to increase the operational efficiency and sustainability of the department.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $330,000.00 was legislated for the Broad Street Arts and Senior Campus Project, formerly known as the Community Campus Project, by Ordinance 2518-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $677,350.00. $677,350.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
