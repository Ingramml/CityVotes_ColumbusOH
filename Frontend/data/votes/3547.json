($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to transfer maintenance responsibilities and ownership of 1334 East Livingston Avenue to the Land Redevelopment Division of the Department of Development. This ordinance will also authorize the Department of Development to enter into a lease agreement with the Rickenbacker Woods Technology Museum and Historic Park. This would allow for the already established and supported partnership to continue with Rickenbacker Woods Technology Museum and Historic Park, a non-profit entity originally created in 2003 to manage the museum.  \n \nBy Ordinance 1277-1998, Columbus City Council authorized the purchase of 1334 East Livingston Avenue by the City Attorney on the behalf of the Department of Recreation and Parks. The house at this location is the boyhood home of Eddie Rickenbacker and is a National Landmark. Ordinance 1038-2001 authorized the Department of Development to accept an Ohio Department of Administrative Services grant to acquire property next to the house, restore the Rickenbacker home, and create a museum.  Starting in 2004, exterior renovations were started and managed by the Department of Development. In 2015, as authorized by Ordinance 1767-2015, the Department of Development transferred parcels surrounding the house to the Rickenbacker Woods Technology Museum and Historic Park (Rickenbacker Woods Museum), a non-profit entity, originally created in 2003, to manage the museum. Rickenbacker Woods Museum renovated buildings that were a part of the transfer into an office and a community center. The organization currently operates various programs, including a successful youth afterschool program, out of the community center. Repairs were also performed to the Rickenbacker house but the house interior remained untouched. This Ordinance will transfer maintenance responsibilities and control of 1334 East Livingston Avenue to the Land Redevelopment Division of the Department of Development and authorize the Department to enter into a lease agreement with the Rickenbacker Woods Museum. Rickenbacker Woods Museum is in the process of securing a State of Ohio grant to complete additional renovations to the house’s interior to turn the house into an improved museum.  The lease is a requirement of the grant.       \n \nAdditional background and history of this site is noted below:\n \nOrdinance 1277-1998 authorized the purchase and states that the property is to be used for “recreation and parkland purposes”.  Background of the ordinance indicates that the house would be leased to the Columbus Housing Partnership who would “manage the property until other funding sources can be identified to operate it as a museum”.  \n \nOrdinance 3178-1998 authorized the Recreation and Parks Department to execute a five year lease with the Columbus Housing Partnership for the Rickenbacker House.  \n \nOrdinance 2640-2000 authorized the Department of Trade and Development to accept a grant from the National Park Service in the amount of $10,000.00 to develop an historic structures report for the Eddie Rickenbacker House.\n \nOrdinance 1038-2001 authorized the Department of Development to accept a $475,000 grant from Ohio Department of Administrative Services in order to purchase parcels, restore the Rickenbacker home, and create a museum.\n \nOrdinance 1361-2004 authorized the Department of Development to enter into contract with Neighborhood Design Center to oversee rehab of the Rickenbacker Woods Project. This ordinance was later amended by 1834-2004 to authorize and direct the Director of Development to enter the contract referenced above but for the lesser amount of $280.000.00. \n \nOrdinance 0355-2007 authorized the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a contract with Neighborhood Design Center for the administration of the Rickenbacker House Project at a cost of $100,000.00.  \n \nOrdinance 0960-2008 authorized the Department of Development to extend its contract with the Neighborhood Design Center.\n \nOrdinance 2804-2012 authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an agreement with Rickenbacker Woods Technology Museum and Historical Park, Inc. to provide management services for the properties on East Livingston Avenue known as the Rickenbacker Woods Technology Museum and Historical Park.\n \nOrdinance 1767-2015 authorized the Department of Development to execute any and all necessary agreements for the use, operation, lease, and management of the Eddie Rickenbacker House, described as 1334 Livingston Avenue - 010-041716.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nRickenbacker Woods Technology Museum and Historic Park              \n1330 E.
