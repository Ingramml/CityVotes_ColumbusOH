    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an engineering agreement with HNTB Ohio, Inc. for the SMART Lighting Phase Two, Task One Design project, CIP 670878-100002 in the amount up to $400,000.00, and the SMART Lighting, Task Two Ohio State University Design project, CIP 670878-100021 in the amount up to $276,000.00, with a total amount up to $676,000.00 for the Division of Power.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Power has initiated a smart street lighting project to convert existing HPS luminaires to LED lighting, and to connect them to a central control system. The first task assigned is design of the Phase 2 project area from the Columbus Citywide Smart Street Lighting Strategic Deployment Plan which includes parts of the Southside and Livingston Avenue area commissions. The second task assigned is smart lighting design for the areas located near the Ohio State University. The work will include all survey, engineering and consulting services associated with the design to replace the existing HPS streetlights with LED lights and to install communication facilities necessary for smart lighting. \n \nTwo additional contract renewals, subject to City Council approval, will include additional LED replacement and smart lighting design tasks. \n \n670878-100002 - SMART Lighting Phase Two, Task One Design project is smart lighting design of the Phase 2 project area from the Columbus Citywide Smart Street Lighting Strategic Deployment Plan. This includes parts of the Southside and Livingston Avenue area commissions. \n670878-100021 - SMART Lighting, Task Two Ohio State University Design project is smart lighting design for the areas located near the Ohio State University campus. This includes parts of the Near North/University Area, South Linden and West Olentangy planning areas. \n \nThe planning area for this project is “Citywide” (Planning Area 99).\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT: \nImplementing Smart Lighting will allow the Division to not only control the streetlights from a central operating system, it will also notify staff immediately when an outage occurs, which will improve response times to outages. Replacing old HPS fixtures with LED technology will generate savings in electric energy, reduce greenhouse gases and long-term maintenance.  Additionally, the replacement of aging HPS luminaires with new LED fixtures will provide greater light output and better color rendering.  This will help pedestrians and motorists better identify objects at night. This has many benefits including improving traffic and pedestrian safety, and providing residents a better sense of safety and security. This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \nPROCUREMENT: The Department of Public Utilities advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP’s) for SMART Lighting Phase Two on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites that closed on December 3, 2021.  The city received four (4) proposals from the following firms: HNTB Ohio, Inc., Mannik and Smith Group, TEC Engineering, and Qualcomm.  Three of the four proposals were evaluated in accordance with Columbus City Code Title 3, Chapter 329. The Qualcomm proposal was deemed non-responsive.  \nHNTB Ohio’s Contract Compliance Number is 43-1628397 (expires 4/1/22, MAJ); DAX Vendor Account No. is 8025.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure for the SMART Lighting Phase Two, Task One Design in the amount up to $400,000.00, and an expenditure for SMART Lighting, Task Two Ohio State University Design project in the amount up to $276,000.00, with a total amount of up to $676,000.00 from the Electricity Bond Fund 6303; a transfer within the Electricity G.O. Bond Fund 6303 of up to $676,000.00, and an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary. \nTIMELINE: All work shall be substantially completed within 270 calendar days of the notice to proceed with final completion to occur within 365 days. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is not requested at this time. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an engineering contract with HNTB Ohio, Inc. for the SMART Lighting Phase Two, Task One Design project in the amount up to $400,000.00; and the SMART Lighting Task Two Ohio State University Design project in the amount up to $276,000.00, with a total amount up to $676,000.00; and to authorize a transfer within and an expenditure of up to $676,000.00 from the Electricity G.O.
