    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the service contract with Atlas-SSI, Inc. for the removal and upgrade of intake water screens at the Dublin Road Water Plant, Capital Improvements Project No. 690278-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2330.\n \nThe original ordinance, 1510-2020, provided for two planned 1 year renewals in 2021 and 2022. This is the second renewal to the contract. \n \nThe overall contract will rehabilitate up to three raw water screens at the Dublin Road Water Treatment Plant.  Rehabilitation will include removal of the screen, shipment to the vendor’s facility, removal of existing coatings and installation of new coatings, and replacement of wear parts with new parts, shipment back to the plant, and reinstallation. \n \nThe first screen was rehabilitated in 2020 (original contact), the second screen was rehabilitated in 2021 (renewal no. 1, and the third screen will be rehabilitated in 2022 (this renewal).\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” since the DRWP serves multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $153,945.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $ 137,170.00                     (PO238974)\nRenewal No. 1:                      $ 150,700.00                     (PO275276)\nRenewal No. 2 (current):                     $ 153,945.00\nTotal (Orig. + Rens.)                     $ 441,815.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe initial contract anticipated rehabilitation of three raw water screens, with one screen being rehabilitated under the initial contract, the second screen under renewal #1, and the third screen under renewal #2.  Bidding out the work for this third screen would deviate from the initial contract, require additional effort by the City, and increase the cost and time to rehabilitate the screen.\n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe renewal #2 cost was determined by taking the vendor’s February 3, 2022 proposal cost ($139,950) for completing the base scope of work plus the additional work and adding a 10% contingency ($139,950 * 1.1 = $153,945).  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  The DRWP provides potable water to a large portion of the City’s service areas and the raw water screens are a critical component of the water treatment process.  This project is necessary to maintain the reliability of the water treatment process.  All work will be conducted within secure areas of the water plant that is not accessible to the public, so no public meetings are anticipated.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  DAX #22140, CC #64-0900660, expires 5/8/22 (MAJ)\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Atlas-SSI, Inc.\n \n4.
