    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Duke’s Root Control, Inc. for a program to kill root growth in sanitary sewer lines 6” to 36” in diameter and inhibit root re-growth. The Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) wishes to enter into a contract to and including December 31, 2022, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to sole source procurement.\n \nDOSD determined that the chemical diquat dibromide is the most effective way to treat roots in sewers. Diquat dibromide, classified as non-carcinogenic and not considered a volatile compound, is approved by the United States EPA for this use. Additionally, diquat dibromide has little or no effect on treatment plant processes, making this chemical preferred for use in the root control program. The Division has further determined that other chemicals are not acceptable for use in this program due to either ineffectiveness or the presence of metam sodium, which the US EPA classifies as a likely carcinogen.\n \nDuke’s Root Control, Inc. is the only commercial applicator licensed to apply diquat dibromide, otherwise known as Razorooter II, which is a patented technology. Duke’s Root Control, Inc. is registered with the Ohio Department of Agriculture and its applicators are certified by the agency to perform pesticide applications to sewers. \n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nDuke’s Root Control, Inc., EIN #75-3026801,  D365 #010159, Expires April 29, 2022\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$110,000.00 is budgeted and available within the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund for this purchase.\n \n$213,008.95 was spent in 2021\n$47,139.65 was spent in 2020\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract, in accordance with sole source provisions of the City Code, with Duke’s Root Control, Inc. for sewer root control services for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, and to authorize the expenditure of $110,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund.
