    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to modify the contract with AmeriNational Community Services, LLC for loan servicing to add $65,000.00 and to extend the contract for another year.\n \nAmeriNational services loans provided to small business, home owners, home builders, and multi-family unit builders funded by the city’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME), and the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) grants.\n \nCompetitive bids were solicited for this service through Vendor Services in 2011.  The 2011 Mortgage Loan Servicing RFP provided for four, two-year contract periods.  One firm responded and was selected (AmeriNational Community Services, LLC).  \n \nThe original procurement effort and contract, including most renewals, were managed by the Department of Finance and Management.  In 2019, the Department of Development took over ownership of the contract as the loans in the portfolio are held by the Department of Development.  Since taking over the contract, Development has begun the process of reviewing the loan portfolio.  Before the COVID-19 health emergency, the department intended to work diligently to review the portfolio and make it portable to a potential new vendor as the department had intended to advertise for new loan services in mid-2020.  Given that most of the files are paper files and we are uncertain when staff will be returning to the office, the portfolio review will take longer than anticipated, therefore advertisement for loan servicing may not occur until 2023.  Until such time the portfolio is reviewed and made portable to a new vendor, contract renewals for this service are needed.\n \nPrior contracts/renewals were authorized as follows:\nOrdinance 0139-2012                                          $185,000.00\nOrdinance 0112-2013                                          $120,000.00\nOrdinance 0146-2014                                          $120,000.00 \nOrdinance 0362-2015                                          $118,260.00\nOrdinance 0400-2016                                          $103,753.17\nOrdinance 0995-2017                                          $102,463.00\nOrdinance 0166-2018                                          $  80,000.00\nOrdinance 0218-2019                                          $  80,000.00\nOrdinance 1315-2020                                          $  95,000.00\nOrdinance 0993-2021                                          $  61,000.00\n \nThe total compensation for all authorized parts of prior renewals, modifications, and this modification ($65,000.00) results in a total contract amount of $1,130,476.17\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe total amount to be authorized for this contract modification is $65,000.00.  Funds are available in the Department of Development, Division of Housing, 2022 General Fund budget.  \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify the contract with AmeriNational Community Services, LLC for loan servicing by adding $65,000.00, updating the scope of services as needed, and extending the contract end date; to authorize the expenditure of up to $65,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($65,000.00)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Development desires to modify the contract with AmeriNational Community Services, LLC for loan servicing to add $65,000.00, to update the scope of services as needed, and to extend the contract end date another year; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify this contract so that program services continue without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to modify the contract with AmeriNational Community Services, LLC for loan servicing to add $65,000.00, update the scope of services as needed, and to extend the contract end date for another year.   \n \nSECTION 2.                     That the expenditure of $65,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-10 (Housing), in Object Class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.                     Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
