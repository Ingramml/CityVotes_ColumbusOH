    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $3,700.00 in grant monies to fund the SFY 2022 - 2023 Mosquito Control grant program, for the period April 11, 2022 through April 30, 2023.  \n \nThe SFY 2022 - 2023 Mosquito Control grant program will fund the purchase of a RAMP WNV Test Reader.  The test reader will be utilized for surveillance of the West Nile Virus presence in our community. Staff will then be able to respond quickly to perform adult mosquito control, larval control and breeding source reduction around the trapping location. In addition to responding quickly, more accurate testing will reduce unnecessary use of resources due to false positives determined from in house testing.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the city's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The SFY 2022 - 2023 Mosquito Control grant program is funded entirely by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, not to exceed a total award amount of $3,700.00.
