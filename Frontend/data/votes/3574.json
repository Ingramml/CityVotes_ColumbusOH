    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Harmony Project in support of Finding Harmony Week, Public Art Murals, and the Cleaner Columbus Initiative.\n \nHarmony Project was formed in 2009 with the mission of building a stronger and more inclusive community through the arts and volunteer services. The Harmony Project has programs serving differently-abled adults; men and women who have experienced homelessness; students from across the economic spectrum, yet predominantly from low income households; women and men serving time; veterans, and restored citizens. Additionally, the Harmony Project completes over 60,000 volunteer hours a year. \n \nEvery year, the Harmony Project hosts Finding Harmony Week. This year Harmony volunteers will kick off Finding Harmony Week by participating in the Cleaner Columbus community-wide clean up. The Harmony Project will provide a minimum of 200 volunteers focused on cleanup efforts in the Northland community. Harmony has worked in the Northland neighborhood many times over the past decade, including most recently with a Columbus Parks and Recreation Center, Columbus City Schools, and Global Academy. Finding Harmony Week will also include the creation of Public Art Murals in Franklinton, Linden, Northland, and South Columbus. \n \nRecognizing the increase in litter and debris throughout the city of Columbus neighborhoods, it is imperative that we engage Columbus residents as often as possible during our efforts to create a cleaner Columbus. Cleaner Columbus will be hosting a city-wide litter cleanup on April 30th to further this effort. \n \n \nFiscal impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund and the citywide transfer line for an amount up to $100,000.00.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in delivery of services to mitigate litter in Columbus.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Harmony Project in support of Finding Harmony Week, Public Art Murals, and the Cleaner Columbus Initiative; to authorize a transfer and expenditure within the general fund; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.

That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $50,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund to the Department of Development per the accounting code in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared an emergency measure and shall take effect and be enforced from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
