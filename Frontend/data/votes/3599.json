    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to execute a planned modification to the 2020 - 2022 Construction Administration/Inspection (CA/CI) Services agreement with DLZ Ohio, Inc.\n \nFunding for this modification will be for the following Department projects:  \n \n•                     Moler Street Overflow Intercepting Sewer, CIP No. 650763-100000 (DOSD), Planning Area = 63 - Southside, $1,218,978.99\n•    Moler Street Area Waterline Improvements, CIP No. 690236-100151 (DOW), Planning Area = 63 - Southside, $24,700.30\n•                     ODOT FRA-70.22.61 12\" Water Main Relocation, CIP No. 690549-100014 (DOW), Planning Area = 58 - Far East, $79,759.28\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,323,438.57\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $1,227,027.50                     PO218447, PO218448/ PO235997, PO218450, PO218451, PO218452\nModification 1                     $     54,610.00                     PO228293\nModification 2                     $   668,555.17                     PO238163\nModification 3                     $     66,002.17                     PO253702\nModification 4                     $1,335,502.54                     PO266814 \nModification 5                     $   328,804.02                     PO272171, PO272160, PO272174, PO272176, PO272177\nModification 6                     $   697,932.58                     PO277886, PO277880, PO277882\nModification 7                     $   997,459.48                     PO315698\nModification 8 (current)                     $1,243,679.29\nTotal (Orig. + Mods)                                     $6,703,113.81\n                                                               \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2020 - 2022 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 0052-2020.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multiyear contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration / inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2020-2022) timeframe.    \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nCost proposals were provided by DLZ Ohio, Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and the Division of Water and deemed acceptable.\n \n2.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe Department of Public Utilities does not have the resources to perform all of the duties necessary to administer and inspect construction of said projects; DLZ Ohio, Inc. will perform the services.\n \nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage projects include rehabilitation of existing sewers, repair to existing sewers, construction of new sewers, and construction of green infrastructure.  The majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues.\n \nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency and valves that are inoperable.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss. The Neighborhood Liaison(s) will be contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \n3.0 FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  The Department anticipates requesting additional future modifications to this contract as new construction projects begin during 2022.\n \n4.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  There are sufficient funds within the Water General Obligations Fund - 6006 for both projects.  A transfer of funds within the Sanitary General Obligations Fund - 6109 will be necessary, as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to execute a planned modification to the 2020-2022 Construction Administration/Inspection Services Agreement with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the joint Division of Sewerage and Drainage/Water Moler Street Overflow Intercepting Sewer/Water Line Relocation Project, and for the Division of Water’s 12\" Water Main Relocation Project, to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $1,218,978.99 within the Sanitary General Obligations Fund;
