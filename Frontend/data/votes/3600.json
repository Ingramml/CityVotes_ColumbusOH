    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Intelex Technologies for the purpose of software support and upgrade services. Intelex is a system used by the Regulatory Compliance Section and Divisions at the Department of Public Utilities to track documents and keep work-flow compliant. The Intelex system is a third party, vendor-hosted software and the code cannot be modified by City Staff.  Intelex will need to be upgraded in the future and an annual subscription fee will be paid to use the software. In order to keep the technology solution current, the Department of Public Utilities will need to contract with Intelex Technologies to transition from the Intelex v5 platform to the v6 platform in Intelex’s hosted environment. \n \nIntelex Technologies is the recommended vendor to complete this upgrade. They provide the software and existing software support. They are in the best position to provide the Department of Public Utilities with services for the upgrade project. \n \nThis original contract was established for one (1) year from the date of execution. This ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the City Code pertaining to the waiver of competitive bidding.

Reason other procurement processes were not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original contract.  No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.
