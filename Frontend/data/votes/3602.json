    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Ribway Engineering Group, Inc. for the Dublin Road Water Plant Miscellaneous Improvements - Basin Clarifier Rehabilitation Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690278-100005, Division of Water Contract No. 2199.\n \nThe project includes field inspection / condition assessment and design for clarifier improvements for basins 1, 2, and 3.  Improvements in each basin will include the replacement of four clarifier drive mechanisms, replacement of corner sweep mechanisms, rehab of clarifier rake arms, and replacement of misc. piping, supports, electrical equipment/conduits, and other clarifier appurtenances.  Additionally, flocculation basin 1, 2, 3 and 4 drive mechanisms and associated electrical conduits will be replaced.  \n \nWork performed to date includes field inspection/condition assessment, preliminary design services, detailed design services, and engineering services during construction. Detailed design services also included preparation of construction contract documents for the improvements recommended in the Preliminary Design Report (PDR).\n \n*Funding under this ordinance was changed from a Renewal to a Modification due to clarification from the City Attorney’s Office.\n \nThis contract modification (No. 3) will provide Final Engineering Services During Construction.  \n \nThe DRWP serves multiple planning areas so the planning area is “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $2,300,000.00\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $   556,700.00                     (PO107378)\nRenewal #1:                     $1,450,018.00                     (PO188716)\nRenewal #2:                     $1,400,000.00                     (PO256262)\nModification #3 (current):                     $2,300,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Rens/Mod.)                     $5,706,718.00\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis contract modification was anticipated and explained in the original contract and provided funding for Final Engineering Services During Construction. \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the engineering work to date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project and put the City at risk of not meeting water treatment goals due to aging infrastructure, equipment, and appurtenances.\n \n1.4. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the remainder of services during construction.  City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved these cost summaries.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This project will address the current risks associated with the aging assets in the water treatment basins including the clarification drive mechanisms and the flocculation drive mechanisms.  These assets are critical to the successful treatment of the drinking water at the DRWP.  All work will be conducted within the secure area of the water plant that is not accessible to the public, so no public meetings are anticipated.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  31-1406579, expires 10/31/24, MAJ, DAX No. 5279.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) produced no findings against Ribway Engineering Group, Inc.\n \nThe Findings for Recovery list (State) produced 1 finding against Ribway Engineering Group, Inc. on a project for the Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati in the amount of $91,706.00 on September 14, 2018.\n \n4. FUTURE RENEWAL/MODIFICATION(S):  This will be the last request for funding against this agreement.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT:  A transfer of funds within the Water PayGo Fund - Fund No. 6016 will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Ribway Engineering Group, Inc. for the Dublin Road Water Plant Miscellaneous Improvements - Basin Clarifier Rehabilitation Project; for the Division of Water; to authorize a transfer, appropriation, and expenditure up to $2,300,000.00 within the Water PayGo Fund; and to authorize an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.
