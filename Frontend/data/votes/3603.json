    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.                     BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (#3) an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007. The Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant creates large amounts of methane-rich digester biogas which is now burned in flares as a waste product.  A feasibility study showed that installing a cogeneration system can beneficially use this biogas as fuel to create electricity that will supply about half the total electricity the plant uses, with an acceptable payback period and significant overall reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The cogeneration system will be relatively large and complex.  This project also includes design work for replacing certain plant boilers at the end of their useful life and improvements to the CMT facilities. This renewal purchases the remaining step 3 services during construction. Construction is being accomplished by others under a separate contract.  \n \n                     The construction work will occur at the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant and has been designated as planning area 99, Citywide.\n \n1.1                     Amount of additional funds to be expended:                                          $1,907,793.00\nOriginal Contract                     $1,025,883.00\nModification No. 1                     $2,309,950.00\nModification No. 2                     $1,299,989.00\nModification No. 3 (current)                     $1,907,793.00\nCURRENT PROPOSED TOTAL                                                               $6,543,615.00\n \n1.2                     Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification/renewal.\n \n1.3                     Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant. In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \n1.4                     How cost of modification was determined:\nCosts were negotiated between the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and Arcadis US, Inc.\n \n2.                     PROJECT TIMELINE:  The Notice to Proceed for preliminary design was issued 8/22/2017.  That work was completed, and renewal 1 for detailed design issued NTP on 1/22/2019.  That work was completed and renewal 2, for phase 1 of step 3 services during construction, was issued NTP on 7/6/2021. This planned renewal for phase 2 of step 3 services will complete all engineering work and will progress through the duration of construction.  The separate construction project is underway and is expected to be completed by fourth quarter of 2023, and all engineering work will also be complete at that time.\n \n \n3.   EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is not requested at this time\n \n4.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE NO: 57-0373224| Exp. 3/18/2023 | DAX Vendor #009409\n \n5.   ECONOMIC / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  This project provides design work to install a cogeneration system that will use the facility’s biogas, now burned in flares as a waste product to create large amounts of electricity.  The updated lifecycle cost analysis from preliminary design show a savings in electrical costs, which helps to offset the capital and operating costs of the improvement.  A detailed feasibility study shows a large overall reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions.  The system will reduce overall greenhouse emissions by more than 4,000 tons a year of equivalent CO2. This project includes designing stormwater detention BMPs (Best Management Practices) and floodwater compensatory cut that is needed to meet previous stormwater commitments.  These improvements will help to protect the water quality of the Scioto River.\n \n6.   FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance requires the appropriation of, transfer within and the expenditure of up to $1,907,793.00 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116. It also authorizes an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget for the creation of sufficient authority for this project.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) Cogeneration Project; and to appropriate, transfer, and expend up to $1,907,793.00 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage. ($1,907,793.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Project with Arcadis was authorized by Ord 1329-2017; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract was modified (#1) by Ordinance 2924-2018; and \n \nWHEREAS, the original contract was modified (#2) by Ordinance 0926-2021; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify (#3) an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the appropriation, transfer, and the expenditure of up to $1,907,793.00 from the Sanitary Sewer PayGo Fund 6116; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget for purposes of creating and providing sufficient budget authority for the aforementioned expenditures; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify  an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007 for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1: That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. 100 E. Campus View Blvd., Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43235 for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Office of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\nSECTION 2.
