    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management Services (PCM) - 2018 Project.\n \nThe PCM assists the City with managing the capital improvement program consisting of multiple projects to ensure completion in accordance with design requirements and City’s needs, while serving as a liaison between the construction contractor, design professional (DP), and City personnel.  The PCM team furnishes all necessary competent personnel, equipment, and materials to perform the work, which will generally consist of program support services, design phase services, and construction management services.  Projects are assigned to this contract based on a two year assignment window.  Funds are authorized through annual contract renewals (or more frequent renewals if required by fiscal needs).  \n \nWork performed to date includes program support services, design phase services, and construction management services.  Future phases of the contact will continue program support services and construction management services.\n \nThis Renewal #5 will fund PCM services from June 2022 through May 2023.\n \nCommunity planning is “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \nFUTURE RENEWALS:  The PCM contract will provide construction services through completion of all assigned construction projects.  The estimated contract end date is August 1, 2025, but the actual end date will depend on the construction duration of the 690278-100005, DRWP Misc. Imp's - Basin Clarifier Rehab project.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $3,931,400.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:          $  2,644,800.00\nRenewal #1:                     $  5,082,200.00\nModification #2:                     $  5,603,300.00\nModification #3:                     $                0.00 (time extension only)\nRenewal #4:                     $  5,429,700.00\nRenewal #5 (current):                     $  3,931,400.00\nRenewals #6-7 (future):                     $  4,000,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Rens/Mods):                     $26,691,400.00\n \n*Funding for request #4, etc. changed from a Modification to Renewal based on clarification from the City Attorney’s Office.\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant has already provided both design phase and construction phase services for all the projects assigned to this contract.  Bidding this work out to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the work already performed and would interrupt construction phase services for projects currently under construction.  \n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe City identified the services that would be needed for each project over the renewal period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project and subsequently revised by consultant based on City’s comments.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This PCM contract will support various projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects will maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the central Ohio area.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nMost projects will be located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public and for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for projects that impact the public.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying DPU’s environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  20-0953973, expires 12/8/23, MAJ, DAX No. 0990\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hill International, Inc.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund - Fund No. 6006 will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management Services - 2018 Project; for the Division of Water; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $3,931,400.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.  ($3,931,400.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No’s PO135567, PO135569, PO135573, PO135602, PO135603, PO135611, PO135614, PO135616, PO135617, PO135618, PO135619, PO135621, PO135624, PO135627, PO135629, PO135631, PO135632, PO135633 were authorized by Ordinance No. 1962-2018, passed July 30, 2018, was executed on August 30, 2018, and approved by the City Attorney on September 13, 2018, for the Professional Construction Management Services - 2018 Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal No. 1, under Contract No’s PO188851, PO188853, PO188855, PO188856, PO188857, PO188858, PO188930, PO188938, PO188941, PO188945, PO188948, PO188950, PO188953, PO188958, PO188962, PO188966, PO188967, PO188970, PO188971, was authorized by Ordinance No. 1707-2019, passed July 22, 2019, was executed on August 22, 2019, and approved by the City Attorney on August 30, 2019 for the Professional Construction Management Services - 2018 Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Modification No. 2, under Contract No’s PO238223, PO238224, PO238225, PO238226, PO238229, PO238230, PO238231, PO238232, PO238233, PO238234, PO238235, PO238236, was authorized by Ordinance No. 1423-2020, passed July 20, 2020, was executed August 21, 2020, signed by the City Attorney on August 24, 2020, and continued funding for several projects and extended the contract assignment date from September 18, 2020 to December 18, 2020; and \n \nWHEREAS, Contract Modification No. 3 was authorized by Ordinance No. 2380-2020, passed November 16, 2020, was executed December 16, 2020, and extended the contract assignment date from December 18, 2020 to April 17, 2021; and\n \n*Funding for request #4, etc. changed from a Modification to Renewal based on clarification from the City Attorney’s Office.\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal No. 4, under Contract No’s PO276340, PO276342, PO276344, PO276348, PO276349, PO276350, PO276354, was authorized by Ordinance No. 0872-2021, passed May 10, 2021, was executed June 9, 2021, signed by the City Attorney on June 10, 2021, and continued funding for several projects and extended the contract assignment date from June 2021 through May 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract Renewal No. 5 (current) will fund PCM services from June 2022 through May 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc. for the Professional Construction Management Services - 2018 Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a transfer and expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
