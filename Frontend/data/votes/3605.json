    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Court technology operations are currently being handled by the Franklin County Clerk of Court’s Office of Information Services (OIS) Department with a few exceptions. The need for technology has substantially increased over time. The Court has experienced growth of staff, programs, changes to operating procedures due to the pandemic, and the need to become compliant with new technology standards set by the Ohio Supreme Court. Additionally, the newly proposed Court building will require significant  technology planning and investment to ensure that construction incorporates appropriate technology functions and features. Among many other changes in process and procedure, the Court is moving toward a paperless environment, making the importance of current, reliable, and up-to-date technology and the support of that technology essential to Court operations. All of these reasons support the Court’s critical need to establish an onsite technology staff who will be responsible for managing hardware and software to be self-sufficient from a technology standpoint. \nEMERGENCY ACTION:  This ordinance is submitted as an emergency so that needed investments in IT infrastructure can commence without delay.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the transfer of $1,107,019.35 between departments within the General Fund; from the Department of Finance and Management to the Franklin County Municipal Court, as well as the Department of Technology Information Services Fund (5100), and Department of Finance and Management’s Citywide Technology for the following expenses:\n01-Personnel-FCMC: $220,470.72\n02-Equipment-FCMC: $21,000.00\n03-Services-FCMC: $207,252.73\n03-Services-Finance (Citywide Technology - Indirect Technology Services): $483,638.00\n06-Capital-DoT (Purchase and maintenance of switches): $174,657.90\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the transfer of $448,723.45 between departments within the General Fund from the Department of Finance and Management to the Franklin County Municipal Court; to authorize the transfer of $483,638.00 between divisions within the General Fund from Department of Finance and Management, Financial Management Division to the Finance and Management Citywide Technology Division; to authorize the transfer of $174,657.90 between departments from the Department of Finance General Fund to the Department of Technology Information Services Fund, to authorize the appropriation of $483,638.00 within the Department of Technology Information Services Fund, to authorize the appropriation of $174,657.90 within the Department of Technology Information Services Fund; and to declare an emergency.
