    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 1613-2020, passed July 27, 2020, authorized the City of Columbus (“CITY”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Pinchal & Company LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), for a real property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of approximately $29,680,750, which included $26 million in real property improvements, and the creation of 20 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $624,000 related to the construction of a new approximately 583,740 square-foot speculative industrial distribution and warehouse facility (the “PROJECT”) on approximately 87.230 acres +/- of undeveloped land located at 1594 London Groveport Road,  parcel number 495-232641 within the City of Columbus and within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”).  The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective November 10, 2020 with the PROJECT expected to begin approximately November 2020, with all real property improvements expected to be completed by approximately December 2021 and with the abatement to commence no later than 2022 nor extend beyond 2031 (Agreement No. 023-20-06).\n \nAs of this date there has not been a filing of the DTE-24 with the Franklin County Auditor, no Final Determination from the Ohio Department of Taxation, and so no forgone tax benefit has yet been received.\n \nParagraph fourteen within Section 6 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY” and paragraph fifteen of that same section states that “any requested amendment…to any of the terms of the AGREEMENT…shall require the payment to the CITY by the ENTERPRISE of an AMENDMENT FEE in the amount of five-hundred dollars ($500.00).”\n \nIn a letter from London Groveport STS, LLC on behalf of the ENTERPRISE dated March 7, 2022, received by the CITY and through ensuing correspondence, London Groveport STS, LLC confirmed that they had acquired ownership of the PROJECT SITE from ENTERPRISE on May 05, 2021, with the transfer having been recorded at the County Auditor’s Office on May 12, 2021.  In addition, the PROJECT SITE has been revised to be Parcel Number 495-302542 London Groveport Road (legal description per the Franklin County Auditor as 1594 Lockbourne Road, R22 T3 S2-2, 42.205 acres) with the current street address 1595 London Groveport Road but that this street address may or may not change upon PROJECT completion. Due diligence has been undertaken by the CITY in that London Groveport STS, LLC has agreed to fully assume the terms and commitments of the ENTERPRISE pursuant to the AGREEMENT, has submitted an updated Economic Development Incentive Application, the five-hundred dollars ($500.00) Amendment Fee and that this application and all other pertinent information has been reviewed and vetted.\n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to (1) remove Pinchal & Company LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with London Groveport STS, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, whereby London Groveport STS, LLC will assume the terms and commitments of the AGREEMENT, (2) revise the description of the PROJECT SITE (3) revise the notice information related to ENTERPRISE within Section 6 of the AGREEMENT, and (4) to correct the job creation and commensurate payroll commitments in Section 2 of the AGREEMENT. \n \nThis legislation is being presented as an emergency measure in order for this amendment to be legislated in as expedient a manner as possible so that this amendment to the AGREEMENT might be fully executed with the proper property owner, which will allow the ENTERPRISE to remain in compliance and receive any future tax savings from the proposed abatement.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement for a the first time for Assignment & Assumption with London Groveport STS, LLC, to remove Pinchal & Company LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with London Groveport STS, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, to redefine the PROJECT SITE, revise the notice information, revise the jobs creation and commensurate payroll commitments, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS,                     the City of Columbus (“CITY”) entered into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Pinchal & Company LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), approved by Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”) by Ordinance No. 1613-2020, passed July 27, 2020, with this AGREEMENT made and entered into effective November 10, 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     the AGREEMENT granted a 75%/10-Year abatement on real property improvements; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     the incentive was granted in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of approximately $29,680,750, which included $26 million in real property improvements, and the creation of 20 net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $624,000 related to the construction of a new approximately 583,740 square foot speculative industrial distribution and warehouse facility (the “PROJECT”) on approximately  87.230 acres +/- of undeveloped land located at 1594 London Groveport Road,  parcel umber 495-232641 within the City of Columbus and within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”).  The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective November 10, 2020 with the PROJECT expected to begin approximately November 2020, with all real property improvements expected to be completed by approximately December 2021 and with the abatement to commence no later than 2022 nor extend beyond 2031 (Agreement No. 023-20-06); and\n \nWHEREAS,                     as of this date there has not been a filing of the DTE-24 with the Franklin County Auditor, no Final Determination from the Ohio Department of Taxation, and so no forgone tax benefit has yet been received; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     paragraph fourteen within Section 6 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY” and paragraph fifteen of that same section states that “any requested amendment…to any of the terms of the AGREEMENT…shall require the payment to the CITY by the ENTERPRISE of an AMENDMENT FEE in the amount of five-hundred dollars ($500.00);” and\n \nWHEREAS,                     in a letter from London Groveport STS, LLC on behalf of the ENTERPRISE dated March 7, 2022, received by the CITY and through ensuing correspondence, London Groveport STS, LLC confirmed that they had acquired ownership of the PROJECT SITE from ENTERPRISE on May 05, 2021, with the transfer having been recorded at the County Auditor’s Office on May 12, 2021.
