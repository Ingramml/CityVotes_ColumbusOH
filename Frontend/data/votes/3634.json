    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Parking Meter Payment Systems with Parkeon/Flowbird.  This contract provides for the Division of Parking Services single space, double space and multi-space kiosk parking meter systems that collect parking fees in designated pay to park areas throughout the City of Columbus. This modification is necessary due to global supply chain issues with material availability for production and will ensure the delivery and installation schedule. The contract, PO304322 was established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ019118 and will expire December 31, 2026.\n \nNo additional funds are necessary to modify the option contract as requested. Modification # 1: Due to supply chain issues on materials, there is a product change in the outer shell (housing) of the multi-unit kiosk systems (qty 160) that are currently on order. The housing units will be refurbished instead of new; the outer shells have no effect on the function or effectiveness of the parking meter system as all interior parts are new.  The vendor, Flowbird, has offered as an acceptance of this change, an additional one (1) year extended warranty at no charge for the 160 units. This will save the City of Columbus an estimated $52,000.00 in costs by not purchasing this additional warranty. Modification #2: Section 3.5.7 Completion of Installation: Should installation and acceptance not be completed by April 30, 2022, or at a 75% installed completion the contract will result in a liquidated damages charge of $750.00 per day. The modification is to update the Completion of Installation: The City will issue a Notice to Proceed (NTP) letter stating the date installation can commence and a new date for installation. This date will be mutually agreed upon by the City and Flowbird and will be determined at a later date. The liquidated damages clause will remain the same terms but based on a new installation date. The original contract was formally bid on RFQ019118.  The additional original terms and conditions remain in effect. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation to be considered an emergency because the delivery schedule of the kiosk meters is pertinent to the installation of new units throughout the City.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contract.  The Department of Public Service must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the contract for the option to purchase Parking Meter Payment Systems with Parkeon/Flowbird; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into a Universal Term Contract for Parking Meter Payment Systems for use by the Division of Parking Services; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing Universal Term Contract with Parkeon/Flowbird, to include refurbished multi-space kiosk housing units and update the section 3.5.7 Completion of Installation; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify a Universal Term Contract with Parkeon/Flowbird to ensure on time delivery of product for installation of new meters throughout the City, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify the contract for option to obtain Parking Meter Payment Systems with Parkeon/Flowbird.\n \nSECTION 2. That this modification is in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
