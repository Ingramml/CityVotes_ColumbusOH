    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 and the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Discovery Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. in an amount up to $1,000,000.00.\n \nIn 2003 the Discovery District Development Corporation asked Capitol South Community Urban Redevelopment Corporation to initiate an effort to work with Discovery District property owners to create a Special Improvement District (SID) on the east side of downtown. Property owners were surveyed and overwhelmingly were in support of seeing a proposal to create a SID. The SID was created for an initial five year period, was very successful and reauthorized in 2010 and again in 2015.  \n \nIn 2020, a one petition process was initiated in which property owners representing at least 60% of the front feet within the District signed that they were interested in reauthorizing the SID and they approved of the Plan for Services delineating the services to be provided by the SID.  The petition was accepted and approved by Columbus City Council’s Ordinance No. 0808-2020, passed May 4, 2020. \n \nSubsequently, two additional Resolutions were approved by the City Council; 0068X-2020 on May 18, 2020 and 0101X-2020 on June 29, 2020.  The final action as required by Chapter 1710 of the Ohio Revised code to reauthorize the SID, Ordinance 1893-2020, was approved by the City Council on September 14, 2020. Each assessment is to be returned to the SID for operational requirements as set forth in the Plan for Services.\n \nThis legislation disburses assessments to be collected in fiscal year 2021 to be returned to the SID. \n \nEmergency action is requested to continue services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this expenditure will be received from the levy of assessments to be collected from property owners in the Discovery Special Improvement District. These funds are deposited into and expended from Discovery SID Fund (Fund 3310).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  This vendor’s vendor number is 001286 and is valid until 2/20/22.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 from the Discovery SID fund; authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract with the Discovery Special Improvement District of Columbus in an amount up to $1,000,000.00; and to declare an emergency. ($1,000,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council approved in 2020 the reauthorization and implementation of a plan for services for the Discovery Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. for a period of 5 years from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council has also levied assessments in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 1710 for such purposes, which funds are in the process of collection and are required by law to be distributed to the District by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the assessment funds collected by the County and forwarded to the City for disbursement will be available in March 2021 and September 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development, Economic Development Division, in that it is immediately necessary to appropriate and expend said funds to allow for continuation of services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
