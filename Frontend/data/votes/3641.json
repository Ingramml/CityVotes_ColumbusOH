    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Oberlander’s Tree & Landscape for the Glenwood Bottoms and Ulry Warner Tree Clearing Project. The contract amount is $75,700.00, with a contingency of $15,000.00, for a total of $90,700.00 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance. \n \nGlenwood Park is located at 1888 Fairmont Avenue in the City of Columbus, Ohio and consists of 16.7 acres in a west central location of the City. The park contains approximately 8.7 acres of developed land, including a recreational facility and swimming pool, and approximately 8.0 acres of undeveloped wooded terrain. This eight acre undeveloped area will be advanced by including a nature trail, wetland enhancements, signage, and amenities, including items such as benches and trash cans. Park boundaries will be also be established. Street frontage and overall aesthetics will be improved as well. \n \nThis contract will remove dead, dying, and diseased trees from the area in preparation for this construction project, which is scheduled for this fall. Neighborhood volunteer groups, including the Friends of Glenwood Park and the Highland West Civic Association, have partnered with the City to remove invasive species, trees that are no longer viable, and litter. These efforts reflect the Hilltop Community’s desire to revitalize this underutilized acreage of Glenwood Park. The overarching goal with improving Glenwood Park includes creating more access, improving the line of sight, and enhancing overall site safety for the community. At the Ulry Warner location, located at 4787 Central College Road, a 0.75 acre of small diameter trees are being removed in preparation for a park development project scheduled to start construction this summer. This site, in the far north east area of the city, was acquired for a future community park that will serve thousands of residents in one of the City’s fastest growing communities.  \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were originally advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on February 8, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 1, 2022.
