    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities (DPU) to enter into a contract modification to extend the construction contract with Phinney Industrial Roofing for roofing maintenance services at Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) facilities (FEM 0701.1). The work under this contract involves roofing and any associated systems that require inspection, testing, troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair or replacement. The contract also covers documentation or semi-annual inspections and warranty work, as needed or requested.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities publicly opened four (4) bids on February 21, 2018. Phinney Industrial Roofing was deemed to be the lowest, best, most responsive, and responsible bidder.  \n \nThe original contract, PO118807, established in accordance with Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to construction contracts and authorized under Ordinance Number 0858-2018, ran through June 10, 2019 and allowed for an additional three (3) one-year terms subject to mutual agreement, availability of funding and approval of City Council. The City and the vendor have executed each of the three anticipated renewals, with the current contract expiring June 10, 2022. Unforeseen issues or difficulties would require a modification.\n \nThis proposed modification #1 is for an unplanned fifth year of the contract in response to unforeseen issues in advertising new bids. The modification will extend the contract through September 30, 2022 and requires no additional funding.\n \nDOSD and the vendor developed a plan to rehabilitate several DOSD facility roofs with recent warranty expirations. The roofs at the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant centrifuge dewatering building and the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant raw sewage pump building were identified as roofs that could be rehabilitated at a fraction of the cost of a complete replacement. These two roofs would be rehabilitated and issued a new 10-year warranty. The roof rehabilitation at the Jackson Pike facility is complete, while the contract modification and extension will allow the process to finish at the Southerly facility, in addition to accounting for any needed repairs until the contract is re-bid.\n \nThis ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications/renewals.\n \n1. Amount of additional funds:  No additional funds are needed for this contract modification #1. Total contract amount is $858,000.00.\n \n2. Reasons additional funds were not foreseen:  N/A\n \n3. Reason other procurement processes were not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract. The additional unplanned year of the contract is due to unforeseen issues advertising new bids.\n \n4. How cost was determined:  The cost, terms and conditions are in accordance with the original agreement.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nPhinney Industrial Roofing, federal EIN 34-1478040, D365 Vendor #006672, expires 05/14/2022. Phinney Industrial Roofing does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$0.00\n \n$39,009.19 has been spent in 2022\n$107,360.35 was spent in 2021\n$95,913.37 was spent in 2020\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Phinney Industrial Roofing for roofing maintenance services at Division of Sewerage and Drainage facilities.
