    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the City of Columbus, Department of Development to accept and execute a reimbursable Heathy Homes Production Grant in an amount up to $2,000,000.00 from the Office of Lead Hazzard Control and Healthy Homes in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grant will be utilized by the Department of Development and Columbus Public Health.  Per current negotiations with HUD, pre-award expenditures are authorized starting April 18, 2022. The grant agreement may be executed as early as mid-May 2022 and the grant is for 42 months.\n \nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded nearly $104.7 million to 60 non-profit organizations, and state and local government agencies located in 29 states to protect children and families from home health hazards.  HUD is providing these grants through its Healthy Homes Production Grant Program which will help grantees identify health and safety hazards in low-income families’ homes. The grants will protect children and families with incomes at or below eighty percent of the area median income level by targeting significant lead and health hazards in over 7,400 low-income homes for which other resources are not available.  The Healthy Homes Production Grant Program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD’s successful Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department’s efforts to holistically address a variety of high-priority housing-based health and safety hazards, such as mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, pests, carbon monoxide, injury and safety hazards, in addition to lead-based paint. \n \nThis legislation is submitted as an emergency to allow the program’s full activities to begin the day the grant is effective.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation requests the appropriation of $2,000,000.00 from the General Government Grant Fund (Fund 2220), G442200.  \n \n$1,934,015.00 of the grant is appropriated in the Department of Development, of which $632,134.36 is appropriated for personnel costs and $1,301,880.64 is appropriated and to be expended for goods and services.  Of the $1,301,880.64, $1,192,500.00 shall be put on an auditor’s certificate with the remainder available in the budget.\n \n$65,985.00 of the grant is appropriated and to be expended by Columbus Public Health, all for services.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City of Columbus, Department of Development to accept and executed a reimbursable grant agreement of up to $2,000,000.00 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); to authorize the appropriation of $1,934,015.00 and expenditure of $1,192,500.00 by the Director of the Department of Development in the General Governmental Grant fund; to authorize the appropriation of $65,985.00 by the Health Commissioner of Columbus Public Health in the General Government Grant fund; to authorize the expenditure of pre-award costs effective April 18, 2022, and all funds the effective date of the grant; and to declare an emergency.
