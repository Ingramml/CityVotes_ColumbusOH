    "description": "Title\nTo honor and recognize May 2022 as National Foster Care Month in Columbus, Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in May 1988, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the first National Foster Care Month in the United States. The original focus was to give foster parents the recognition they deserved for opening their homes to foster children in need and caring for them; and\n \nWHEREAS, the theme of the Children’s Bureau’s National Foster Care Month campaign centers around strengthening relative and kin connections and the positive impact these relationships have on maintaining family and cultural ties for children and youth in foster care; and\n \nWHEREAS, an increased emphasis on prevention and reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of children that are forced to remain in the foster care system; and\n \nWHEREAS, with many children in need of safe and loving homes, Columbus City Council thanks all foster parents who have already answered the call; and\n \nWHEREAS, the commitment to ensuring that all youth in foster care have the love, support, and resources they need to thrive is one that Columbus City Council recognizes; and \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council appreciates the tireless work of all foster parents and urges those interested in learning more about fostering to consider becoming a foster parent as soon as possible; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby honor and recognize the month of May 2022 as National Foster Care Month and expresses gratitude to all foster parents in Columbus, Ohio.",
