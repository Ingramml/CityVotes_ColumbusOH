    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio for design of the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - E. Broad Street Widening project in an amount up to $199,778.56.\nOrdinance 1454-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - E. Broad Street Widening project in an amount of up to $1,400,000.00.  This contract was issued to design improvements to the East Broad Street Corridor from I-270 to Outerbelt Street.  The $1,400,000.00 approved in Ordinance 1454-2017 was the amount estimated to be needed to complete preliminary and final engineering for the project.  The original contract amount was issued for $406,826.72, the amount needed to complete preliminary engineering for the project.\nOrdinance 1872-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $20,000.00.  This was an unplanned modification that was necessary to cover the cost of additional work needed on the project due to a hotel that was announced to be built within the project corridor.  Additional traffic studies were needed to determine appropriate access management for the hotel.  These studies were not included in the original scope of work for the project.  \nOrdinance 1174-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,498,173.28.  This was a planned modification that was necessary to perform final engineering to complete detailed design for the project.  \nThis ordinance is an planned modification that is necessary to include: 1) additional research into an existing AT&T duct bank along E. Broad Street and preliminary studies into possible resolutions as well as 2) additional work associated with the final right of way plans, additional lighting, pedestrian signals, and drive profiles.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract to have the company familiar with the project complete the design work rather than to bid this unplanned part of the work.\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $406,826.72     (PO080529, Ord. 1454-2017)  \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                   $20,000.00     (PO225869, Ord. 1872-2019)  \nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                           $1,498,173.28     (PO227935, Ord. 1174-2020)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                 $199,778.56                          (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:          $2,124,778.56  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against TranSystems Corporation of Ohio. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for TranSystems Corporation of Ohio is CC007988 and expires 4/14/2024.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this project are available in Fund 7431 (E. Broad Commercial TIF Capital Fund).  Funds will need to be transferred between projects within Fund 7431 and then appropriated for expenditure.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow these safety enhancements to be available for the traveling public at the earliest possible time.\n \nTitle\nTo transfer cash and appropriate funds within the East Broad Commercial TIF Capital Fund 7431; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with TranSystems Corporation of Ohio in connection with the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - East Broad Street Widening project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $199,778.56 for the contract modification from the East Broad Commercial TIF Capital Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($199,778.56) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is engaged in the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - E.
