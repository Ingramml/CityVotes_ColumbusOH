    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP) Caustic Feed Improvements Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690578-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2208.\n \nThis is a contract for Professional Engineering Services (Design Professional or “DP” services) for the DRWP Caustic Feed Improvements project (CIP 690578-100000). The project includes evaluation and design for caustic feed improvements at the Dublin Road Water Plant located at 940 Dublin Road, Columbus, Ohio 43215. \n \nThe improvements will provide storage and feed capabilities to deliver liquid caustic soda (i.e., sodium hydroxide) to multiple post filtration application points for pH adjustment of the filtered water. Improvements will include, but not be limited to, bulk storage, day tank storage, flow metering, piping, valving, electrical, and instrumentation and controls. \n \nWork performed to date includes preliminary design services.  \n \nModification No. 1 (current) will provide for detailed design and bidding services.  Engineering services during construction will be provided under a future contract modification.\n \nThe improvements are directly related to the DRWP treatment process, which services multiple community planning areas (Planning Area - 99 Citywide).\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $442,220.00\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $233,659.00                     (PO232980)  \nModification No. 1 (current):                     $442,220.00 \nTotal (Orig. + Mod 1):                     $675,879.00 \n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis modification was described and was anticipated in the original contract as a future modification.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the work to date on the current design path.  Bidding the work to another consultant will delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project and put the City at risk of not meeting water treatment goals.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the remainder of services during construction.  City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved these cost summaries.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This project will improve the Dublin Road Water Treatment Plant’s ability to adjust finished water pH prior to distribution. This project is part of the City’s ongoing efforts to maintain a safe and reliable supply of drinking water to its customers.  There will be no anticipated public meetings held during this project. The Division of Water will be responsible for coordinating with stakeholders.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  57-0373224, expires 2/9/24, MAJ, DAX No. 4425\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Burgess & Niple, Inc.\n \n4. FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  A future modification will be needed for engineering services during construction.\n \n5.
