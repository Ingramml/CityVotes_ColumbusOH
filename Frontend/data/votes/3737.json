    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to a high-quality prekindergarten education for every 4-year-old.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nChildren who participate in high-quality prekindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills.  Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate. \n \nThe purpose of Early Start Columbus is to expand high-quality prekindergarten services through partnerships with Columbus City Schools and community-based providers.  The providers partnering in the Early Start Columbus Program have all demonstrated their ability to provide a high-quality prekindergarten education.  All partnering providers are rated at least three stars in the State’s Step Up To Quality rating and improvement system.  \n \nState law makes allowable the braiding of Ohio Department of Education Early Childhood Expansion funds with those of the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Service Publicly Funded Childcare program.  The 2021-2022 Early Start Columbus Program combines Office of Education funds with these funding streams to further extend the number of children served while using City funds more efficiently.  This approach uses City funds as “last dollar” funding. \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $1,295,550.50 from the 2022 Office of Education’s General Fund operating budget.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNTION: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the contracts are enacted to meet the operational needs of the providers.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of the Office of Education to enter into renewal contracts for the 2021-2022 fourth payment with high-quality prekindergarten organizations that provide educational services; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,295,550.50 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,295,550.50)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Education desires to enter into renewal contracts for the 2021-2022 fourth payment with various high-quality prekindergarten organizations that provide educational services and quality prekindergarten services to Columbus 4-year-olds to prepare them for kindergarten; and \n \nWHEREAS, research shows that quality pre-kindergarten instruction provides meaningful value to children’s educational performance and preparation for school; and\n \nWHEREAS, the goal is that all children in City of Columbus will be kindergarten ready; and \n \nWHEREAS, funding was budgeted in the general fund within the Office of Education’s operating budget for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into renewal contracts to meet the operational needs of the Early Start Columbus providers; now, therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
