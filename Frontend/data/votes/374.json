($40,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes a second modification of an existing contract with AED Advisers in the amount of $40,000. In May 2020, the City Auditor’s Office - Division of Income Tax, through the utilization of a Request for Proposals process (RFP015616) received (4) responses for professional services related to the Division’s compliance with IRS Publication 1075. In July 2020, the Division established a contract with AED Advisers for $20,000.00 via PO232096 to perform a thorough evaluation of the Division’s current safeguarding policies and practices in anticipation of the pending IRS on-site review. A first modification was done in September 2020 (PO241952) to extend the professional services and increase the contract amount by $67,200.  AED Advisers reviewed existing documentation, conducted interviews with key Division and Department of Technology personnel, and assisted with preparation of IRS deliverables. It has been determined that there is still a need for additional professional services to fully evaluate the division’s needs and assist with extended timelines for IRS reports and submissions.\n \nThis ordinance represents modification #2 to include additional funding for an extended assessment period and an implementation period. This 2nd modification is needed to support extended timelines for IRS submissions and onsite reviews as well as internal inspection periods and managing ongoing compliance requirements. The total cost of this modification is $40,000 with a contract term of one year, commencing on July 1, 2020 and ending on June 30, 2021. This modification is critical to the success of this on-going project, which is being undertaken to ensure that the City’s safeguarding practices for federal tax information meet and exceed regulatory requirements.\n \n1. Amount of additional funds to be expended: $40,000.00\nOriginal contract amount (PO232096):                                                       $20,000.00\nAmount of modification   (1943-2020)                             $67,200.00\nAmount of modification   (0470-2021)                             $40,000.00\nTotal aggregate contract:                                                                            $127,200.00\n \n2. Reason additional goods/services could not be foreseen\nThis modification is needed to support further evaluation of the Division’s needs and assist with extended timelines for key IRS deliverables. It was not known at the outset of the project how many hours would be needed to complete preparation phases of the project.It is also expected that more time and resources will need to be dedicated to managing ongoing requirements than initially expected .  \n \n3. Reason other procurement processes are not used\nIt is not feasible to bid for an alternate service since AED Advisers initiated the project. To change providers in the middle would disrupt the project.\n \n4. How cost of modification was determined\nAED Advisers provided the Income Tax Division with a cost proposal for this renewal and phase of the project with project staff hourly rates.\n \nEMERGENCY:\nEmergency action is requested to expedite authorization of this contract in order to facilitate and maintain uninterrupted services from the supplier and so that these funds be made available at the earliest possible date and the project continues without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThis ordinance authorizes modification #2 of the original contract for an additional $40,000.00 for the continuation of professional services. These funds are budgeted and available in the Income Tax Division’s 2021 operating budget for this purpose.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER:\nVendor: AED Advisers, LLC CC#: 33027 Expiration Date: 7/8/2022\n(DAX Vendor Account #: 033027)\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to amend a contract with AED Advisers, LLC for the continuation of professional services associated with the review of existing policies and procedures supporting the City’s compliance with IRS Publication 1075; to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the Income Tax Division operating fund; and to declare an emergency.
