    "description": "BACKGROUND: \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\nDue to the effects of COVID-19, the City of Columbus recognizes many organizations providing summer employment opportunities may not have the capacity to do so in 2022. \n \nThrough the American Rescue Plan, up to $1,915,688 $1,865,688 is allocated to distribute to qualified Columbus area nonprofit agencies. Agreements will be issued to the following non-profits organizations: African American Male Wellness Walk, Columbus Fashion Alliance, The Columbus Urban League, Heart of JOB Foundation, Image-Character-Etiquette, Kingdom First, Legacy Youth Sports Academy, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, New Birth Christian Ministries, The Ohio State University and Urban Foundation on behalf of Warhol &Wall St.  The nonprofit organizations will serve at-risk boys and young men of color between the ages of 14-24 to help ease the challenges families face due to the current public health emergency.
