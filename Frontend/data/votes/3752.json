    "description": "Title\nTo Honor and Recognize May 25th as Africa Day in Columbus\n \nBody\nWHEREAS,                      the ongoing significance and many contributions of Africans in our cultural, social, and political development deserves recognition; and\n \nWHEREAS,                      Africa Day, also known as African Unity Day, is celebrated annually on May 25. It commemorates the founding of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the precursor to the African Union (AU), on this day in 1963; and\n \nWHEREAS,                      the celebration of Africa Day represents an opportunity to acknowledge a diverse and important group of people from 50 African countries, who enrich and make valuable contributions to Central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS,                      the African Union called for greater unity among African countries. The African Union supported the independence of African countries from colonialism and apartheid and promoted economic and political cooperation with a vision that all people on the continent would live freely and in prosperity; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     today, the vision remains the same as in 1963: for Africa to achieve inclusive and sustainable development with the goal to unite communities and ensure the welfare and wellbeing of all Africans; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     this Council acknowledges Africa Day as a customary annual marker of the liberation movement's development, and as a symbol of Africa's commitment to be free of foreign dominance and exploitation; therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby Honor and Recognize May 25th as Africa Day.",
