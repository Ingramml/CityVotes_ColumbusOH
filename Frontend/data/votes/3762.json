    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $3,100,000.00 with Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (CFCFA) to provide gap funding for urban redevelopment projects.\n \nThe CFCFA will provide gap funding for projects within the City of Columbus’ urban core and adjacent neighborhoods in order to facilitate projects that will assist in the revitalization of properties.  The CFCFA will help fill funding gaps for the redevelopment of smaller scale projects in traditional neighborhood corridors. Urban redevelopment projects often encounter issues not experienced by new build projects or projects not built on undeveloped land (e.g. older buildings having amplified costs to bring it up to current code and safety standards).\n \nEmergency legislation is requested to allow redevelopment projects to maintain their project schedule.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Department of Development Capital Improvement Budget.
