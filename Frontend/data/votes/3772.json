    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance amends the 2021 Capital budget and  authorizes the expenditure of $980,500 from the Auditor Bond fund for the technical and development work to the Auditor’s financial system and Azure platform assets. This legislation authorizes the City Auditor to enter into contract with OnActuate Consulting for professional services and modify existing contracts with Microsoft Corporation and Dell Marketing LP to expand its Azure platform licensing, storage, and related services to accommodate expanded functionality and declares an emergency.\nThe City Auditor’s Office has successfully migrated its financial system to Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations system (D365) and has been operational on the upgraded product since January of 2021. Part of the upgrade included code migration and customized extensions for continuing service operations. The project also included implementing Microsoft Point of Sale module included with D365 to replace a separate third party application to provide a seamless experience to end users and to reduce system complexity, maintenance, and licensing costs for the City as Point of Sale is included in D365 licensing. \nSince going live in D365, the City has continued to receive regular release upgrades, quality updates, and more features base lined into the public sector industry version. When features are introduced in the regular industry product where the City may have custom extensions already built, adjustments are needed to replace the City’s custom code with extensions that recognize these new baseline features to avoid software conflicts in current and future releases. Additional infrastructure capabilities are now available to link integrations between D365 and apps more tightly. One of many improvements is dual-write capabilities to write changes in D365 to a dataverse to provide automated dataflow for an integrated user experience across applications such as the City’s Public and Vendor portal, used for supplier management and bidding. The portals need code alterations and other changes to use this functionality to improve the stability and responsiveness of these key applications \nAnother significant change requiring refactoring of D365 is the Software Development Kit (SDK) changes to the Point of Sale product by Microsoft.  SDKs are the toolsets that allow extensions to the product to customize processing and posting within the module. Every several years, changes and enhancements are done by the software manufacture to the SDK.  While implementing Point of Sale, the City, through its partner, built extensions using the existing SDK to facilitate functionality needed for cashiering operations at Health, Public Utilities, Public Service, Treasurer, and City Auditor’s Office. In order to continue functionality of these programmed extensions, the platform code will need updated to work with the new SDK announced in 2022. This contract will include work to perform this code migration. \nThe initial implementation was also limited in scope to moving from DAX 2012 to D365 as well as implement point of sale for providing like for like functionality and replacing a third party application for cashiering. The implementation did establish a platform for modernization and opportunity future capabilities for interacting, sharing, and managing data. Now that D365 is operational and stabilized, the City can enhance and expand these capabilities by further extending this infrastructure to provide data visualizations, develop automated process applications to improve effectiveness, and public portals for transparently sharing City financial information. \nFinally, the infrastructure work will allow the City to build a foundation for business continuity and integrations between the Dayforce and D365 applications. \nA request for waiver of the formal competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is requested due to the need to quickly secure the services to avoid delays and interruptions to vital financial operations.  \nIt is manifestly impractical to bid these services at this time as the SDK and platform changes need to be made prior to the October release and the work will take at least 4 months to complete and test after establishing a contract and initiating services. The City currently does not have the staffing or expertise to perform these services and to complete within the timeline allotted by the software manufacturer. \nOnActuate has access to the City’s Azure and D365 infrastructure as the City’s named D365 partner of record with Microsoft. It is intimately familiar with the City’s point of sale extensions, as well as the custom code migrated as part of the implementation and now needing adjusted in order to absorb the new features without creating conflicts in the data processing. OnActuate is also authorized to access and utilize Visual Studio subscriptions in the environment necessary for the code migration.  Changing contractors at this time would require significant transition and ramp up time for providing the necessary access and knowledge needed to perform these services, while OnActuate, due to its role in both implementation and ongoing support can begin immediately. Additionally, the City Auditor’ Office desires to leverage this update work in the platform to further automate processes and provide transparency with data visualizations. \nWhile the platform and infrastructure updates are being put in place, enhancement and expansion of parts of the platform can be performed in parallel for maximum efficiency in use of time and resources.  Ordinance No. 0824-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on April 18, 2022 authorized operating expenses for regular maintenance and support of the D365 product by OnActuate. This infrastructure and development work is not included in regular maintenance and support\nMicrosoft is the software manufacturer of D365 and the Azure platform used by the City for its financial and operations. Agreements for the infrastructure items are to be acquired through existing Enterprise Agreements. Dell Marketing, LP is the City’s Microsoft Enterprise Agreement provider for years 2020-2023 as selected by the City’s Department of Technology. Additional licensing, storage, and services related to this project are to be procured through the EA agreements previously established. \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency. Emergency action is requested to ensure that a contract is established by the City Auditor’s to start and complete development work required for Microsoft SDK and platform changes, thus ensuring that the work will be completed timely in order to accept new releases to the product and to continue the functioning of D365 and the Point of Sale systems at various City Agencies. \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nThis ordinance amends the 2021 Capital Budget to allocate for $980,500 for project work within the Auditor Bond Fund as follows:\n\n\n\nProject Work Description\n\nAmount\n\n\n\nAzure storage, Database, Data factory, Microsoft Licensing\n\n85,000\n\n\n\nSDK, Dual write, code migration, process automation, automated testing\n\n583,200\n\n\n\nEstablish Azure Data Lake, power platform,  data visualizations, transparency portal, infrastructure development, intellectual property ownership\n\n224,800\n\n\n\nAdditional development including: report writing, process automations, data exchanges, existing interface rework after data lake established\n\n87,500\n\n\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:\nEmergency designation is being requested for this renewal to continue with services that are necessary to support daily operation activities and to ensure no service interruption.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: \nOnActuate Consulting Inc., CC#CC027985, expires 6/28/2023, D365# 027985 \nPrincipal place of business:  777 Hornby St, Vancouver BC \nDell Marketing LP, CC#010030, expires 8/30/2023, D365#010030\nPrincipal place of business: 1 Dell Way, Round Rock, Texas\nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to contract with OnActuate Consulting and to modify the contract for Microsoft licensing and services through Dell Marketing LP; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code to enter into such contracts; to authorize the expenditure of $980,500.00 from the Auditor Bond fund; and to declare an emergency.
