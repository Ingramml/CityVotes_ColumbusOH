    "description": "Title\n \nTo designate June as National Men’s Health Month in the City of Columbus and to thank the National African American Wellness Agency on their efforts to improve men’s health.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Men’s Health Month is an annual observance aimed at raising awareness of preventable health problems and encouraging early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys and has been observed since 1994 ; and\n \nWHEREAS, despite advances in medical technology and research, men continue to live an average of five years less than women with Native American and African-American men having the lowest life expectancy; and\n \nWHEREAS, men who are educated about the value that preventive health can play in prolonging their lifespan and their role as productive family members will be more likely to participate in health screenings; and \n \nWHEREAS, risks to the health and well-being of our men and our families are on the rise due to a lack of education on, awareness of, and pursuit of preventive screening and care; and \n \nWHEREAS, The African American Male Wellness Agency has taken a stance to reduce disparities in premature death and chronic diseases among African American males by providing over 4,000 free health screenings yearly and innovative health education programs, including its annual African American Male Wellness Walk; and\n \nWHEREAS, the agency engages African American (AA) males across 16 U.S cities through strategic partnerships and outreach efforts that encourage AA men to prioritize their health and wellness; and\n \nWHEREAS, by engaging the African American community through prevention programming and health awareness campaigns, the African American Male Wellness Agency saves the lives of black men and their families; now therefore, \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby designate June as National Men’s Health Month in the City of Columbus and recognize the work of the National African American Male Wellness Agency.\n \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT: This Council does hereby thank the National African American Male Wellness Agency and its organizers, supporters, and volunteers for working to improve men’s health.",
