    "description": "Title \n \nTo honor and recognize Herbert Talabere for his contributions to the City of Columbus and the residents of our community.\n \nBody \n \nWHEREAS, as a passionate Community Leader, Herbert Talabere became concerned that the once pristine 1950s East Main Street Corridor, between Bexley and Whitehall, had declined into a blighted area, with drugs, thefts, and human trafficking, affecting both businesses and adjacent neighborhoods. \n \nWHEREAS, Herb took action by co-leading a community effort against the nuisance-ridden Motel One.  With over 500 police calls, this building was a magnet for violent crimes.  Due to his outstanding work, it closed in 2012 and was demolished in 2014.  \n \nWHEREAS, Herb Talabere then initiated the East Main St. Special Improvement District, the first community-based SID in the mid-east sector of the City of Columbus. \n \nWHEREAS, through perseverance and talent, Herb Talabere established a Task Force, receiving a $11,000  Columbus Foundation grant to hire an Intern from The Ohio State University, and a $5,000 contribution from the Eastmoor Civic Association, during his term as its’ President.\n \nWHEREAS, almost single-handedly, Herb tirelessly walked the East Main St. Corridor, distributing his own letters and documents, ultimately receiving over 60 business-owner signatures, fulfilling SID requirements. \n \nWHEREAS, through SID-generated funds, the Community Crime Patrol, Inc., and Special Duty Police Officers became a robust presence in the area, significantly reducing crimes, resulting in the attraction of social services, new businesses and street scape amenities, including, but not limited to: Southeast Healthcare, Tim Hortons, Bank of America and the City of Columbus $1.3 million Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund grant, for street lighting & tree improvements. \n \nWHEREAS, Herb’s life is filled with integrity, decency and honor.  After receiving a Masters of Public Administration Degree from Syracuse University, he moved to Columbus in 1971. He was employed with the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development in the Community Planning and Development Division. In the late 80’s he started and ran a wholesale gift business and later taught business principles to Immigrants before retiring. He lived on the east side in Bexley until moving to Eastmoor in 2003 when he retired. He served as President of the Eastmoor Civic Association for two terms.  Herb and Laurel have been married for nearly 61 years. They have 2 surviving children, 5 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. \n \nWHEREAS, despite his recent cancer diagnosis, Herb is steadfastly passionate for continued E. Main St. Corridor growth, having benefited many by his generous and selfless nature.  \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby honor and recognize Herbert Talabere for his lasting contributions to the City of Columbus and the residents of our community.",
