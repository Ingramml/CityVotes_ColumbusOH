    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground:  This ordinance is to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a continued lease agreement in 2021 for the lease-purchase payments of the golf riding cars with PNC Equipment Finance, LLC and Lake Erie Golf for the lease-purchase payments and maintenance of the golf riding cars; to authorize the expenditure of $295,680.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operation Fund; and to declare an emergency.\n \nThis arrangement was approved as a waiver of the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code 329 relating to competitive bidding by Ordinance #1150-2020.  In 2020, with the current social distancing mandates, the Golf Division researched best practices of open facilities to accommodate the requirements. Permitting golf carts for single riders only was a safe way for the Golf Division to provide the use of the carts while still maintaining a six foot space for golfers during the state wide restrictions. Single riders significantly reduce the number of golfers able to be served and creates a shortage for the demand. The Golf Division reached out to its current supplier to discuss additional carts for the golf courses to utilize since single riders potentially reduces the cart availability in half. \n \nThe contract includes three parties:\n•                     The City of Columbus\n•                     PNC is the source of financing \no                     Golf cart lease agreements and payments would be with PNC\no                     Yearly legislation would occur to fund payments \n•                     Lake Erie Golf is the golf cart maintenance company\no                     Lake Erie Golf would provide all cart maintenance for the duration of all contracts\no                     Lake Erie Golf does not receive payment for their contracted services\no                     At the end of our lease agreement with PNC, Lake Erie Golf gains ownership of all 385 carts\n  \nPrincipal Parties: \nPNC, Equipment Finance\n655 Business Center Drive\nHorsham, PA  19044\nStaysi Garcia Morillo, 267-960-4076 \n34-1880513                  \n \nLake Erie Golf\n26565 Miles Road\nWarrensville Heights, OH 44128\nDanny Hayes, 614-808-5735 \n34-1880513                                          \n \nEmergency Justification:  An emergency is being requested due to the Golf Courses expecting increased Spring 2021 participation and need for carts, and the need for the first lease payment to be made April 1, 2021. \n \nBenefits to the Public:  Golf carts are necessary to the operation of the golf courses. \n \nArea(s) Affected:  All six municipal golf courses.\n \nFiscal Impact: $295,680.00 is required and is budgeted from and within the 2021 Recreation and Parks operating budget to meet the financial obligations of this lease.  This piece of legislation is contingent upon passage of the 2021 operating budget. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a contract with PNC Equipment Finance and Lake Erie Golf for new carts to be delivered for the Spring 2021 season with payments continuing from the July 2020 agreement through December 31, 2025; to authorize the expenditure of $295,680.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operation Fund; and to declare an emergency.
