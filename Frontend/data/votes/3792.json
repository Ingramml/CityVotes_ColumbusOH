    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Craig Moncrief, Plank Law Firm, LLC, on behalf of his client, Lane and Norwich Columbus Owner, LLC, to extinguish the right-of-way and transfer a portion of the W. Norwich Ave. right-of-way and they will dedicate a new right-of-way in exchange. The transfer of the City portion of right-of-way is an unnamed alley consisting of 0.097 acres as described below and within the attached exhibit to allow for this area to be combined and developed. The area being dedicated will consist of 0.085 acres as described below and within the attached exhibit for a new alley connection.  \n \nLane and Norwich Columbus Owner, LLC will pay $15.00 per sq. ft. for the 496 difference in the square footage. Sale of this right-of-way will be used to connect the abutting parcels in order to build two multi-use buildings on the surrounding parcels. The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way with the understanding that the applicant will dedicate the new right-of-way and pay the difference for the amount as shown within attached legal descriptions and exhibits, and extinguish the need for the 0.097 acres of public right-of-way. \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way. The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $7,440.00 was established. This request went before the Land Review Commission on December 16, 2021.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Lane and Norwich Columbus Owner, LLC, at the cost of $7,440.00.\n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:\nThe City will receive a total of $7,440.00 and the dedication of a 0.085 acre tract of land for a new right-of-way area. The funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer and dedication.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of a portion of W.
