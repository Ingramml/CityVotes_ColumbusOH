    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Danbert, Inc. for the UIRF 2016 Sidewalks P2 project in an amount up to $80,000.00.\nOrdinance 1325-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Danbert, Inc. for the construction of the UIRF 2016 Sidewalks P2 project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.\n \nThe work performed to date for this project consists of the installation of sidewalks, curbs, and drainage improvements.\n \nThe work for modification 1 will consist of installing roof drain piping, top soil and waterpipe relocations, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract.  The conditions of the items to be added to the contract could not be determined until after starting construction.  \n \nThe original contract amount, no inspection:              $2,839,053.94     (PO279867/PO280655, Ord. 1325-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:           $80,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $2,919,053.94  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Danbert, Inc.\n \n2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of unforeseen work needed for the project that was discovered after construction began.  This unforeseen work exceeded the project’s contingency amount.  This work is required to install the sidewalks per plan. It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Danbert, Inc. is CC004618 and expires 2/9/2024.\n \n4.  Pre-Qualification Status\nDanbert, Inc. and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $80,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of modification 1 for the UIRF 2016 Sidewalks P2 project to facilitate the completion of planned improvements in a timely manner, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Danbert, Inc. in connection with the UIRF 2016 Sidewalks P2 projects; to authorize the expenditure of up to $80,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($80,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
