    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with OHM Advisors, Inc. to provide professional engineering and construction administration services for the Bicentennial Park Fountain Repair Phase II Project. The contract amount is $159,000.00, with a contingency of $30,000.00, for a total of $189,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nBicentennial Park is a premier special use park in Downtown Columbus that is part of the Scioto Mile. The Scioto Mile Fountain was added in 2011 and is a centerpiece of Bicentennial Park. Over the last several seasons of use, the fountain has been experiencing significant water loss while in operation. In 2017, repairs were made to the water line for one of the main features of the fountain called Halo A. Since then, leaks have been identified in supply water piping serving other features of the fountain known as Halos C, D, and E. A number of items have been identified for repairs necessary to keep the fountain running and to prevent leakage. Fixing the underground water lines will cause hard surface damage which will need to be repaired along with other areas throughout the site that already been identified as needing attention. Due to the different types of work required, the design and construction work was separated into phases. The first phase, which included leak detection, was completed in 2020.  This second phase includes repairing water lines that feed the fountain and the associated hardscape renovations. The design professional will review, evaluate, provide recommendations, and develop final construction documents for this next phase of construction. This work will include trying to minimize the area of construction disturbance at the site and accurately documenting as built conditions with ArcGIS Online. It is anticipated that new information will be discovered during construction that may lead to design changes. This is why the department is obtaining the services of one design firm for preliminary design and construction administration. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised to prequalified design professionals in accordance with City Code Section 329, on December 11, 2020 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on December 22, 2020.  Proposals were requested from the following companies:\n \nOHM Advisors, Inc. (MAJ)\nEDG (MAJ)\nResource International (MBE)\nPrime AE (MBE)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor were they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended OHM Advisors be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach. OHM Advisors, Inc. was also the only firm who replied to our request for proposals. \nPrincipal Parties: \nOHM Advisors, Inc.\n580 North 4th Street, Suite 630, Columbus, Ohio 43215 \nCraig Schripsema, 614-418-0600                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 007505, 38-1691323\nDecember 12, 2021\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the fountain renovations and resulting hard surface repairs can be completed before the end of 2021. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The Scioto Mile Fountain in Bicentennial Park is enjoyed by countless visitors as an interactive area for aquatic play. Repairing leaking water pipes reduces utility costs. These renovations also reduce the potential for underground damage from the leaks and repairing the hardscape around the site will make the amenities safer for people of various abilities enjoying the park. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Bicentennial Park is among the most visible parks in the city and is home to numerous special events and community festivals. The Scioto Mile and the fountain have had enormous popularity for residents and visitors alike, making it imperative to keep it in good condition for the community. The community has expressed disappointment when the fountain has had to be closed for repairs in the past and these improvements will help ensure it remains in operation for years to come. These improvements have been coordinated with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) who has been an integral part of the Scioto Mile’s development from its beginning and continues to be a strong advocate in keeping this site activated.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Downtown (55) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving infrastructure while helping make parks safer, more accessible, and user friendly. \n \nFiscal Impact: $189,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with OHM Advisors, Inc. to provide professional engineering and construction administration services for the Bicentennial Park Fountain Repair Phase II Project; to authorize the transfer of $189,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; and to authorize the expenditure of $189,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
