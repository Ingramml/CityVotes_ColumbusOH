    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group to provide professional engineering services for the Champions Bridge Superstructure Replacement Project. The contract amount is $45,669.17, with a contingency of $6,138.97, for a total of $51,808.14 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nChampions Bridge was part of the Alum Creek Trail Easton Extension Project that started at Innis Park and ended at the Easton soccer fields. During construction of this project in 2015, it was noticed that the superstructure of the bridge had deflected dramatically. Upon investigation, it was determined that there was an error of omission on the part of the design professional. This error has resulted in the bridge needing to be posted for loads lighter that what the federal design required. As a result, emergency vehicles cannot traverse the bridge.\n \nWhen the error was realized, a review of the entire project took place that resulted in structural changes to other structures that were also part of this trail extension project as well as the project from Airport Drive to Brittany Hills which was also designed by the same professional. Since these events took place, the Recreation and Parks Department has worked diligently with the design professional responsible for the errors, their legal counsel, the City Attorney’s Office, and GPD Group to ascertain the extent of the damage on the Champions Bridge and a method to remedy.  GPD Group performed the structural analysis of the bridge and recommended the load posting. GPD Group also served as the Project Engineer on behalf of Righter Company, the contractor who built these two trail extension projects.  They were also the firm that determined that it was safe for pedestrians as the Department took action on repairing this bridge. \n \nWith a recommendation and cooperation from the City Attorney’s office, the Department wishes to waive bidding and have GPD Group prepare the construction documents for the replacement of the superstructure of the bridge.  They have already performed the structural analysis on both the existing and proposed bridge as well as prepared estimates of probable costs for the bridge’s repair. There is not another firm with more familiarity of this project nor any other firm who can provide the value when it relates to preparation of the contract and permitting documents necessary to repair this bridge. It is the intent and desire of the Recreation and Parks Department and the City Attorney’s office to recover the damages for this error of omission which is anticipated to be approximately 1 to 1.2 million dollars once construction of the repairs is complete.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210, Columbus, Ohio 43215                                                     \nDavin Ng, 614-210-0751\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006560, 34-1334715\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 20, 2023                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as it is imperative that the bridge be repaired as soon as possible since the bridge currently does not have the capacity to carry an emergency vehicle as intended by the original design and this project will relieve the City from the risk of owning a bridge that is not code compliant.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: Safety on the section of the Alum Creek Trail between the Easton and Ohio Dominican University will be improved.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for safer parks through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northeast (41)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by maintaining a trail system that is safe for users.\n \nFiscal Impact: $51,808.14 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group to provide professional engineering services for the Champions Bridge Superstructure Replacement Project; to authorize the transfer of $54,167.16 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $51,808.14 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
