    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance is to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into the first year of the second two (2) year Renewal Term with Active Network LLC.; and to authorize the expenditure of $169,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285.  \n \nBackground:\nThe Recreation and Parks Department utilizes Activenet software applications to assist with the automation of the department's business and management operations. The system centralizes all data and provides around-the-clock access for citizens to register for activities and facility rentals via the internet, ID cards for individuals who participate at recreation facilities and events, marketing and informational tools that help keep the citizens informed of various programs and activities, and resources for security measures at the department's recreation centers and swimming pools among various other services. This software also provides for accurate accounting and a means to audit revenues collected in relation to the above activities.  Activenet has been the hosted online registration system for class registration at CRPD since 2008 when a bid process was used to select them.  Requests for proposals were taken again in 2015 and eight vendors responded.  A group of five CRPD staff evaluated the proposals and Activenet was selected to continue as the provider.\n \nBidding Information:  The Initial Term of the current contract with Active Network LLC, signed in February 2017, for maintenance and support of the Activenet software application concluded in 2020.  Upon the completion of the Initial 3-Year Term, the contract provides for automatic renewals for two (2) year terms (each a \"Renewal Term\") until either party gives written notice to terminate the Hosted Software no less than twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Renewal Term.  \n \nPassage of this legislation will authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into the first year of the second two (2) year Renewal Term with Active Network, LLC for hosted software, support and maintenance in the total amount of $169,000.00, and to declare an emergency.  Funding for the software maintenance and support are collected via transaction service fees from the on-line users. \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested because the provision of uninterrupted service, maintenance and support to the Activenet registration system is necessary in order to preserve public health, safety and welfare and to ensure continuous fiscal accountability and transparency\n \n                     Principle Parties:\n                     Global Payments, Inc.\n                     DBA Active Network LLC\n                                          PO Box 744932\n                                          Atlanta, GA 30384-4932\n                                          FID# 58-2567903\n                                          Vendor# 030763\n \n                     Fiscal Impact: $169,000.00 to be expended from Recreation and Parks Department Operating Fund 2285.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a contract renewal term for hosted software, maintenance, and support of the Activenet software application with Active Network, LLC; to authorize the expenditure of $169,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Department Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
