    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a contract with Sensus USA Inc. to provide ongoing software, hardware, and maintenance of the system that is required as part of the Enhanced Meter Project legislated under ordinance 1024-2020. During negotiations with the selected vendor for the Enhanced Meter Project, the department determined that using a Software-as-a-service (SAAS) and Managed Services model, which will include the vendor hosting all data and software on their computer servers as well as maintaining the system, is in the best interest of the City and the Division of Water.  This operating contract is for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the system and software to ensure the system implemented as part of the Enhanced Meter Project is usable. As legislated under Ord #1024-2020, the Enhanced Meter Project CIP will replace outdated and underperforming meters, install radio transmitting infrastructure to allow wireless readings relayed to the billing software at a central location, and provide an environmentally efficient way to read meters.  This is an operating contract which was negotiated after a vendor was selected as part of the Enhanced Meter Project legislated under Ordinance 1024-2020.\n \nThe Initial Term of the contract is from the date of execution through March 31, 2026.  The contract is subject to annual funding approval by Columbus City Council between 2021 to 2025 during the Initial Term.  The Maximum Obligation for the first year of this contract between the contract execution and March 31, 2021 was $275,000.00, and the second year was $1,625,000.00.  The Division of Water now wishes to add $250,000.00 in funding for the third year of the contract between April 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023.  If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. The City may, at its option, perform a contract modification under the same terms and conditions, for fifteen additional one-year terms after the Initial Term. Costs for these renewals after the initial term will be negotiated at a future date.\n \nSUPPLIER: SENSUS USA, Inc.  #51-0338883, (exp. 3/14/24, MAJ, DAX#008960)\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds:  The amount of additional funds needed for this contract is $250,000.00.  The funding for the first year of the contract, from contract execution through March 31, 2021, was $275,000.00.  The funding for the second year of the contract, from contract execution through March 31, 2022, was $1,350,000.00.
