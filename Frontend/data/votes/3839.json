    "description": "Explanation\n \n“Elvis” is a police canine that has been in service with the Division of Police’s Canine Unit for eight years and needs to be retired.\n \nThe handler of \"Elvis\" is retiring effective May 18, 2022.  “Elvis” is nearly 10 years old and has an obstinate temperament.  Retraining him with a novice handler would be unadvisable and economically impractical, due to his age and short remaining service life.  It would be in the best interest of the Division to take “Elvis” out of service and retire him.  \n \nIt is recommended that “Elvis” be sold to Office Kenneth Coontz, who is his handler.\n \nAdditionally, the Division of Police Legal Bureau has developed a general release document that relinquishes the City of Columbus from any liability as it relates to the post retirement care and control of “Elvis”, and assigns that liability to Office Kenneth Coontz.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThere is no replacement canine on order at the current time.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to sell to Officer Kenneth Coontz, for the sum of $1.00, a police canine with the registered name of “Elvis” which has no further value to the Division of Police and to waive the provisions of City Code-Sale of City-owned personal property.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, “Elvis” has been a Canine Unit canine with the Division of Police since 2014; and\n \nWHEREAS, the handler of \"Elvis\" is retiring on May 18, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, retraining “Elvis” with a novice handler would be unadvisable and economically impractical, due to his age and short remaining service life; and, \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to allow this canine to be purchased by Officer Kenneth Coontz for the sum of $1.00; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1. That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized and directed to sell a police canine with the registered name of “Elvis” to OfficeR Kenneth Coontz for the sum of $1.00.\n \nSection 2.
