    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety to modify the contract with Community for New Direction (CND) in order to provide a cost of living increase to their employees engaged in violence interruption and crisis response activities that include responding to specific violent confrontations, working to mediate and diffuse conflict tensions, and actively promoting peace building among our youth. \n \nOrdinance 0260-2022 authorized the Director of Public Safety to enter into a professional services contract with Community for New Direction to engage their violence interruption and case management professionals in the work of the Group Violence intervention initiative. This additional $100,000 will increase the base pay received by these individuals for performing their vital, continuous and potentially dangerous work. \n \nThe original contract amount: $329,500.00 (PO324701, Ord. 0260-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 1: $100,000 (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications: $429,500.00\n \nPrincipal Parties:\nJohn Dawson, CEO\nCommunity for New Direction  \n2323 W. 5th Avenue Suite 160\nColumbus, Ohio 43204\n(614) 272.1464\nContractor Federal ID #:  31-1430278\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis Ordinance authorizes the transfer of $100,000.00 within the General Fund from the Department of Finance to the Department of Public Safety in order to provide a cost of living increase to Community for New Direction employees engaged in violence interruption and crisis response activities. \n \nBid Waiver Justification: The original contract authorized by Ordinance 0260-2022 included a Bid Waiver in order to keep the consistency with the program participants and the vendor (interventionists).  They have been working with the NVI program for over 7 years; they know the program participants, the youth and young adults in the community and have established relationships with them.  It is important to keep the continuity of these relationships and trust.  A new vendor would have to come in and start from the very beginning to obtain this knowledge, understanding, and trust.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure the individuals performing complicated, potentially dangerous violence intervention work are appropriately compensated as quickly as possible. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify the contract with Community for New Direction to increase the amount allocated for the contract authorized by Ordinance 0260-2022 to provide violence intervention services; to authorize the transfer of $100,000.00 within the General Fund, from the Department of Finance to the Department of Public Safety; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
