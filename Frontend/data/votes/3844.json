    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a grant agreement with End the Violence in support of their community violence intervention program.\n \nEnd the Violence (ETV) is a crisis management and intervention organization that leverages the widely-recognized “credible messengers” approach to stemming violence before it escalates. ETV utilizes a team of community-based interventionists to provide alternative activities for residents who may otherwise engage in criminal and/or violence activity. ETV’s goals are to engage underserved hotspots in a culturally-informed manner, provide close-to-home work opportunities with pay, and to expose residents to opportunities for sustainable employment paying a living wage. In addition, ETV interventionists provide continuity and connections to supportive services to residents needing additional ongoing assistance.\n \nThis funding is expected to support community interventionists working throughout Columbus neighborhoods, as well as the funding necessary to support the activities that engage youths and residents most at-risk of engaging in violence. End the Violence will potentially subcontract with Columbus NextGen Corporation with regard to tracking and reporting on the use of grant funds.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Reimagine Safety subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately address rising neighborhood violence in Columbus.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a grant agreement with End the Violence in support of community violence intervention; to authorize an appropriation within the Reimagine Safety subfund; to authorize a transfer and appropriation of funds; to authorize an expenditure of $500,000.00 within the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
