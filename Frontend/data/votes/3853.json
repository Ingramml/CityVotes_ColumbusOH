    "description": "…BACKGROUND: \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\nDue to the effects of COVID-19, the City of Columbus recognizes many organizations providing summer employment opportunities may not have the capacity to do so in 2022. \n \nThrough the American Rescue Plan, up to $487,825 is allocated to distribute to qualified Columbus area nonprofit agencies. Subaward grant agreements will be awarded to Always with Us Charities, Look Ma No Hands and Classic for Columbus on behalf of GETCR8V.  The nonprofit organizations will serve at-risk boys and young men of color between the ages of 14-24 to help ease the challenges families face due to the current public health emergency. Importantly, all expenses must be eligible under the United States Treasury American Rescue Plan guidelines. Expenses must be necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) between March 10, 2021 and December 31, 2024.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that students can benefit from summer employment opportunities.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund passed by Congress on March 10, 2021 and signed into law on March 11, 2021.  \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor’s vendor number are \nAlways with Us Charities 018333 and is pending\nLook Ma No Hands 041882 and is effective 5/18/22 - 5/18/24\nThe Classic for Columbus on behalf of GETCR8V 038443 and is effective 7/13/22 - 7/13/23\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the expenditure of up to $487,825 within the Department of Neighborhoods; to authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into subaward grant agreements with Always with Us Charities, Look Ma No Hands and Classic for Columbus on behalf of GETCR8V in an amount up to $487,825 to add needed capacity to address COVID-19 specific services for boys and young men of color; to authorize the payment of expenses starting May 16, 2022; and to declare an emergency.
