    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a not for profit services contract with I Know I Can in support of The Columbus Promise program.\n \nFor a decade, Ohio has struggled to counter declining college-going rates amidst growing college costs. Then COVID-19 delivered another shock, putting college farther out of reach for many. Left unabated, these trends will undoubtedly have downstream effects on the workforce. In the 21st century, good paying jobs for those without training or education after high school are disappearing. This growing skills gap locks many in a cycle of low-paying work and forces businesses to import talent when they cannot find qualified workers. To foster inclusive prosperity and workforce competitiveness, Columbus must boost residents’ educational attainment, a critical priority infused with new urgency by pandemic impacts. This is a primary goal of the Columbus Promise, to make education affordable and desirable to Columbus City Schools (CCS) graduates. \n \nIn addition to workforce implications, education remains the most direct route out of poverty.  Students with a college degree have fared far better (even during the last recession) than those who either left school before graduation or earned only a high school diploma. On average, college graduates earn about a million more dollars over their lifetime compared to high school graduates. As part of an existing program model, I Know I Can - a not for profit 501(c)(3) doing business in the state of Ohio (IKIC) - will promote participation in the Columbus Promise to the more than 2,000 CCS high school seniors it serves annually. As part of program promotion, IKIC will work to increase FAFSA completion among seniors (57% in 2021 with a goal of 65% for the class of 2022) and also the percentage of students who complete at least one college application. Once these procedural steps are completed (ultimately increasing the pipeline of college-ready students), the Columbus Promise guarantees a gap-filling grant to meet students’ unmet need and provides a stipend to help with other costs like books and transportation at CSCC. In addition to these supports which will guide more students to pursue education and training beyond high school, students will enjoy specialized advising and wraparound supports once at CSCC to persist, understand transfer options, and explore connections to part-time or full-time job opportunities at partner employers. \n \nMoreover, if this pilot phase is successful, the Columbus Promise could grow across central Ohio. Some promise programs span many school districts, apply to adults, and incorporate four-year partners. Such a program could help thousands of residents gain skills, help companies more easily find talent, and become the signature workforce development platform in our region.\n \nThe services being offered via contracts with the above-named organizations cannot be provided by existing city employees as they are outside the scope of the City’s current responsibility and capacity.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding to support this agreement is available within the Job Growth subfund, as well as previously-established ACPO007222.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in providing services to students to facilitate their matriculation.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a not for profit services contract with I Know I Can in support of The Columbus Promise program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; to authorize an expenditure from an existing Auditor’s Certificate; and to declare an emergency. ($900,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, to foster inclusive prosperity and workforce competitiveness, Columbus must boost residents’ educational attainment, a critical priority infused with new urgency by pandemic impacts; and\n \nWHEREAS, on average, college graduates earn about a million more dollars over their lifetime compared to high school graduates; and\n \nWHEREAS, as part of an existing program model, I Know I Can will promote participation in the Columbus Promise to the more than 2,000 CCS high school seniors it serves annually; and\n \nWHEREAS, I Know I Can will work to increase FAFSA completion among seniors and also the percentage of students who complete at least one college application; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a not for profit services contract with I Know I Can to avoid any delay in providing services to students to facilitate their matriculation; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized and directed to enter into a not for profit services contract with I Know I Can in support of The Columbus Promise program to support program expenses between October 1, 2021 and June 30, 2023.\n \nSECTION 2.
