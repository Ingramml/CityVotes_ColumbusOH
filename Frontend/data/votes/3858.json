    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into a contract with Agile Network Builders LLC to maintain the connectivity from the communication towers to the City’s dispatch centers.  This is a leased circuit system the City uses to tie our radio system sites and dispatch centers together to operate, and in turn connects them to the state where the 'brains' of the system reside.\n \nThe radio system is used as a primary source of communications from the Department of Public Safety's dispatch center to public safety units in the field, for internal communications of public safety units, and for interoperability communications between federal, state, and other local public safety agencies.  Other Departments use the radio system for similar communications with their employees in the field.  The system aids the dispatchers by transmitting critical information by voice signal to radio users in the field.  \n \nOrdinance 1405-2015 authorized the second phase of the City's 800 MHz radio system upgrade to the P-25 digital system.  As part of this upgrade, Agile Network Builders established the infrastructure necessary to maintain connectivity between the City's communication towers and the dispatching centers.  An initial, multi-year maintenance contract was included with the upgrade and has since expired.\n \nBid Waiver Justification: Agile Network Builders LLC is the provider for the first of multiple required network connections to the State of Ohio MARCS system.  Agile provides these services to MARCS on state term contract which benefits the City by being on the same network, thus providing system redundancy, interoperability with MARCS and Franklin County equipment, as well as monitored network management. The original contract covered the first 5 years of maintenance.  The Department of Public Safety is requesting to extend the maintenance annually per the State Term Contract pricing.\n   \nContract Compliance:  \nAgile Network Builders LLC - Vendor#011487- Contract Compliance Number # 271949564 \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the continued operation of the City's 800 MHz Radio System Infrastructure.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The current maintenance agreement, originally funded through the capital improvement budget via 1405-2015, has expired.  Funding to renew this service was budgeted and is available in Support Services’ general fund.  The cost for maintenance coverage in 2021 was $134,750. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into contract with Agile Network Builders, LLC. for network connectivity; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize an expenditure of $133,920.00 from Public Safety's General Fund; and to declare an emergency.($133,920.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Support Services, is responsible for the 800 MHz radio communications systems; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Support Services has a need to enter into contract with Agile Network Builders LLC. for network connectivity maintenance service of the 800 MHz Radio Infrastructure; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 and use the State Term Contract pricing with Agile Network Builders, LLC. in order to receive the best possible pricing; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Support Services, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of the City's 800 MHz Radio System infrastructure, thereby preserving the public peace, health, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Safety be, and is hereby, authorized to enter into contract with  Agile Network Builders LLC for the maintenance of network connectivity on the 800 MHz Radio Infrastructure System in the amount of $133,920.00. \n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $133,920.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary in regard to the action authorized in SECTION 1, be and is hereby authorized from Fund 1000 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary \n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this Council finds it to be in the best interests of the City to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to Competitive bidding for this purchase.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
