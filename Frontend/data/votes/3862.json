    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance establishes new Columbus City Codes Chapter 1913 - Restrictions on the Deployment and Use of Equipment and Use of Force by Police.\n \nHistorically, federal programs such as the 1033 Program have supported the transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Such partnerships have undergirded a shift among police forces toward using more military-style equipment and approaches over time. However, this militarization is inconsistent with local law enforcement’s mission to protect and serve because militarization undermines public trust and creates barriers to the resident-officer connections that are necessary for law enforcement to uphold the public’s safety. \n \nDemilitarization is a tool for fostering trust and is complementary to other strategies, such as the civilian police review board and the use of body-worn cameras, which the City of Columbus has implemented. This ordinance builds upon 1500-2020, the first piece of demilitarization legislation adopted in the summer of 2020, which banned outright certain equipment that has no suitable use by Columbus police officers, mostly notably riot batons and camouflage uniforms. In contrast, this ordinance focuses on limiting, rather than banning, the use of certain equipment not addressed under the previous legislation.\n \nThe formulation of this ordinance was guided by significant resident feedback about the impact of the use of certain equipment, as well as recommendations from an Obama Administration working group made up of community groups, law enforcement, and legal and civil rights experts. Further, it codifies the permanent injunction from Judge Algenon Marbley relating to the summer 2020 protests, the contents of which are closely linked to the overall intent of this ordinance. Resident feedback has underscored the fact that the public’s trust in law enforcement is closely linked to the tactics and equipment they use, both in First Amendment demonstrations and in neighborhoods across Columbus every day. \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested so that the Division of Police may continue daily operations without further interruption.\n \nTitle\nTo establish Chapter 1913, Restrictions on the Deployment and Use of Equipment and Use of Force by Police in Columbus City Codes; to codify the permanent injunction issued prohibiting the use of control agents on nonviolent protestors and to curtail the use of force on nonviolent protestors; to require the report of all uses of force from the previous year to City Council; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, federal programs such as the 1033 Program have supported the transfer of military equipment to local law enforcement agencies and have encouraged the militarization of police forces over time; and \n \nWHEREAS, this militarization of police conflicts with the mission to protect and serve, undermines public trust, and creates barriers to the resident-officer connections that are necessary for law enforcement to support public safety; and\n \nWHEREAS, feedback directly from Columbus residents has underscored the fact that the public’s trust in law enforcement is closely linked to the tactics and equipment officers use, both in First Amendment demonstrations and in neighborhoods across Columbus every day; and\n \nWHEREAS, demilitarization, through the elimination and restriction of military-style weapons and tactics, helps the Columbus Division of Police and its officers better embody the peacekeeping at the heart of every officer’s role; and \n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Police, Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to establish restrictions on the deployment and use of equipment and use of force by police so that the Division of Police may continue daily operations without further interruption, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, welfare, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. There is hereby created in Columbus City Codes Chapter 1913 - Restrictions on the Deployment and Use of Equipment and Use of Force by Police, which reads as follows:\n \nChapter 1913 - Restrictions on the Deployment and Use of Equipment and Use of Force by Police\n \n1913.01 - Definitions\nAs used in this chapter: \n \n(A)                     “Control agent” means a chemical compound that temporarily causes debilitating effects in humans by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, or skin. Control agent includes, but is not limited to, substances commonly known as tear gas, pepper spray, and mace.\n \n(B)                     “Freeway” has the same meaning as in C.C.C. Section 2101.15\n \n(C)                     “Patrol rifle” means any rifle that is an automatic or semi-automatic firearm under .50 caliber. This definition excludes the handguns and shotguns issued to sworn personnel and the rifles used by sworn personnel assigned to tactical units that are approved by the division of police to be used during the course of regularly assigned duties.\n \n(D)                     “Specialty impact and gas munitions device” means a firearm that is intended to deploy “non-lethal” or “less lethal” ammunition, such as, but not limited to, wooden baton rounds, rubber bullets, or sandbags, for crowd control purposes.\n \n(E)                     “Tactical unit” means a special operations unit such as, but not limited to, SWAT or Investigative-Tactical Unit.\n \n(F)                     “Tear gas” means a control agent whose defining component is chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) or a chemically similar compound. \n \n1913.02 - Control and deployment of equipment\nThe following equipment shall only be issued to and deployed by officers assigned to tactical units of the division of police:\n \n(A)                     Wheeled armored vehicles;\n(B)                     Wheeled tactical vehicles;\n(C)                     Explosives and pyrotechnics;\n(D)                     Any device for which the primary use is to launch projectiles containing control agents the design of which intends that multiple individuals be impacted by a single discharge.\n \n1913.03 - Response to Non-Violent Protests; Use of Force and Deployment and Use of Equipment\n \n(A)                     In accordance with the Permanent Injunction issued by the Honorable Judge Algenon Marbley on December 29, 2021 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in the matter of Alsaada, et al. v.

For purposes of this  provision, reasonable incidental contact with individuals in connection with entering into or moving through a crowd to effect an arrest does not constitute the infliction of pain to punish or deter nonviolent protester action and does not violate division (A)(1).\n(4)                     Individuals legitimately displaying \"press, \" \"media, \" \"reporter, \" \"paramedic, \" \"medic,\" \"legal observer, \" or similar words and/or symbols are permitted to be present in a position enabling them to record at protests and/or to intervene to assist individuals who appear to have been injured so long as their presence does not physically interfere with a lawful arrest, involve entering a closed or cordoned-off crime scene, or physically interfere with medical aid already being rendered by an officer or an EMT/Firefighter, and that all individuals, regardless of their occupation or nonviolent activity, are permitted to record at protests or whenever any police officer interacts with the public.\n \n(B) In accordance with the Permanent Injunction issued by the Honorable Judge Algenon Marbley on December 29, 2021 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in the matter of Alsaada, et al. v.
