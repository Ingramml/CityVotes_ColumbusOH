    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize the Strength, Courage and Perseverance of Millions of Refugees and to Celebrate June 20th, 2022 as World Refugee Day in the City of Columbus.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 55/76 on December 4, 2000, to officially recognize June 20th as World Refugee Day. This year’s theme is “Whoever. Wherever. Whenever. Everyone has the right to seek safety;” and\n \nWHEREAS, the United Nations outlines the fundamentals of seeking safety to include the right to seek asylum, safe access to borders, no pushbacks, no discrimination, humane treatment; and\n \nWHEREAS, at least 82.4 million people have been forced to flee their homes worldwide, and 1 in every 95 people on earth have fled their home as a result of conflict or persecution. More than 32,700 residents in the Columbus metropolitan area were likely refugees, which is 17.7% of the overall New American population; and\n \nWHEREAS, in 2019, Ohio welcomed approximately 1,500 refugees, with many settling in Franklin County. This was possible because of the network of resettlement agencies who are actively working with refugees in Columbus regardless of their country of origin or religious beliefs; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has a proud history of welcoming refugees by offering a safe and thriving environment to support refugees seeking a new beginning. Efforts to support these communities are ongoing and constantly evolving; and \n \nWHEREAS, the local refugee community contributes an estimated $1.6 billion to the Columbus economy and supports over 21,000 jobs in the region. New American households at large held 10.1 percent of spending power in the metropolitan area and contributed $15.4 billion to the metropolitan area’s GDP; and \n \nWHEREAS, through resiliency, self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship, local refugees have established new paths and built networks of support and commerce which have had a positive impact in Columbus for new and existing residents; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate June 20th, 2022 as World Refugee Day and renews its commitment to welcoming and supporting all New Americans in the City of Columbus.",
