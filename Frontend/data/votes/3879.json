    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes awarding American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery funds, totaling $386,192.00, to four local non-profit agencies that offer programming to at-risk youth and young adults. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 is a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package proposed by President Joe Biden to speed up the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession. The final, amended bill was signed into law by President Biden on March 11, 2021. \n \nDue to the effects of COVID-19, the City of Columbus recognizes that many organizations providing summer training and programming opportunities may not have the capacity to do so in 2022. To help keep these programs going, the Department of Technology is allocating $386,192.00 in ARPA moneys, to qualified Columbus area agencies, including:\n•                     934 Gallery - $26,576.00\n•                     Columbus College of Art and Design - $51,700.00\n•                     The Past Foundation - $189,100.00\n•                     Artsway - $118,816.00\n \nThe aim of these organizations is to provide programming in various technologies, thus providing a foundation for future employment. For example, students will be introduced to 3D scanning, modeling and printing; cybersecurity; robotics; urban agriculture technology; photography; professional development; and college preparedness. The term of the contracts will be one year from the date of a confirmed purchase order by the City Auditor’s Office.\n \nThe services being offered via contracts with the above-named organizations cannot be provided by existing city employees as they are outside the scope of the City’s current responsibility and capacity.\n \nEmergency Designation\nEmergency action is requested to ensure that the funds are in place by summer break. \nFiscal Impact\nFunding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund passed by Congress on March 10, 2021 and signed into law on March 11, 2021.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into non-profit service agreements with 934 Gallery, Columbus College of Art and Design, The Past Foundation and Artsway to provide programming in various technologies; to authorize the expenditure of up to $386,192.00 from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency.
