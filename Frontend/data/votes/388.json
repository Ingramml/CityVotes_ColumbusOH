    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with American Structurepoint to add funds for design of the Arterial Street Rehabilitation-Hudson Street - I71 to Cleveland Avenue project.\nOrdinance 3295-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with American Structurepoint for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation-Hudson Street - I71 to Cleveland Avenue project.  Ordinance 1688-2019 modified the contract to add funds in an amount of $300,000.00.  Ordinance 3183-2019 modified the contract to add funds in an amount of $800,000.00.
