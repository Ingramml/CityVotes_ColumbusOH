($40,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Energility, LLC, in an amount not to exceed $40,000.00 for services related to the Department's Energy Retro-Commissioning projects.\n \nThis is a multi-phase project.  The original contract authorized by Ordinance No. 3315-2018 and approved by City Council on December 13, 2018 authorized Energility to perform the original energy audits (Phase 1) in 2018.  Ordinance 2729-2020 authorized a modification to provide funding for Phase 2A, which authorized technical support during implementation.  Energility serves as a consultant to the City for the purpose of conducting energy audits and for providing guidance on energy efficiency and retro commissioning projects that include but are not limited to: upgrading interior and exterior lighting fixtures, upgrading pneumatic controls to direct digital controls, various small-scale HVAC, electrical, control system projects, utility data automation, energy audits, and strategic energy planning.  The City is in the process of managing several retro commissioning projects pursuant to its award under the Bloomberg grant and Energility's expertise is needed for the procurement and management of these projects.  This ordinance authorizes a modification for Phase 2B, which will include technical support for implementation of lighting, window film, & additional HVAC/controls scope.\n \nPrices already established in the contract were used to determine the cost of this modification. The required level of effort exceeds the originally estimated level of effort as the extent of technical support required could not fully be identified in 2018 prior to conducting detailed audits and analysis.  In addition, whereas this work is already in-process, it would be inefficient to initiate a new procurement process.  Accordingly, the Department seeks to modify the current contract with Energility.\n \nEnergility, LLC.  Contract Compliance No. 47-3594698, expiration date April 23, 2024.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure not to exceed $40,000.00 with Energility, LLC for professional services in conjunction with energy efficiency and energy management projects.    \n     \nOriginal Purchase Order Amount:                                                               $ 89,096.00\nModification No. 1:                                                                                                         $ 42,330.00\nModification No. 2:                                                                                                         $ 40,000.00\nTotal (Original and Modification):                                                     $ 171,426.00\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify and extend a contract on behalf of the Office of Construction Management with Energility, LLC, for additional professional services related to energy efficiency and energy management projects; and to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the general fund. ($40,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend a contract with Energility, LLC, in an amount up to $40,000.00 for additional energy consulting services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract Phase 1, was authorized by Ordinance No. 3315-2018 and approved by City Council on December 13, 2018; and\nWHEREAS, modification 1, Phase 2A, was authorized by Ordinance No. 2729-2020 and approved by City Council on December 11, 2020; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the general fund for Phase 2B to include technical support for implementation of lighting, window film, & additional HVAC/controls scope; and\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management, Office of Construction Management, to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend a contract with Energility, LLC, so that additional energy consulting services can proceed on behalf of City departments; NOW, THEREFORE\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend a contract, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with Energility, LLC, for additional energy management related services and technical support.\nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $40,000.00, or so much thereof that may be necessary in regards to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is hereby authorized from the general fund.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That the monies in the foregoing Sections shall be paid upon order of the Director of Finance and Management, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 6.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
