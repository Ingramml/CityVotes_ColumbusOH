    "title": "To establish a new authorized strength ordinance for various divisions in the City of Columbus; to repeal ordinance 0788-2022; and to declare an emergency.  (REPEALED BY ORD. 2370-2022 PASSED 09/12/2022)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance amends the current authorized strength, as set forth in ordinance 0788-2022.\n \nThe strength levels for most general fund agencies are set to be equal to the 2022 budget as amended by City Council (including the Departments of Health and Recreation and Parks).  Authorized strength levels of smaller non-general fund agencies are set to be equal to the adopted 2022 budget as amended, while the strength levels of certain larger non-general fund agencies may have their strength set slightly higher to allow for flexibility in hiring.  \n \nWithin the City Auditor’s Office, 2 part-time positions will transition to full-time on the general fund, and the Income Tax Division will see a reduction of 3 full-time general fund positions in order to align personnel levels with the operating budget.  The Department of the Inspector General will add two full-time general fund positions. Two full-time positions will transfer from Columbus Public Health to the Department of Neighborhoods to reflect certain commission work transitioning across departments. In the Department of Development, 2 full-time general fund positions and 1 full-time grant funded position are requested in the Administration Division.  The Department of Health requests to add 21 full-time grant funded positions for upcoming American Rescue Plan (ARPA) initiatives.  Similarly, the Department of Recreation and Parks requests to add 17 full-time grant funded positions to assist with increased needs related to ARPA initiatives, as well as 10 full-time grant funded positions within the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging.  \n \nFiscal Impact: Funds for these strength levels are budgeted and/or the positions will not be filled until revenues have been clearly identified and appropriated.  In all cases, the ability to hire will be monitored by the Division of Finance and Management.  As such, there is no fiscal impact associated with passage of this ordinance.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the filling of budgeted vacant positions in certain departments in order to assure the immediate preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare.\n \nTitle\n \nTo establish a new authorized strength ordinance for various divisions in the City of Columbus; to repeal ordinance 0788-2022; and to declare an emergency.  (REPEALED BY ORD. 2370-2022 PASSED 09/12/2022) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Mayor's Executive 2022 budget was submitted to City Council on November 15, 2021 for consideration; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council adopted said budget on February 7, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance repeals authorized strength ordinance 0788-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to establish a new authorized strength ordinance to provide for the efficient operation of the city, and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That pursuant to Section 14 of the City Charter, the maximum number of officers and employees authorized to be employed within the various Departments, Boards and Offices of the City is hereby fixed and established as follows: \n \n-1- Refer to attachment ORD1578-2022currentstrength.xlsx\n-2- Refer to attachment ORD1578-2022previousstrength.xlsx\n \nThe foregoing positions authorized include all positions within each department, division, board, office or commission, whether appointed or elected except the members of any board or commission authorized by charter or ordinance.
