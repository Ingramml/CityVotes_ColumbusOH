    "description": "Explanation\n 1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Kimley-Horn and Associates to add additional funds for the Roadway - Mobility Study - NW Corridor project.\nPursuant to Ordinance 2639-2019, the Department of Public Service initiated a procurement effort that resulted in the award and execution of a professional services contract with Kimley-Horn and Associates in the amount of up to $500,000.00 to implement the Mobility Study - NW Corridor project.  The project includes establishing a Vision and Implementation Strategy for the corridor (Olentangy River Road from Bethel Road to West Broad Street) resulting in the development of a multi-modal transportation system supportive of mixed-use, transit-oriented, pedestrian, and bicycle friendly development patterns.\nThe first planned contract modification added funding to the original contract to allow for the continuation of requisite services by Kimley-Horn and Associates in the amount of up to $510,000.00.\nThis unplanned modification will expand on the LinkUS Corridor Framework Strategy developed in Task 3 of the original contract by further coordinating the implementation of multiple concurrently planned High Capacity Transit Corridors. The LinkUS Framework Strategy established the organizing principles and shared goals for implementing a system of High Capacity Transit (HCT) corridors. It outlined a series of next steps that will be needed to achieve strategy goals. This contract modification will facilitate coordination with the LinkUS East-West Corridor High Capacity Transit Plan (contract managed by the Central Ohio Transit Authority), including the integration of the Northwest and East-West Corridors and additional LinkUS mobility network projects through a coordinated implementation effort.  \n \nThe contract dollar amount to date is as follows:\nOriginal contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00     (Ord. 2639-2019, PO205703)                          \nTotal of Modification No. 1:                                                                                           $510,000.00     (Ord. 1450-2020, PO236942)\nThis Modification No. 2:                                                                                           $350,000.00     (Ord. 0545-2021)\nTotal contract amount including all modifications:                         $1,360,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Kimley-Horn and Associates.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Kimley-Horn and Associates is CC024725 and expired 8/13/2020.  Kimley-Horn and Associates will be contract compliant by the time Council reads the ordinance. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $160,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highway Improvements Non-Bond Fund, Fund 7766,  within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \nFunding for the remainder, in the amount of $190,000.00, is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund, Fund 1000 subfund 100018, Dept-Div 5913 (Traffic Management), Object Class 06 (Capital Outlay).  An appropriation is needed to establish funding for this ordinance.\n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to authorize the execution of the contract modification as soon as reasonably possible so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the project.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget;
