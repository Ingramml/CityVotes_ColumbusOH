    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) for the Linview Park Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of grant and matching funds. The grant amount is $46,505.00 and the local match amount is $139,515.00. There is a total of $186,020.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nIn June of 2020, the Recreation and Parks Department applied for grant funding through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources NatureWorks Program, as authorized by 0804-2020, to support the Linview Park Project. In December of 2021, the Department received notice that the grant was approved. \n \nThis project has been a collaboration between the Recreation and Parks Department and the Department of Public Utilities, through their Blueprint Columbus Program. Blueprint Columbus is an initiative that controls storm water in neighborhoods to prevent sanitary sewer flooding in homeowners’ basements and, as a result of controlling this sewer flooding, to improve the overall water quality in Columbus. As part of these efforts, this project will involve a retention basin to help control storm water in the Linden area. In addition to these benefits, Linview Park will become a 4.9 acre neighborhood park in the South Linden area of Columbus. The property has existing mature trees and a wetland that will be preserved as a part of the natural habitat in this dense urban neighborhood.  Park amenities will include a shelter, playground, and outdoor classroom area. These amenities will be utilized by students at the nearby Centenary United Methodist Church and School, as well as the community as a whole.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources \n2045 Morse Road, Columbus, OH  43229\nTimothy Robinson, 614-265-6528, Office of Real Estate Management\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005089, 31-1334820 \nExpiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)                                                               \n     \nBenefits to the Public: The near northeast area of Columbus lacks access to significant open spaces and parks. The timing of constructing a park, in conjunction with the Blueprint Columbus regional storm water facility between Linview Avenue and Denune Avenue, ties directly to the City’s goal of providing a lift to inner city neighborhoods cut off from safe and easy access to outdoor experiences. The scale of construction costs estimated in this project relies upon outside funding assistance, such as the ODNR NatureWorks program, to achieve these goals.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Public engagement meetings, open houses, resident surveys, area commission meetings, key stakeholder meetings, and on site meetings took place in 2019, gathering input for features to be included in the park design. Additional public meetings took place in February of 2022, providing project updates to the storm water portion of the project and in preparation for final design of the park amenities.  \n \nArea(s) Affected:  Northeast (41)\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing equitable and safe access to the City’s trail system for underserved communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $46,505.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. This ordinance will also authorize a grant match of $139,515.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. $139,515.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this grant match. There is a total of $186,020.00 available for this project. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once construction is ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for the Linview Park Project and accept a grant in the amount of $46,505.00 with a minimum local match of $139,515.00; to authorize the appropriation of $46,505.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget Ordinance; and to authorize the transfer of $139,515.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
