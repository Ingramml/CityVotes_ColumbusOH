    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up an auditor’s certificate in the amount of $200,000.00 for various expenditures for labor, materials, and equipment in conjunction with safety, security, and lighting improvements managed by the Recreation and Parks Department. These are expenditures that are intended to increase the safety in our parks. Contracts will be entered into in compliance with the procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329.\n \nThis ordinance will also authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with KNS Services, Inc. (KNS) for continued security camera services and equipment, as authorized by Ordinance No. 0164-2022. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is not to exceed $200,000.00. KNS has provided surveillance system installation and repair for the department for many years. They also service many other city departments including Public Safety, Finance, and Public Utilities. The have established a unique relationship with the Department of Technology to provide robust service to multiple departments in the city. The City of Columbus selected the Genetec software platform years ago for all departments to utilize for their surveillance systems with the vision of aggregating these services citywide. This effort has resulted in KNS becoming the provider of these services for several departments as Genetec requires the equipment to be maintained by KNS Services to avoid a situation where multiple vendors are given security clearance to access and make changes to the system. By authorizing the modification of this contract, the department will be able to quickly address many of our safety, security, and lighting needs by utilizing this experienced vendor and the contract already in place.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nKNS Services, Inc.\n8450 Rausch Drive, Plain City, OH 43064\nNathan Bladen, 614-733-3880\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005443, 31-1460220\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 8, 2023                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure that needed safety, security and lighting improvements are not delayed, allowing safety concerns that are identified to be addressed as soon as possible.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Having this funding in place for unanticipated needs as they arise will benefit the community by helping to ensure facilities are safe, accessible, and user friendly. \n \nCommunity Input Issues: Many issues that this funding helps to address come straight from the community, through 311 and direct contact with the department. The community has expressed the desire for safer parks with better lighting and surveillance through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99) - The entire City of Columbus is affected by having the funding in place to act efficiently on improving safety in our parks. \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This certificate and resulting projects support the department’s Master Plan by helping to ensure that facilities remain safe and user friendly. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $102,000.00 was legislated for continued security camera services and equipment improvements by Ordinance 0164-2022.
