    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Security Risk Management Consultants, LLC (SRMC) to provide professional services that will analyze the Recreation and Parks Department’s security related policies, plans, protocols, and standards. It will also include a physical assessments of eight pools and twelve parks. The contract amount is $78,795.00 with a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $88,795.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nSecurity Risk Management Consultants provided a full proposal for consulting services in July 2019. At the time, the Recreation and Parks Department opted to engage in a portion of the work as a phase 1 of this project. Phase 1, as authorized by Ordinance 2360-2019, resulted in a full study of security programming at 28 community centers, resulting in an initial report and assessment. Since that time, the Recreation and Parks Department has requested a phase 2 assessment that will analyze the Department’s security related policies, plans, protocols, and standards. Many of the protocols and standards will be in direct connection to ongoing efforts within the Department to obtain CAPRA Accreditation through the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA, Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies). This project will greatly assist in achieving this accreditation goal. Furthermore, this phase 2 will provide the continuation of physical assessments at eight pools and twelve parks.\n \nThis is a new contract, however it is based in part on their original proposal. A continuation of the work was desired at that time, however, the COVID public health crisis delayed our reengagement of this process. The selection of SRMC for the original phase 1 contract was a result of a RFSQ (Request for Statement of Qualifications) done in accordance with City Code Section 329. A selection team evaluated seven proposals and recommended SRMC, a City of Columbus Equal Business Office Certified Woman-Owned Emerging Business, be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their reference projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach. As a result of the existing relationship and familiarity with the project as well as the sensitive timing needed to collect this information in order to incorporate the proposed changes to the parks, pools, and policies, the Department wishes to waive bidding, continuing to work with SRMC on phase 2 of the project. Like most major cities, Columbus is facing challenges with respect to safety and security. The continuation of this work, along with having the consistency of this consultant, has become a very high priority. Therefore, we are requesting this bid waiver.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nSecurity Risk Management Consultants, LLC (SRMC)\n150 East Mound Street, Suite 308, Columbus, Ohio 43215\nLynda Buel, lyndab@srmcllc.com, (614) 224-3100\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 008568, 46-1774493\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 11, 2024                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested due to sensitive timing needed to collect this information and incorporate the proposed safety protocol changes to the parks and pools. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The safety and security of staff and residents is paramount to the experience of utilizing our facilities and parks. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for safer parks through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving the safety and security of department parks and facilities while promoting the overall well-being of residents.\n \nFiscal Impact: $88,795.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Security Risk Management Consultants, LLC (SRMC) to provide professional services that will analyze the Recreation and Parks Department’s security related policies, plans, protocols, and standards; to authorize the expenditure of $88,795.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
