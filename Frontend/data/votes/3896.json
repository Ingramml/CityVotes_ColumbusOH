    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the vendor name on, and renew an existing professional engineering services agreement as the firm is now named Xylem Vue, Inc. as they have merged with the original firm, EmNet, LLC, for the Real Time Control Sewer System Optimization, Part 2 Project, CIP# 650009-100003.\n \nThis is a task order contract to provide maintenance, technical support, and upgrades for the City’s Real Time Decision Support System.  The City will request services as the needs arise.  Several types of services are covered under the agreement such as system maintenance, providing new or added functions, updates to user manuals and operational plans, staff training, coordination with other projects, engineering studies, and Quality Control/Quality Assurance. \n \nCommunity Planning Areas: 99 Citywide\n \nFUTURE RENEWALS:  This is the first renewal of a five-year planned contract, composed of the original contract and four annual renewals.  \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $500,000.00\nGeneral Engineering (original 2021)                     $500,000\nRenewal 1 (this ordinance)                                    $500,000\nRenewal 2 (future 2023)                                        $500,000\nRenewal 3 (future 2024)                                        $500,000\nRenewal 4 (future 2025)                                        $500,000\nTotal for all renewals                                          $2,500,000\n \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant has already provided both design phase and construction phase services for all the projects assigned to this contract.  Bidding this work out to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the work already performed and would interrupt construction phase services for projects currently under construction.  \n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe City identified the services that would be needed for the project over the renewal period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project and subsequently revised by consultant based on City’s comments.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  The real time control program aims to provide treatment plant operators with a framework to help maximize treatment and storage, while reducing overflows within the sewer system. This is beneficial to the environment and could help reduce fees associated with CSOs.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  The Contract Compliance Number for Xylem Vue, Inc. is 85-1368169 (expires 2/25/2023, MJ, DAX #034990).   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Xylem Vue, Inc.\n \n \n6. FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance is contingent upon the receipt of the 2022 bond sale proceeds authorized by Ord. 0057-2022.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing agreement to reflect the new name and vendor information; to renew the same existing agreement with Xylem Vue, Inc. for professional engineering services for the Real Time Control Sewer System Optimization, Part 2 Project; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the Sanitary General Obligation Bond Fund, contingent upon the 2022 bond sale deposit.
