    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) has issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for approximately $889 million in discretionary grant funding through the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) grant program.  This is the fourth round of funding for the INFRA grant program.  The NOFO was released on February 17, 2021 and will remain open only through March 19, 2021.\n \nUSDOT is seeking applicants for the FY 2021 round of the INFR discretionary grant program to fund transportation projects of national and regional significance that are in line with the Biden Administration’s principles for national infrastructure projects that result in good-paying jobs, improve safety, apply transformative technology, and explicitly address climate change and racial equity.  The funding available for this year’s grants totals approximately $889 million.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an INFRA program grant application.  The Department of Public Service is working with the Department of Development as well as the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) regarding an INFRA program grant application in support of the ongoing I-70/I-71 Columbus Crossroads project and related local projects.  The City has previously partnered with MORPC and ODOT to submit a BUILD application in July 2018, and INFRA applications in March 2019 and March 2020 in support of the Columbus Crossroads project.  The Department of Public Service has confirmed that MORPC and ODOT would be willing to support another INFRA application for the Columbus Crossroads project.  \n \nThe precise scope of the application is still being finalized, but it will be similar to the previous applications: replace the freeway bridges over the Scioto River and railroad tracks on the Scioto’s east bank; complete the South Innerbelt Trench; and rebuild the High Street Bridge, Third Street Bridge, and Fourth Street Bridge.  ODOT is the lead agency responsible for the construction of this work, which will approximately $230 million.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally apply for an INFRA program grant as either the lead applicant or joint applicant.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USDOT, ODOT, or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nINFRA grants may be used for up to sixty percent (60%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with an application prior to the application period’s end.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to solely or jointly apply for an Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Program Grant from the United States Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Transportation and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced the third round of funding for the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) program, which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDOT is accepting applications for the FY 2021 funding round through March 19, 2021; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City intends to partner with other interested stakeholders, including the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), to submit a funding application for the I-70/I-71 Columbus Crossroads project and related local projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, the interested stakeholders have yet to identify the most appropriate lead applicant and primary award beneficiary, but the City of Columbus will be involved in the application process and the use of the funds if awarded; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to prepare and submit the aforesaid grant application prior to the end of the application period, for the public health, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to solely or jointly submit an application for a grant from USDOT’s INFRA program;
