    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC for an additional year to provide Licensed Landfill Services for the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program and add up to $20,000.00 for services in 2021.\n \nOriginal Contract Amount                     $45,000.00                     PO224895\nRenewal 1                                                               $20,000.00                     \nTotal Contract Amount                     $65,000.00\n \nThe purpose of the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program is to provide abatement of high grass, weeds, and solid waste removal on specifically designated, privately owned property where the City has determined it necessary to take action pursuant to Columbus City Code Section 701.19.  The department hires contractors to provide these services and then contracts directly with a licensed landfill to receive the material removed by the contractors.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ015150 on Vendor Services in March 2020 for Licensed Landfill Services and received one bid.  The director entered into contract with the one bidder under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to February 28, 2021, with an option to renew one additional year, through 2021.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result a delay in providing these services.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract.\n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending February 28, 2022.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The funding for this contract is available in the Division of Code Enforcement’s 2021 General Fund budget.   \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 009867 and the contract compliance renewal is pending.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to renew a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC for an additional year to provide Licensed Landfill Services as part of the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program, and add up to $20,000.00 for services in 2021; to authorize the expenditure of up to $20,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($20,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC for an additional year to provide Licensed Landfill Services as part of the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program and add up to $20,000.00 for services in 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ015150 on Vendor Services in March 2020, one bid was received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with the bidder under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending February 28, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that this contract renewal should be authorized immediately to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to renew a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC in an amount up to $20,000.00 for an additional year ending February 28, 2022, to provide Licensed Landfill Services for the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $20,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-03 (Code Enforcement) in Object Class 03 (Contractual Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.                     That the funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
