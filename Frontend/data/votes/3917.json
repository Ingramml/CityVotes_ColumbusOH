    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health’s Environmental Health Division has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $150,000.00 in grant monies to fund the 2022 Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) grant program, for the period April 30, 2022 through November 30, 2023.\n \nThe WPCLF program was created to assist the residents of Ohio with the repair or replacement of failing septic systems in hopes to improve the overall water quality in the state.  The program is providing financial assistance to low to moderate income homeowners with the repair or replacement of failing systems. Columbus Public Health will solicit and identify local homeowners in Columbus that meet the income eligibility criteria outlined in the program.  Columbus Public Health hopes to identify and repair/replace approximately 20 systems within the City of Columbus.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so the identification of septic systems can begin immediately and to use all funds allocated to this program.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The 2022 WPCLF program is entirely funded by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and does not generate revenue or require a City Match.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in the amount of $150,000.00 for the 2022 WPCLF program;
