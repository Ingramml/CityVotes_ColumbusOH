    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into a contract with Motorola Solutions Inc. for the ongoing maintenance and support of the second phase of an upgrade to the City of Columbus 800MHz Radio System from an analog to a digital system that serves nearly all city departments including Public Safety, Public Utilities, Public Service, Development, and Recreation and Parks. The radio system is used as a primary source of communications from the Department of Public Safety's dispatch center to public safety units in the field, for internal communications of public safety units, and for interoperability communications between federal, state, and other local public safety agencies.  Other Departments use the radio system for similar communications with their employees in the field.  The system aids the dispatchers by transmitting critical information by voice signal to radio users in the field.  The City first installed the 800 MHz Radio System in April 1992 and upgraded the infrastructure with Federal Grant Funds in 2006. The 2015 upgrade brought the radio system up to the most current industry standard of public safety radio systems and allowed the City of Columbus to retain the level of interoperability communications with its partners who have upgraded to the P-25 Digital System.\n \nOrdinance 1405-2015 authorized the second phase of the City's 800 MHz radio system upgrade to the P-25 digital system. It incorporated the installation of all new infrastructure at the City of Columbus' 800MHz tower sites, connectivity of the tower sites to the State of Ohio's system, and included testing and migration of all agencies to the new infrastructure.  Motorola installed all of the new infrastructure at the communications sites and connectivity from the tower sites, and tested and migrated all of the agencies to the new infrastructure.  \n \nBid Information: This purchase is being executed in accordance with the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code. The ongoing maintenance and support of the existing system requires proprietary software and infrastructure owned by Motorola Solutions Inc.  No other vendor has access to Motorola source code and Motorola has not authorized any dealer or other party to obtain such access.\n \nContract Compliance: Motorola Solutions Inc. V#007169 36-1115800   expiration 7/1/2023\nEmergency Designation: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the continued operation and maintenance of the City's 800 MHz Radio System Infrastructure.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $990,965 with Motorola for annual maintenance and support of the city's 800 MHz Radio System.  Funding to renew this service was budgeted and is available in Support Services’ 2022 general fund appropriation.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into a contract with Motorola Solutions Inc. for the maintenance and support of the City's 800MHz radio P-25 digital system in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize an expenditure of $990,965.00 from Public Safety's General Fund budget; and to declare an emergency.
