    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with US Together in the amount of $15,000.00 in support of the Gateways for Growth Project of Central Ohio.  \n \nThe Gateways for Growth Challenge (G4G) was created in 2016 to provide support to communities that have demonstrated leadership and commitment to developing an inclusive, accessible, and welcoming environment to all residents. American Immigration Council (recently merged with New American Economy) and Welcoming America have awarded over 70 communities nationwide with tailored economic research reports on the contributions of immigrants; technical assistance in the development of a multi-sector strategic welcoming plan; and matching grants to bolster this work.\n \nIn 2020, Central Ohio (Columbus) was selected as one of 19 communities in Round IV of the G4G award and was one of only ten to receive technical assistance. Central Ohio partook in a year-long strategic planning process and brought together leaders across multiple sectors to create a welcoming plan. This award served as a testament to the strength of the community and its multi-sector partners’ dedication to building a robust plan that will benefit all residents. \n \nThis year, Central Ohio (Columbus) was selected as one of six (6) communities to receive G4G Implementation Technical Assistance and Grant Award dollars to help implement recommendations from the welcoming plan. This award serves as a commitment from our national partners to continue support of our local welcoming plan, “Central Ohio’s Plan for Welcoming Immigrants and Refugees,” as well as Central Ohio’s commitment to engaging the community in this work.  \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to ensure that US Together can immediately begin their Implementation of the Gateways for Growth Project and Welcoming Plan for the residents of Central Ohio.\n \nContract Compliance: The vendor number is 010453 and contract compliance expires 4/23/2023.\n \nFiscal Impact: Total appropriation is $15,000.00 and is available in the Neighborhood Initiative subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with US Together Inc. in the amount of $15,000.00 in support of the Gateways for Growth Project of Central Ohio; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
