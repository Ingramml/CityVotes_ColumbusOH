    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten. Kindergarten readiness is a multidimensional construct reflecting young children’s preparedness for instruction in areas related to both academic and social-emotional skills. Children who arrive to kindergarten with limited readiness in one or more of these areas face challenges in the transition into the kindergarten setting, and are susceptible to academic achievement over time.\n \nParticipation in quality early childhood education can provide an important mechanism for developing children’s school readiness; likewise, certain intentional parenting practices, such as shared book-reading and numeracy discussions, also can support school readiness. However, not all children have access to quality early learning programs and/or intentional parenting practices.\n \nBecause of this, the City has previously partnered with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at Ohio State University on the Summer Success program, a four-week intensive summer readiness ‘camp’ for children without prior ECE experience and those who may not have sufficient supports at home for developing key readiness skills.\n \nThis year, the Office of Education is partnering with the Crane Center to develop and distribute summer at-home toolkits to enhance the kindergarten readiness of rising kindergarteners. Children will be led through activities that include language and literacy development; print awareness, numeracy, and social-emotional skills.  Stage completions are incentivized.  Participation, and eventual kindergarten readiness test scores, will be tracked and analyzed. Children will be enrolled via a partnership with Nationwide Children Hospital’s Pediatric Primary Care network, with a priority on Linden and Whitehall children.  95 percent of children in this program are Medicaid-eligible.\n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests permission to contract with the Crane Center to provide this crucial work.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $144,499.00 from the 2022 Office of Education’s General Fund operating budget.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the work can begin as soon as possible\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at the Ohio State University for the 2022 Summer Success Program, to enhance the kindergarten readiness of entering kindergarteners through educational summer materials, to authorize the expenditure of $144,499.00 from the General Fund, and to declare an emergency.
