    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThe City of Columbus, Columbus Public Health, receives funding for the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio Grant Program from the Ohio Department of Health. The purpose of this grant is to create “Disruptive Innovation” by seeking to prevent new HIV infections by focusing on four (4) pillars:  treating HIV to achieve viral suppression, diagnose HIV so that all persons know their HIV status, prevent infections through PrEP and syringe support programs and respond to HIV clusters or outbreaks within the community.  This grant specifically focuses on the diagnose and prevent pillars.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into and, if needed, modify a contract with KW2 help Columbus Public Health partner with Stonewall Columbus, Equitas Health, Gilead, and AIDS Healthcare Foundation to host a free HIV/STI testing event and promote HIV testing and PrEP initiation around National HIV Testing Day. This event will provide access to testing, consultation, and education for all participants while providing a fun and celebratory atmosphere building off the energy of Pride Month, as well as National HIV Testing Day.  The term of the contract is June 1, 2022 through July 31, 2022 with funding based on vendor estimates of annual funding requirements for allowable services. \n                                                               \nKW2: $123,410                                                               \n  \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a contract with KW2, modify said contract if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds by entering into contracts with newly identified and qualified vendors without the need for additional legislation.
