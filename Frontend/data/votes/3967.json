    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) is accepting Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Round 37 applications for the Local Transportation Improvement Program (LTIP) and State Capital Improvement Program (SCIP).  MORPC serves in a staff support capacity to the District Three (Franklin County) Public Works Integrating Committee (PWIC).\n \nOPWC requires that a designated official be authorized to submit said applications and execute project agreements for approved projects.  Additionally, OPWC is required to award a minimum of 10% of the SCIP funding as a no interest loan; in order to make City applications more favorable, some of the applications may include a request for a no interest loan.  Therefore, the applications and ensuing agreements may also require a signature from the Director of Finance and Management and City Auditor, as appropriate, to sign for funding use certification, local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to submit applications and to execute project agreements for approved projects.  The legislation will also authorize the Director of Finance and Management and City Auditor, as appropriate, to sign for funding use certification, local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service plans to submit applications for the following projects:\n \n545019-100000:  Signals - Summit St Phase 2 - This project consists of the design of a replacement and upgrade to current standards of the existing traffic signals along Summit Street from Chittenden Avenue to Hudson Street, excluding the signal at 17th Avenue.  This includes the intersections of Summit Street with Chittenden Avenue, E.  12th Avenue, E.  15th Avenue, E.  Lane Avenue, and E.  Hudson Street.  The total project cost is approximately $3,775,000.\n \n530103-100061:  Arterial Street Rehabilitation - E.  Broad Street Widening - This is the first phase of a major widening project to construct new through and turn lanes of various configurations in the E.Broad Street corridor from the east side of the I-270 interchange to the intersection of E.  Broad Street and Reynoldsburg-New Albany Road.  This first phase will construct new pavement for the widening and resurfacing of the existing pavement from the I-270 interchange to Outerbelt Street and will include traffic signal improvements; addition of a shared use path, sidewalk, street lighting, signal interconnect conduit; and incidental improvements such as drainage, traffic control, sediment and erosion control, water adjustments, and maintenance of traffic.  The total project cost is approximately $25,076,359.\n \n530103 -100060:  Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening (Bexley Corp to 7th Av) - Improvements to the Cassady Avenue corridor from the Bexley Corp to 7th Avenue.  The project includes improvements to E.  5th Avenue at the intersection with Cassady Avenue, and intersection improvements at 5th are anticipated to extend a total of 1100 feet.  Improvements at other side streets are assumed to be limited to intersection improvements only.  Cassady Avenue is planned to be widened to a 3-lane section and reconstructed as a complete street with pedestrian and bikeway facilities, lighting, curb and gutter, water line improvements, and closed drainage.  The project will also replace the existing rail crossing, and construct a new storm water basin.  The total project cost is approximately $13,444,929.\n \n(This listing is meant to be illustrative and is believed to be accurate and complete; however, last minute project additions and substitutions are permitted at the discretion of the Director of Public Service.)\n \n 3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nApproval of this legislation will provide an opportunity to secure funds for various projects.  The preliminary allocation for the District Three Public Works Integrating Committee is approximately $30,752,000, and it is to be awarded in the form of grants and loans.  As a part of the application for grant funds, the City may apply for a maximum of $3,000,000 in loans as necessary to make the applications more favorable to OPWC and the City.\n \nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe Department of Public Service requests emergency action to submit applications for grant and loan funding to OPWC before the application deadline.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to submit applications for the Local Transportation Improvement Program and State Capital Improvement Program and to execute project agreements for approved projects; to authorize the Director of Public Service and the Director of Finance and Management to submit loan documents and borrow money from the Ohio Public Works Commission for projects as awarded under the State Capital Improvement Program; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management and City Auditor, as appropriate, to sign for funding use certification, local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Public Works Commission requires that the City of Columbus designate and authorize officials to submit Round 37 applications, execute project agreements, sign for funding use certification and local match availability, and to certify loan portion repayment for Local Transportation Improvement and State Capital Improvement Programs;
