    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the total amount authorized for an existing contract with Tyevco, Inc. for construction of the Maintenance Headquarters Annex and Warehouse Upgrades Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $50,000.00.\n \nThe building attached to the Recreation and Parks Department’s existing warehouse was purchased years ago to allow for a warehouse expansion and to relocate three maintenance zones. Ordinance 2949-2017 authorized a construction contract with Tyevco to complete these improvements. As part of that contract and ordinance, a $50,000.00 contingency amount was authorized and encumbered. Since that time, due to internal miscommunication related to Recreation and Parks personnel changes as well as design changes within the original scope of work causing significant delays in completing the project, the auditor’s certificate holding these contingency funds was mistakenly canceled before the project finished. The purpose of this ordinance is to modify this contract so that the contingency amount can be restored, allowing the Recreation and Parks Department to make final payment to the contractor and close out the project. The costs were determined by already approved change orders for work that was satisfactorily completed by Tyevco. The contract amount and total due to Tyevco will remain the same as the original contract, however, this modification will increase the aggregate amount of the authorization. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTyevco Inc.\n1678 West Audubon Boulevard\nLancaster, Ohio 43130                                                      \nJames Boggess, 614-284-0251                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005691, 31-1626034\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 27, 2023       \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the work on this project was authorized by a change order, the work was satisfactorily completed, and Tyevco needs to be compensated for work completed.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: These improvements help the Department improve operations and services to the citizens of Columbus.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for well-kept facilities and parks through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff. This project will increase efficiencies that will help achieve these standards.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to ensure that facilities and parks remain safe and user friendly. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,070,466.00 was legislated for the Maintenance Headquarters Annex and Warehouse Upgrades Project by Ordinance 2949-2017. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $50,000.00. $50,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,120,466.00. The original contract amount of $1,070,466.00 will remain the total contract value. This ordinance is restoring $50,000.00 that was cancelled in error and is due to Tyevco for work completed and so the project can be closed out. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify the total amount authorized for an existing contract with Tyevco, Inc. for the Maintenance Headquarters Annex and Warehouse Upgrades Project; to authorize the transfer of $50,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
