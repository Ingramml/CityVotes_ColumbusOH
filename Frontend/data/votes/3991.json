    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement and all necessary amendments with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation (ODOT), for interstate pump station maintenance. In the interest of public safety and convenience, it is the desire of the parties hereto that the City of Columbus shall perform maintenance on, and make repairs to, all pump stations identified on I-71, I-70 and I-670 (“the Interstate Highways”) using its own labor forces, equipment and materials, or by contracting for these items, with reimbursement from the State.\n \nThe term of the original agreement was from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003. This 18th Amendment will be for the period of July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2023.\n \nODOT shall reimburse the City at a fixed rate of $121.96 per hour for the City labor, equipment and materials, or contracted labor, equipment and materials, used to perform the routine maintenance and operation of the interstate pump stations as defined in Paragraph 1.6 of the Agreement. In addition to pump station maintenance reimbursement, the City shall invoice the State monthly, or cause a utility company to invoice the State, for the cost of energy furnished to the pump station. The fixed rate may be adjusted each year on July 1st only by written amendment to this Agreement executed by ODOT and the City.\n \nAll other terms and conditions of the original Agreement shall remain the same and in full force and effect for the duration of this 18th Amendment.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nThe Division of Sewerage and Drainage shall be reimbursed at a fixed per hour rate for the City labor, equipment and materials, or contracted labor, equipment and materials, used to perform the routine maintenance and operation of the interstate pump stations. The City shall either be reimbursed for the cost of energy furnished to the pump station or cause a utility company to invoice and be paid directly from the State.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency to avoid a lapse between the 17th amendment to the Agreement (expiring 6/30/2022) and the start of the 18th (authorized by this ordinance), which would result in delays in the delivery of valuable public services to ODOT for the necessary interstate pump station maintenance.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement and all necessary amendments with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation (ODOT), for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage to provide interstate pump station maintenance and receive reimbursement from the State; and to declare an emergency.
