    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute a planned modification to the 2020 - 2022 Construction Administration/Construction Inspection (CA/CI) Services agreement with DLZ Ohio, Inc.\n \nFunding for this modification will be for the following Division of Sewerage & Drainage project:\n \n•                     Clinton Sewer District Number 3 Trunk Sewer Siphon Upgrade, CIP No. 650902-100000, Planning Area = 38 - Olentangy West, $247,109.24\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $247,109.24\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $1,227,027.50                     PO218447, PO218448/ PO235997, PO218450, PO218451, PO218452\nModification 1                     $     54,610.00                     PO228293\nModification 2                     $   668,555.17                     PO238163\nModification 3                     $     66,002.17                     PO253702\nModification 4                     $1,335,502.54                     PO266814 \nModification 5                     $   328,804.02                     PO272171, PO272160, PO272174, PO272176, PO272177\nModification 6                     $   697,932.58                     PO277886, PO277880, PO277882\nModification 7                     $   997,459.48                     PO315698\nModification 8                     $1,323,438.57                     (in process)\nModification 9 (current)                     $247,109.24\nTotal (Orig. + Mods)                                $6,950,223.05\n                                                               \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2020 - 2022 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 0052-2020.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multiyear contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/construction inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2020-2022) timeframe.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nCost proposals were provided by DLZ Ohio, Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage & Drainage, and deemed acceptable.\n \n2.0. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: 31-1268980 | Exp. 2/28/23 | MBR | DAX #4939\n \n3.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage projects include rehabilitation of existing sewers, repair to existing sewers, construction of new sewers, and construction of green infrastructure.  The majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues.\n \n4.0 FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  The Department anticipates requesting additional future modifications to this contract as new construction projects begin during 2022.\n \n5.0 EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This project requires work within the Olentangy River.  Seasonal variations in water levels limit the timing of when construction can occur.  Limited availability of construction materials is expected to lengthen the time window between project approval and beginning of construction.  The non-emergency approval process would likely result in missing the available seasonal window in 2022 causing significant project delays.  This project is on the critical path of OSU’s Cannon Drive Phase II improvements.  Delays for this project will have significant cascading effects for other components of the Phase II improvements.\n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Sanitary General Obligations Fund - Fund No. 6109 will be necessary, as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to execute a planned modification to the 2020-2022 Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services agreement with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the Clinton Sewer District Number 3 Trunk Sewer Siphon Upgrade Project, for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $247,109.24 within the Sanitary General Obligations Fund;
