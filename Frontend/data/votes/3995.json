    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to apply for and accept an Ohio 319 Grant to fund the Walhalla Ravine Stream Restoration project, CIP 650870-110167. The Walhalla ravine stream restoration is part of Blueprint Clintonville 3, more specifically, the Blueprint Tulane/Findley Integrated Solution project. The project will stabilize the banks of the Walhalla Ravine and reduce bank erosion and suspended sediment load. It is estimated to provide a 15.4% total suspended solids (TSS) reduction towards the total of 20% goal. The project will also restore 600 feet of the Walhalla Ravine with natural channel design and stabilize Walhalla Rd where applicable.\nIn 1987 the federal Clean Water Act amendments created a national program to control nonpoint source pollution, established under Section 319 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C 1329). Ohio EPA is the designated water quality agency responsible for administering the Ohio 319 program. Since 1990, Ohio EPA has annually applied for, received, and distributed Section 319 grant funds to correct NPS caused water quality impairment to Ohio’s surface water resources. Section 319(h) implementation grant funding is targeted to Ohio waters where NPS pollution is a significant cause of aquatic life use impairments. The cornerstone of Ohio’s 319 program is working with watershed groups and others who are implementing locally developed watershed management plans and restoring surface waters impaired by NPS pollution.\nThe application deadline for the Ohio 319 Grant is July 6, 2022. The Department plans to request up to $410,000 in grant money to fund the natural channel portion of the construction, and provide matching funds of $250,000. The remaining project cost will be funded through the Ohio EPA WPCLF Program. The total estimated cost of construction for the project is $1,500,000.00 \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The city plans to provide $250,000 in matching funds for the grant and request approval to enter into the grant agreement, if awarded, and provide the appropriation and expenditure of said grant and matching funds, in a subsequent ordinance.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is requested in order to apply for an Ohio 319 Grant by the deadline of July 6, 2022. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to apply for an Ohio 319 Grant from the Ohio EPA for the Walhalla Ravine Stream Restoration project, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Department of Public Utilities is interested in seeking additional grant money to help offset total project costs for the Walhalla Ravine Stream Restoration project; and  \n \nWHEREAS, The project will stabilize the banks of the Walhalla Ravine, reduce bank erosion and suspended sediment load, and stabilize Walhalla Road where applicable; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to apply for said grant by the grant application deadline of July 6, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Public Utilities is required to be authorized by Council to apply for the grant agreement prior to accepting and entering into a grant agreement; and\n                     \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the application for the aforementioned grant from the Ohio EPA in the estimated amount of $410,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to apply for an Ohio 319 Grant by the deadline of July 6, 2022; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities, be and hereby is, authorized to apply for a grant agreement with the Ohio EPA for the Walhalla Ravine Stream Restoration project in an amount up to $410,000.00. \n \nSECTION 2.
