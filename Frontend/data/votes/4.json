    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and celebrate Moody Nolan on being awarded the 2021 AIA Architecture Firm Award\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the annual AIA Architecture Firm Award is the highest honor the AIA bestows on an architecture practice. The award recognizes that that firm has consistently produced distinguished architecture for at least 10 years; and\n \nWHEREAS, Moody Nolan is the 1st African American Architecture Firm, and the 1st Ohio based firm to receive this prestigious award. As the nation’s largest African American-owned  and operated design firm  with 11 offices in the U.S. Moody Nolan has a long history of serving clients  with a keen knowledge of cultural sensitivities as well as a deep understanding of the impact its work has on individuals and communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, founded by Curt Moody, FAIA, NOMA, and the late engineer Howard E. Nolan, the firm’s work is centered on the belief that diverse perspectives foster creativity and more responsive solutions. Moody Nolan’s work is reflective of the people who will live, learn, and heal in the spaces it creates. Its work has been lauded with more than 320 design citations and significant awards, including Moody’s receipt of the AIA’s Whitney M. Young, Jr. Award; and\n \nWHEREAS, beyond  the compelling design of buildings, the firm views its work as a way to encourage architecture careers in diverse communities and carry on the firm’s legacy. That ethos is made clear in projects such as Columbus’ Martin Luther King Library, a vibrant community center that responds to both character of the surrounding community and the powerful legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King; and\n \nWHEREAS, in 2017, as a way to further its commitment to the community Moody Nolan launched the Legacy House project which is fully funded by the firm and select partner, the project is committed  to designing and constructing a home in each of the 11 communities in which the firm operates.  The first home in Columbus, Ohio, was completed in 2018 and was gifted to a single mother with three young children; and \n \nWHEREAS, as the nation grapples with systemic racism and significant issues of inequality, the ideals of diversity espoused by Moody Nolan since its founding stand as a model for advancing the profession. The firm has long operated at the critical junction of architecture and citizenship, demonstrating that responsible design requires a flawless marriage of art, function, and community; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate Moody Nolan on being awarded the 2021 AIA Architecture Firm Award.",
