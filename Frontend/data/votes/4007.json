    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety  to enter into contract with Tri County Tower for the state mandated work to relocate and re-cable the entire tower site on the roof of the James A. Rhodes State Office Tower.  The State of Ohio who owns the Rhodes Tower, is replacing the roof on the tower and has requested that all existing communication sites be relocated into new conduits. The City of Columbus owns a communication site on the tower and has to relocate this site before work begins on the roof replacement.\n \nThe tower company identified in this contract (Tri-County Tower LLC) is utilized by the state of Ohio MARCS radio system at a co-located site where Columbus also has a radio presence.  Due to state mandated work to relocate cable and re cable the entire tower site it would be more manageable and effective to have the same company doing all of the work. Ohio MARCS is already utilizing this company for their part of the work and the work needed by the city is almost exactly the same. The vendor has done work for the state at this site in the past and is intimately familiar with the location and the logistics of getting up to and working on top of the 41 story building the site is located on.    This service contract by the City of Columbus is from a competitively bid State of Ohio contract which is authorized by Ordinance 582-87 that allows for the cooperative purchasing between the State of Ohio Department of Administrative Services Cooperative Contracts and other government entities.\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nEmergency Action is requested in order to meet the deadline given by the state building management Going with this vendor would expedite the work to meet this deadline. \n \nBid Information: A competitively bid State of Ohio Term Contract exists for this purchase, Master Maintenance Agreement (MMA7484-1). Contract ID CTR000901\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $158,900.00 from Safety Bond Funds for the relocation and re-cabling of the City's communication site on the Rhodes Office Tower.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a contract with Tri County Tower LLC for the relocation and re-cabling of the City of Columbus' communication site on the roof of James A.
