    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Historic Resources Commission (HRC) (CC 3117) is charged, in part, with identifying districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects that are of significance to the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation; maintaining a list of these districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects; and providing regulation of these properties through design review.  With these goals in mind, the Commission provides recommendations to City Council for the potential listing of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties.  \n \nAn application has been made by Peter Ketter, Sandvick Architects (Applicant), in cooperation with Kolby Turnock/Half-Baked Holdings, LLC. (Owner), to list the property located at 427 Cleveland Avenue, the Ford Motor Company Branch Assembly Plant, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties.  The subject building is locally significant for contributions it made to “the expansion of automobile ownership in Columbus, throughout central Ohio and beyond, serving as the assembly, distribution, and service hub for a large region during the early 20th century, when Ford was leading the way in making automobiles accessible to the broader public” (Ketter p. 4). The period of significance for the building is from 1914, the year of construction, to 1938, when Ford Motor Company vacated the building. The Columbus Register boundary for the property consists of one parcel (Franklin County Parcel #010-015761-00). The entirety is bounded by Cleveland Avenue to the east, the I-670 right-of-way to the south and west, and an adjacent property to the north. \n \nProper notice was given to the property owner, per CC 3117.061, and a signed and notarized owner consent form has been received. A public hearing was held February 18, 2021, per CC 3117.063. The public hearing was attended by the Applicant and the Owner, who provided comments in support of the listing of the property. \n \nThe Commission voted unanimously to recommend listing of the property located at 427 Cleveland Avenue, the Ford Motor Company Branch Assembly Plant, on the Columbus Register based on the following criteria outlined in CC 3117.05:\n \nCriterion E: “The property is closely and publicly identified with an event, or series of events, which has influenced the historical or cultural development of the city, state or nation.”   \n \nListing of this property on the Columbus Register will facilitate its eligibility for historic tax credits in conjunction with the planned rehabilitation and adaptive use of the building.  This legislation is submitted as an emergency to allow the property owner to submit the historic tax credit applicant prior to the March 31, 2021 deadline. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None\n \nTitle\nTo list the property at 427 Cleveland Avenue, the Ford Motor Company Branch Assembly Plant, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties as CR #80; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Historic Resources Commission is charged, in part, with identifying districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects of significance to the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation; and\n \nWHEREAS, as part of this responsibility, the commission provides recommendations to City Council for the potential listing of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties; and\n \nWHEREAS, an application has been made by Alex Green, Sandvick Architects (Applicant), in cooperation with Kolby Turnock/Half-Baked Holdings, LLC.
