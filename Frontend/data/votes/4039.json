Livingston Avenue in Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio.  The 3.1 acre site at 1826 E. Livingston Avenue underwent a Phase 1 and Phase 2 environmental assessment which found chemicals of concern due to underground storage tank systems, chemicals of concern due to former dry cleaner operations on the site, and chemicals of concern concentrations in soil above Ohio EPA Voluntary Action Program standards for residential land use.  \n \nThe 3.1-acre property consists of one large parcel, 010-076843, with one existing building.  The Developer is proposing to demolish the existing building in order to access soil contaminated with hazardous substances as indicated in Phase I and Phase II environmental assessments.\n \nWoda Cooper Companies, Inc. is proposing to redevelop the site with approximately 118 apartment units, including 112 affordable housing units and 5,449 sq. ft. of retail along East Livingston Avenue.  The project is estimated to have a value of $40,000,000 when completed.  Woda Cooper Companies, Inc. is ready to move forward with the project upon award of Brownfield Remediation grant funding and securing a reservation of low-income housing tax credits.  \n \nEmergency action is necessary in order to meet Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation round 3 grant application deadline of July 1, 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There are no costs to the City of Columbus associated with a resolution of support for the Brownfield Remediation Program grant funding, \n \nTitle\nTo resolve to support Franklin County, in partnership with Woda Cooper Companies, Inc., in their efforts to obtain Ohio Department of Development Brownfield Remediation grant funding for use in the environmental cleanup and redevelopment of the 1826 E.
