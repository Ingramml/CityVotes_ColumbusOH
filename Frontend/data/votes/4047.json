    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Greater Columbus Convention & Visitor’s Bureau dba Experience Columbus, in an amount up to $250,000.00, for the Diversity Apprenticeship program. \n \nPrior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Columbus, Ohio leisure and hospitality workforce consisted of 73% white, 16% black, 5.6% Asian, and 5.9% Hispanic employees.  As the travel industry begins to recover from the effects of the pandemic, the diversity levels remain stagnant and the need to create a more inclusive workforce, as well as the need for more leadership opportunities for minorities in this industry, has emerged.  The Diversity Apprenticeship program is designed to address these issues by providing participants hands on, on-the-job experience working across multiple departments (i.e., marketing, sales, finance, etc.) in travel industry organizations.  The program will position the apprentice for long-term professional success in a leadership capacity in the travel industry.  \n \nSupport of this initiative aligns with Columbus City Council’s priorities of building strong neighborhoods, promoting the creation of good-paying jobs, and developing pathways out of poverty.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow program services designed to increase employment opportunities for historically marginalized communities without delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Fund will be transferred from the General Fund Citywide Account to the Department of Development General Fund budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006014 and renewal is pending.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement with Greater Columbus Convention & Visitor’s Bureau, dba Experience Columbus, in an amount up to $250,000.00, for the provision of the Diversity Apprenticeship program; to authorize a transfer with the General Fund in an amount up to $250,000.00; to authorize an expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
