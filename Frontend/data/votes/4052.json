    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe following ordinance accepts a Director’s Deed from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) in connection to ODOT’s Interstate 70/71, Phase 2E project; to quitclaim, at no cost, the fee title ownership of a portion of property to Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH); and, to dedicate and name the remaining property as City road right-of-way.\n \nThe Department of Public Service (DPS) is currently engaged in a project identified as Roadway Improvements - I-70/71 East Interchange Phase 2E project.  This project, as part of the ODOT led 70/71 Phase 2E project, re-aligned a portion of Mooberry Street further to the north, between Parsons Avenue and 18th Street, in order to align Mooberry Street with the new I-70 eastbound exit ramp to Parsons Avenue.  This realignment of Mooberry Street has created residual property.\n \nODOT, owner of  Limited Access Easements, has transferred all of its rights for a 2.158+/- acre tract of property described as AREA “A”, attached hereto, at no cost to the City and reestablished the location for the limitation of access restrictions along the north side of the realigned Mooberry Street.  This transfer is recorded under instrument number 202205180076025, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.  \n \nDPS received a request from Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) that a 1.010 acre portion, described as AREA “B”, attached hereto, be transferred to NCH, subject to the reservation of easement rights for existing utilities.  NCH plans to use this property, when combined with other property it currently owns, to develop another medical tower in connection to the hospital on the NCH campus.  The Department of Public Service supports the waiving of Land Review Commission requirements for this transfer.                     \n \nFrom time to time, parcels of land are deeded to the City of Columbus for public street and/or alley purposes. Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03 requires that property proposed for use as a public street or alley must be accepted and dedicated as public right-of-way by an ordinance specifically passed for such purpose. The remaining portion of property received from ODOT will be dedicated as road right-of-way as Mooberry Street and Parsons Avenue.\n \n2.
