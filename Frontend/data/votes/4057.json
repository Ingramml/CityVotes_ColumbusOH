    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson to add additional funds for design of the UIRF - South Linden Sidewalks 2017 project.  \nOrdinance 2993-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson for the UIRF - South Linden Sidewalks 2017 project.  The intent of this contrct was to provide the Department of Public Service with continuing, contractual access to additional resources that are necessary to perform various professional engineering, surveying, and technical expertise for the department to implement projects for the Department of Development through the City’s Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) program.  \n \nOrdinance 0011-2019 modified the contract in the amount of $21,319.87.  This was an unplanned modification.  Prior to issuing the contract it was necessary to estimate the number of driveways that would not be in compliance with a pedestrian accessible route (PAR).  The survey work performed by Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson as part of the contract showed more driveways out of compliance with PAR than originally estimated, requiring more design work than planned.  In addition, post-construction stormwater Best Management Practices have to be located outside of the existing right-of-way, requiring additional survey and design expenses.  \n \nOrdinance 1371-2020 modified the contract in the amount of $40,018.23.  This was an unplanned modification.  Survey results revealed many driveway grades needed adjustment out of the public right-of-way, resulting in a need for right-of-way plans.  Survey results also revealed that driveway approaches at eight locations partially accessed two parcels when they should access only one parcel, requiring additional design work.  \n   \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $37,564.57.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $148,287.41                     (PO096157, Ord. 2993-2017)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                        $21,319.87                     (PO162111, Ord. 0011-2019) \nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                          $40,018.23                     (PO242061, Ord. 1371-2020)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                                      $37,564.57                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $247,190.08  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson.\n \n2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification.  Roadway standards require four foot shoulder and stormwater facilities in the shoulder must be relocated.  This relocation affects stormwater calculations, construction plans and right of way documents.  Verification of property owners is required due to the length of time since the design commenced.  This was not identified until the Stage 3 plan was submitted for review.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson is CC009015 and expired on 2/15/20.  Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson will be contract compliant before the ordinance is read at council.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $37,564.57 needed for the contract modification is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704.  An amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.  \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent delays in the project schedule.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to modify the contract with Johnson, Mirmiran & Thompson in connection with the UIRF - South Linden Sidewalks 2017 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $37,564.57 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project;
