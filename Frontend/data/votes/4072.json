The County is also adding a new trail deck along the south side of the new bridge, from Sunbury Road to the Kipp School Campus. This will provide new east-west connectivity for the neighborhood. The project is set to begin construction in the summer of 2022. All contract administration and construction inspection will be handled by the County.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nFranklin County Engineer’s Office\n970 Dublin Road\nColumbus, OH  43215\nBarbara Cox, (614) 525-3030\nGovernment Agency\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the County has bid the project and construction is set to begin in the summer of 2022.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The project will provide increased access for thousands of residents to the Alum Creek Trail by providing access to a large school campus as well as a completion of a bike path along Agler Road to Sunbury Road.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The County did public engagement with the surrounding community and stakeholders in 2019 and 2020.   \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northeast (41)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by providing safe and easy access to trails and greenways corridors.\n \nFiscal Impact: $413,173.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contribution.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a construction reimbursement agreement with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office for the Agler Road Trail Connector Project; to authorize the transfer of $413,173.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $413,173.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
