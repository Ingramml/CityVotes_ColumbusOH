    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD) Roof Replacements, No. 2 Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 650234-100100.\n \nThe professional engineering for under this project includes the planning and design of roof systems on several DOSD facilities.  The original ordinance stated an agreement plus four contract renewals were anticipated.  To date, six DOSD facility roofing systems have been designed.  \n \nRenewal No. 4 (current) is intended to include Step 3 Services During Construction for the 2023 roofing system replacements for the following facilities:\n \nJPWWTP: DC3 and DC4\nSWWTP: WPC and WPA\nSMOC Phase VI Vehicle Storage Area Addition\n \nThe Community Planning Area for this project is “99 - Citywide” since the DOSD facilities are across the City.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $180,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $200,850.00                     (PO143499)\nRenewal No. 1:                     $415,000.00                     (PO189219)\nRenewal No. 2:                     $415,000.00                     (PO257821)\nRenewal No. 3:                     $375,000.00                     (PO302773)\nRenewal No. 4 (current):                     $180,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Rens.)                     $1,585,850.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nDue to the highly complex and technical nature of this wastewater treatment plant infrastructure project, it is not reasonable or cost efficient to undertake a new procurement effort to acquire these services. The lengthy process for initiating a new procurement, and for a new entity to gain understanding of the project, would likely cause an unacceptable project delay and additional cost.\n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe cost of the renewal was determined by cost analysis of prior DOSD roof replacement projects. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe performance of this project’s work activities to address replacement and repair of DOSD roofs and roofing components will prevent process equipment, electrical components and other interior furnishings and equipment from moisture damage.  Replacement costs of items due to failed roofing systems could become a major impact to the budget. No community outreach or environmental factors are considered for this project.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  13-6094431, expires 3/8/24, Majority, DAX No. 25646.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc.\n \n4. FUTURE CONTRACT MODIFICATION(S):  This is the final renewal to the agreement.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT: There are sufficient funds and budgetary authority within the Sewer G.O. Bonds Fund - Fund No. 6109 for this expenditure.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD) Roof Replacements, No. 2 Project; for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage; and to authorize an expenditure up to $180,000.00 within the Sewer General Obligations Bond Fund.
