    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Basement Authority for the Volunteer Sump Pump Program - Blueprint North Linden 1, Phase 2 Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 650876-111191, for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage.  \n \nWork under the original contract included sump pump installation in properties in the North Linden 1 area.  \n \nModification No. 1 (current) is being requested to extend the contract timeline and to expand the scope of work allowing sump pump installation in properties outside the North Linden 1 area.\n \nUpdated Planning Area:  99 - Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $0.00*\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $1,852,944.83                     (PO188338)  \nModification No. 1 (current):                     $              0.00 \nTotal (Orig. + Mod 1):                     $1,852,944.83 \n \n*Funds will be used from the available balance under PO188338.\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis modification will allow contract work to be performed outside of the Linden 1 area.  Since the Department is under a mandate from Ohio EPA to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows and basement back-ups, it behooves us to use remaining funds on the current contract to address issues in other areas without adding the additional expense of soliciting new proposals.  Ohio Basement Authority was the sole bidder under the original solicitation and the Department is satisfied with the quality of their work.  \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nSolicitation of new proposals would result in significant loss of time and project knowledge.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThis is a no-cost modification; remaining funds on PO188338 will be used for the expanded scope.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe Department of Public Utilities is under a mandate from Ohio EPA to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows and basement back-ups.  The sump pumps being installed are designed to reduce residential backups in the impacted area(s).\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  38-3823702, (in process of being updated), MAJ, DAX No. 15314\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Ohio Basement Authority.\n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT:  This is a no-cost modification; remaining funds on PO188338 will be used for the expanded scope.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Basement Authority, for the Volunteer Sump Pump Program - Blueprint North Linden 1, Phase 2 Project; for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage.  ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO188338 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1769-2019, passed July 22, 2019, was executed on August 26, 2019, and approved by the City Attorney on August 28, 2019, for the Volunteer Sump Pump Program - Blueprint North Linden 1, Phase 2 Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 1 (current) is needed to extend the contract timeline and to expand the scope of work allowing sump pump installation in properties outside the North Linden 1 area.; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Basement Authority for the  Volunteer Sump Pump Program - Blueprint North Linden 1, Phase 2 Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage & Drainage, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Basement Authority, for the Volunteer Sump Pump Program - Blueprint North Linden 1, Phase 2 Project, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; Now, Therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized and directed to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Basement Authority, FID #38-3823702, 2421 McGaw Rd., Obetz, Oh 43207; for the Volunteer Sump Pump Program - Blueprint North Linden 1, Phase 2 Project.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this Modification is in compliance with Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes.  This is the sole modification to the contract.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this Ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project account by monies from more than one source.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
