    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the existing professional engineering services agreement with Black & Veatch Corporation, for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage’s Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF) Upgrade, General Program #4 Project, CIP No. 650360-100002. \n \nThis agreement will provide Overall Engineering Consultant (OEC) Services for said project.  OEC services include providing technical and engineering assistance to the City and its design professionals in planning and coordination of the work.  Additional information relating to project tasks can be found on the attachment “ORD 1752-2022”.\n \nModification No. 2 (current) is unplanned and needed to provide funding for two new projects:  the newly announced Intel facility and the existing CEPT treatment system at Southerly.  (The CEPT system at Southerly requires a detailed treatment effectiveness study as a part of the new Ohio EPA NPDES permit that became effective January 2022).\n \nCommunity Planning Area: 99 - Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $500,000.00\nOriginal Contract                     $1,000,000 PO034617\nModification #1                     $1,000,000 PO095735\nRenewal #1                              $1,000,000 PO153882\nRenewal # 2                             $1,609,900 PO209574\nRenewal # 3                            $1,000,000 PO264043\nRenewal # 4                      $1,000,000 PO308100\nModification #2 (current)                     $500,000 (current)\nCURRENT PROPOSED TOTAL                     $7,109,900\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nA modification of funds for the 6th year of the 6-year agreement was planned, however, work under this modification is unplanned due to two new projects mentioned above.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original agreement was set up as a 6-year effort funded by annual renewals as it includes tasks that stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them.  Bidding out this work would risk funding this substantial startup effort again, and would require the multi-year work to start again at the beginning. \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by Black & Veatch Corporation, reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, and was deemed acceptable.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe project provides many metrics on various environmental factors that are noted in the work to be performed.  The information provided assists and guides the City in decision making on environmental issues.  These decisions have a direct impact on the capital improvement program budget amounts and scheduling to address the environmental needs.  No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  43-1833073 | MAJ | Exp. 9/2/2023| Vendor # 008038\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) produced no findings Black & Veatch Corporation.\n \n4. FUTURE RENEWAL/MODIFICATION(S):  This modification funds the 6th year of the 6 year agreement.  The expiration date of this agreement is December 2022, however, work performed during 2022 may extend into 2023 (using previously authorized funds).\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT:  A transfer of funds within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund - Fund No. 6109 will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Black & Veatch Corporation, for the Division of Sewerage & Drainage’s Wastewater Treatment Facilities Upgrade, General Program #4 Project; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $500,000.00 within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget.
