    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Osborn Engineering for the Division of Water (DOW) Safety Improvements Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690578-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2206.\n \nWork performed to date was for preliminary design services assessing the Division of Water’s safety needs, evaluating adequate safety solutions, and prioritization for implementation.\n \nModification No. 1 (current) will design safety improvements using applicable guidelines and practices at various DOW facilities to prepare a set of bid documents for subsequent installation. Safety improvements may include but are not limited to modification / installation of guardrails, ladders, fall protection systems, signage, and machine guarding.\n \nThe Community Planning Area for this project is “99 - Citywide” since work will be performed throughout multiple community planning areas.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $400,025.00\nOriginal Agreement Amount:                     $219,300.00  (PO261485) \nModification No. 1 (current):                     $400,205.00 \nTotal (Orig. + Mod 1):                     $619,325.00\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nOrdinance No. 2835-2020 indicated two (2) modifications to the agreement would be needed for detailed design & bidding services and Engineering Services During Construction.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was anticipated to be funded in phases as indicated in the original request for proposals and legislation under Ordinance No. 2835-2020. Osborn Engineering is familiar with the details of the project and has compiled a Basis of Design Report detailing their findings and recommendations. The process of selecting and contracting with a new consultant team to review documents prepared by Osborn Engineering would delay the project and increase engineering and construction costs.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nCost proposals were provided by Osborn Engineer, reviewed by the Division of Water, and deemed acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project will address miscellaneous safety needs at various Division of Water facilities which will improve employee working conditions and reduce the potential for employee injuries.  Most improvements will occur within secure areas that are not accessible to the public; for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for improvements that occur within areas accessible to the public, but at this time, outreach is not expected to be needed.  The consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying DPU’s environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  34-0445030, expires 10/15/23, MAJ, DAX No. 6417\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Osborn Engineering.\n \n4. FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  Modification No. 2 (future) will be needed for Engineering Services During Construction.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT:  A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund - Fund No. 6006 will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Osborn Engineering for the Division of Water (DOW) Safety Improvements Project; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $400,025.00 within the Water General Obligation Bonds Fund; and to amend the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget.  ($400,025.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO261485 was authorized by Ordinance No. 2835-2020, passed February 1, 2021, was executed on March 3, 2021, and approved by the City Attorney on March 5, 2021, for the Division of Water (DOW) Safety Improvements Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 1 (current) is needed for detailed design and bidding services; and \n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 2 (future) will be needed for Engineering Services During Construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Osborn Engineering for DOW Safety Improvements Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a transfer and expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
