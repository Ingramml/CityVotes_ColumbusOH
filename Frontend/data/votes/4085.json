The WRRSP provided funding for the Lower Olentangy River Ecosystem Restoration (5th Ave. Dam Removal & Riparian Restoration - CIP 650706; WRRSP No. WR390274-0150) Public Project (“Public Project”).

The Covenant’s second amendment was recorded on May 23, 2017, which is described and recorded in the public land records in Instrument Number 201705230069092 (“Second Amendment”). \n \nPursuant to Section 10 of the Covenant, OSU has requested the Covenant be amended in order to replace Exhibit B Addendum 2 of the Second Amendment to address current and future encumbrances within the conservation limits, including a new proposed sanitary sewer CIP 650902-100000 Clinton Sewer District Number 3 Trunk Sewer Siphon Upgrade (CC-19496). Furthermore, the Department of Public Utilities also reviewed OSU’s request to amend the Covenant and determined that amending the Covenant is appropriate.
