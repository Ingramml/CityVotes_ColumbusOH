    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project.\n \nThe HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and future availability of funds.  The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing $1,250,000.00 of bond funds from the 2022 Capital Budget.  This legislation would authorize the Director of the Department of Development to first execute the HDA.  Council approval to execute a bond grant agreement contributing 2022 bond funds will occur at a later date.  \n \nMcKinley Manor is a single-phase development to occur on a multi-parcel former commercial site that is bounded by existing housing on two adjacent sides and the City of Columbus Fire Station and EMS Station 10. The project is within steps of COTA bus stops, a United Dairy Farms store, Bottoms Up Coffee, several restaurants, houses of worship, Jubilee Market Grocery, and Lower Lights Pharmacy.\n \nThe property will be mixed-income, featuring low income age-restricted senior housing accommodating senior households (55+) with incomes ranging from 60% AMI and below. The project also intends to have all forty four (44) one-bedroom housing units with Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance to target housing needs in the community for housing people with multiple entry barriers including the elderly, persons with disabilities, chronically mentally ill, and homeless individuals and families.\n \nMcKinley Manor is working with the YMCA to receive their Permanent Supportive Housing funds from the downtown YMCA with a commitment that McKinley Manor will take the qualified tenants from the downtown YMCA location.  LifeCare Alliance is providing the transportation needed to make this possible. \n \nAll apartments will have at least one (1) full bathroom. Over 5% of the project units will be fully accessible and at least one (1) unit for hearing/vision impaired residents. All of the units will be “Visit-Able” with a zero-step entrance and widths/clearances acceptable to accommodating residents and visitors with wheelchairs, walkers, and other mobility-assisting devices, as well as featuring elements of Universal Design promoting “aging in place.”\n \nThe McKinley Manor project will provide select specialized coordination of supportive support and especially to seniors to enhance residents’ ability to maintain independence and tenancy. The site amenities will include a campus setting with adequate lighting and parking, main entry driveway access, community recreation areas and garden-style units. The building amenities include elevator, common laundry, on-site property management and tenant service coordinator offices, ample tenant storage, men’s and women’s rest rooms and even an exercise room.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  no funding needed at this time\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006216 and expires 10/22/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development seeks to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project; and\n \nWHEREAS, the HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and future availability of funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing $1,250,000.00 of bond funds from the 2022 Capital Budget and executing a bond grant agreement at a later date; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development requiring to pass this ordinance as emergency in order to maintain the project schedule, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
