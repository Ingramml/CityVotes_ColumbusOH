    "title": "To authorize and direct the Municipal Court Clerk to modify and extend the contract with Voicecast Systems, Inc. for the Short Message Service; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Background:  This legislation authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (hereinafter \"Municipal Court Clerk\") to modify and extend the existing contract with Voicecast Systems, Inc., dba InTouch Connections, for one month for the provision of Short Message Service(s) (hereinafter SMS). \nThe additional time is needed to transfer the SMS to the new vendor. The new contract (PO322330) commenced May 1, 2022.\nThe SMS provides defendants with an automated courtesy text reminder of their scheduled court appearance.  In Franklin County Municipal Court, there are an overabundance of individuals who fail to appear for court; resulting in the issuance of order-ins and warrants.  Most warrants issued are for low level misdemeanors, creating a clog in the system, and increasing workloads for all justice system partners.\nStudies suggest that using the SMS improves court appearance rates of defendants and reduce community and operational court costs associated with failure to appear.  In addition, defendants may spend less time in jail.\n \nBid Information:\nIn 2021 an informal bid process was solicited through RFQ018273.  One bid was received: Voicecast Systems Inc The Municipal Court Clerk awarded the bid to Voicecast Systems, Inc. \n \nContract: \n2021 Original Contract - PO269335; $30,000.00 \nContract Compliance Number:  36-4480537    \nExpiration Date: 11/16/2022\nVendor#: 025677\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funds are required.\n \nEmergency:  Emergency legislation is requested for the continuity of the SMS as the additional time is needed to transfer the SMS to the new vendor.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Municipal Court Clerk to modify and extend the contract with Voicecast Systems, Inc. for the Short Message Service; and to declare an emergency. \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Municipal Court Clerk's Office has a need to modify and extend the existing contract with Voicecast Systems, Inc. for the provision of the SMS for one month; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Municipal Court Clerk's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Municipal Court Clerkto modify the contract with Voicecast Systems, Inc. in order to maintain continuity of the SMS and for additional time to transfer the SMS to the new vendor; for the preservation of the public peace, health, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.  That the Municipal Court Clerk is authorized and directed to modify and extend the existing contract for one month with Voicecast Systems, Inc. for the continuity of the SMS for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure, which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approved by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
