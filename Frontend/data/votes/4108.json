    "description": "Explanation\n \nColumbus Public Health has been awarded additional funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  This ordinance is needed to accept the additional funding of $702,147.00 in grant monies for the Healthy Start grant program for the period of April 1, 2022 through March, 31, 2023. This ordinance also authorizes a contract with Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers for $275,000.00, for the provision of advanced clinical prenatal and postpartum services to high-risk Healthy Start clients for the period of July 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. \n \nThese services were advertised through Bonfire (RFQ021897) according to bidding requirements of the City Code. Heart of Ohio Family Health Center’s contract compliance number is CC-007697 and it expires 10/7/2022. The reason they were selected is because to best serve our clients, advanced clinical services which Heart of Ohio provides can be integrated into the client's primary OB care team, instead of the limited supplementary clinical services Health's internal staff would be able to provide.  Heart of Ohio Family Health Center is a non-profit entity.\n \nG502210 will be increased by $702,147.00, making the total Healthy Start grant award $1,144,121.00. \n \nThe Healthy Start grant program enables Columbus Public Health to conduct care coordination in the project area neighborhoods of Franklin County, focusing primarily on perinatal and infant clients and their families.  The goal of the program is to improve perinatal delivery systems in the project communities.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to not delay services to clients and their families and to allow the financial transactions to be posted in the City’s accounting system as soon as possible.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Healthy Start grant program is entirely funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and does not generate revenue or require a City match.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept additional funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the amount of $702,147.00; to authorize the appropriation of $702,147.00 to the Health Department in the Health Department Grants Fund; to authorize the Board of Health to enter into a non-profit service contract with Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers for the provision of advanced clinical prenatal and postpartum services to high-risk Healthy Start clients; to authorize the expenditure of $275,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency ($702,147.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $702,147.00 in additional grant funds have been made available through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the Healthy Start grant program for the period of April 1, 2022 through March, 31, 2023; and, \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the continued support of the Healthy Start grant program; \n \nWHEREAS,                     it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $275,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund; nd\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary that the Board of Health enters into a non-profit service contract, pursuant to City Code Section 329.30, with Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers for the provision of advanced clinical prenatal and postpartum services to high-risk Healthy Start clients for the period of July 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and,\n \nWHEREAS,                     an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Department Health and to appropriate these funds to Columbus Public Health for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare, and to avoid delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept additional funding of $702,147.00 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the Healthy Start grant program for the period of April 1, 2022 through March, 31, 2023.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department's Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources during the grant period, the sum of $702,147.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated to the Health Department, Division No. 5001, according to the attached accounting document.\n \nSECTION 3.  To authorize the Board of Health to enter into a non-profit service contract, pursuant to City Code Section 329.30, with Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers for the provision of advanced clinical prenatal and postpartum services to high-risk Healthy Start clients for the period of July 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023. \n \nSECTION 4.
