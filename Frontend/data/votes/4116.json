    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University Foundation in support of the Columbus Transportation Leadership Endowment Fund.  The purpose of the endowment is to provide one or more scholarships to undergraduate students who are majoring in the field of engineering from the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering.  As a part of the grant agreement, the City desires that when awarding these scholarships special consideration be given to candidates who are members of organizations recognized by the University that are open to all and whose missions seek to advance the need of historically underserved populations in the field of engineering such as the Minority Engineering Program and Women in Engineering.\n \nThe Ohio State University’s mission and admissions policy supports educational diversity. The University may modify any criteria used to select scholarship recipients should the criteria be found, in whole or in part, to be contrary to federal or state law or University policy.\n \nScholarship recipients, the number of recipients, and amount of each scholarship shall be determined in accordance with the then current guidelines and procedures for scholarship administration established by the College, in consultation with Student Financial Aid and the College’s office of Diversity, Outreach & Inclusion.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis is a one-time cash grant for a total of $150,000 and funding is available within the Department of Public Service Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair fund.   These Funds are eligible to be included in the Scarlet & Gray Advantage Endowed Matching Program (“Matching Program”). Under the Matching Program, any endowed grant of at least $100,000 that supports undergraduate scholarships and assists with the cost of attendance is eligible to receive matching funds from the University.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nContract compliance is not applicable to this transaction as the City is not making a purchase.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION  \nEmergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University Foundation as soon as possible so the grant funds are available for use for the upcoming academic year.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University Foundation in support of the Columbus Transportation Leadership Endowment Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 within the Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair Fund; to authorize the return of any funds that may be unused; and to declare an emergency.  ($150,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University Foundation in support of the Columbus Transportation Leadership Endowment Fund; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the purpose of the endowment is to provide one or more scholarships to undergraduate students who are majoring in the field of engineering from the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the City desires that when awarding these scholarships special consideration be given to candidates who are members of organizations recognized by the University that are open to all and whose missions seek to advance the need of historically underserved populations in the field of engineering such as the Minority Engineering Program and Women in Engineering; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this is a one-time cash grant with a total cost of  $150,000 and funding is available within the Department of Public Service Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair fund; and,\n \nWHEREAS, these Funds are eligible to be included in the Scarlet & Gray Advantage Endowed Matching Program (“Matching Program”); and, \n \nWHEREAS, under the Matching Program, any endowed grant of at least $100,000 that supports undergraduate scholarships and assists with the cost of attendance is eligible to receive matching funds from the University; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University Foundation so the grant funds are available for use for the upcoming academic year, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University Foundation in support of the Columbus Transportation Leadership Endowment Fund.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $150,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized in Fund 2265 (Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair Fund), Dept-Div 5901 (Director’s Office), Object Class 63050 (Professional Services), per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service is authorized to accept the return of any grant funds not used by The Ohio State University Foundation.\n \nSECTION 4.   That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
