This equipment is located throughout the facilities associated with DPU’s sewage and storm water collection systems and water distribution system, including at the two (2) Wastewater Treatment Plants, Compost Facility, Sewer Maintenance Operations Center, and three (3) Water Treatment Plants. The equipment is also located at various electric substations that service the City of Columbus and its satellite communities.  \n \nThe work performed under the current contract is for electric power distribution systems and their components that require inspection, testing, maintenance, and repair or replacement, with the majority of the work for industrial equipment and systems ranging from 120V to 15.5 kV. The contract also covers inspection, testing, maintenance, and repair or replacement work on equipment and systems >15.5 kV to 138 kV that requires a contractor or subcontractor with highly specialized experience in high voltage equipment.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities advertised Request for Proposals for the subject services in the City Bulletin in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code. Two hundred and two (202) vendors were solicited (RFQ10714), and four (4) proposals were received and opened on November 7, 2018.
