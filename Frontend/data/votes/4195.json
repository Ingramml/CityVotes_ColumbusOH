Rev1 Ventures, formerly known as TechColumbus, is a not for profit seed stage venture development organization that combines investment capital and strategic services to help entrepreneurs build products that people want and companies that succeed.  Rev1 Ventures led a successful regional proposal to the State of Ohio to secure $18.7 million for the Entrepreneurial Signature Program (ESP) which accelerates the creation and growth of new technology companies in Central Ohio. The ESP Program includes early stage capital to meet the needs for pre-seed capital for Ohio start-up technology companies. A 1-to-2 funding match was required as a condition of the ESP Program.
