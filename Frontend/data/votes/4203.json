    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify contracts with FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. for the purchase of four single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks with snow equipment and one pothole patching truck for the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management.\n \nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management, is responsible for maintaining Columbus roadways. This includes filling potholes, street sweeping, mowing, alley resurfacing, and snow and ice removal.  Ordinance 2917-2021 authorized the purchase of two single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks with snow and ice equipment for the purpose of maintaining the roads.    Ordinance 3201-2021 authorized the purchase of one pothole patching truck for the purpose of maintaining the roads.  The City has a multiple year Universal Term Contract established for live body dump trucks with FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc.  \n \nAfter ordinances 2917-2021 and 3201-2021 authorized the purchase of two single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks with snow and ice equipment and one pothole patching truck, FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to supply chain and labor issues beyond their control, a surcharge of $2,900.00 per truck for 2021 orders was necessary to build the trucks. Ordinance 0553-2022 authorized the Director of Finance and Management to modify the existing contract for the purchase of two single and three tandem axle live body trucks to add the surcharge of $2,900.00 per truck, for total surcharges of $14,500.00.  Ordinance 0218-2022 amended ordinance 3201-2021 and authorized the surcharge of $2,900.00 for one pothole patching truck for the purpose of maintaining the roads.  \n \nOrdinance 0679-2022 authorized the purchase of two single axle live body dump trucks with snow and ice equipment for the purpose of maintaining the roads.  This order included an increase in pricing, so a surcharge of $2,900.00 for the two trucks was not necessary. \n \nAfter ordinances 0553-2022 and 0218-2022 authorizing surcharges and ordinance 0679-2022 authorizing purchasing two single live body dump trucks were passed and associated purchase orders were created, FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to additional supply chain and labor issues beyond their control, additional surcharges of $2,800.00 per truck were necessary to build the eight trucks. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify the existing contracts to add the surcharges of $2,800.00 per truck, totaling $22,400.00 for the eight trucks. The Department feels these changes are acceptable and the vehicles offered by FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. will meet the needs of the Department.   \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are budgeted and available for this expenditure from the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund (Fund 2266). \n \n3. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe department requests emergency designation so this equipment can be put into service as quickly as possible to prevent interruption to, or disruption of, the Division of Infrastructure Management operations. \n \nTitle \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Department of Public Service, to modify contracts with FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. to allow for raw material and labor surcharges of $2,800.00 for eight trucks; to authorize the expenditure of up to $22,400.00 from the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund; and to declare an emergency.   ($22,400.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Infrastructure Management, has a need for four single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks with snow equipment and one pothole patching truck; and\n \nWHEREAS, ordinance 2917-2021 authorized the purchase of and payment for the two single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks; and \n \nWHEREAS, ordinance 3201-2021 authorized the purchase of and payment for one pothole patching truck; and \n \nWHEREAS, after ordinances 2917-2021 and 3201-2021 were passed, FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to supply chain and labor issues beyond their control, a raw materials and labor surcharge of $2,900.00 per truck was necessary to build the trucks; and\n \nWHEREAS, ordinances 0553-2022 and 0218-2022 authorized the Director of Finance and Management to add the surcharges of $2,900.00 per truck; and\n \nWHEREAS, ordinance 0679-2022 authorized the purchase of and payment for two single axle live body dump trucks; and \n \nWHEREAS, after ordinances 0553-2022, 0218-2022, and 0679-2022 were passed, FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. notified the Director of Finance and Management that due to continued supply chain and labor issues beyond their control, an additional raw materials and labor surcharge of $2,800.00 per truck for eight existing truck orders was necessary to build the trucks; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department feels the surcharge of $2,800.00 per truck offered by FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. is acceptable and the trucks will meet the needs of the Department; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the contracts with FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. to add a surcharge of $2,800.00 per truck for eight existing truck orders; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $22,400.00 with FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. for the raw material and labor surcharges for the eight trucks; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the contracts for four single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks with snow equipment and one pothole patching truck and pay the additional surcharges so this equipment can be put into service as quickly as possible to prevent interruption to, or disruption of, the Division of Infrastructure Management operations, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify the contracts with FYDA Freightliner Columbus, Inc. for four single axle and three tandem axle live body dump trucks with snow and ice equipment and one pothole patching truck for the purpose of adding the surcharges of $2,800.00 per truck, for total surcharges of $22,400.00.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $22,400.00, or as much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized in Fund 2266 (the Municipal Motor Vehicle Tax Fund), Dept-Div 5911 (Division of Infrastructure Management) in Object Class 06 (Vehicles) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project. \n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
