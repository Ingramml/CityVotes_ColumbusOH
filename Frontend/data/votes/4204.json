Fulton Street that is owned by Hebron, Inc.  It runs north / south directionally and is between Oakwood Avenue to the east and Glover Alley to the west.  The portion totals 0.015 acres. \n \nSale of this right-of-way will allow it to be incorporated into the parcel already owned by Hebron, Inc., to provide better usability to the owner.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to sell the right-of-way as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way is needed, and the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $975.00 was established.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on February 21, 2019.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Hebron, Inc. at the cost of $975.00.\n \n2.
