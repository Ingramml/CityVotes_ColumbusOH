    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND: The Short Circuit, Coordination, and Arc Flash Studies #1 Project (CIP 650260-100008) provides engineering services for short circuit, coordination, and arc flash mitigation. This work includes field collection of all device and component ratings, settings, sizes, lengths, etc.; development of a model and providing the coordination settings to reduce incident arc flash energy. This includes affixing arc flash hazard labels to all equipment as required by OSHA.\n \nDuring this renewal period the project will provide continuing support in these areas for all capital projects at the wastewater treatment plants, compost, and the pump stations. This will include reviewing short circuit analysis from other Design Professionals and integrating these models into the overall plant models.  The engineer will also provide services to recommend changes to electrical gear to improve short circuit coordination and arc flash behavior, including making setting changes on equipment.\nCommunity Planning Area 99: Citywide. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $ 350,000.00\nOriginal Contract (PO152940) $1,000,000.00\nRenewal 1 (PO 257092) $ 425,000.00\nRenewal 2 (current) $ 350,000.00\nRenewal 3 (anticipated 2023) $ 350,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL $2,125,000.00\n \nReasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThis is a planned contract renewal and the additional services were identified in the original contract ordinance, Ord. 2777-2018.\n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis work was originally planned as a four year effort funded by annual renewals because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them. Bidding out this work would risk funding this substantial start up effort again and would require the multi-year work to start again.\n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe costs were negotiated with Hatch Associates Consultants Inc., reviewed by the Division of\nSewerage, and Drainage and were deemed acceptable.\n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: This is the second planned renewal of a multi-year contract. This is anticipated to be a 4 year contract with annual renewals. Adjustments to fees and scope will be made by contract renewal based on annual (or semiannual) proposals as requested by the City. The expected end date of the contract is first quarter 2023, but the duration of the contract may extend into subsequent years based on the complexity and progress of the assigned work.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER: 13-6094431 | MAJ | Exp. 3/8/2024 | Vendor #\n025646\n \nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT: This project will provide a safer working environment for plant personnel by updating arc flash rating nameplates required by OSHA and will reduce nuisance tripping of electrical equipment.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to of $350,000.00 from the\nSanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing contract with Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. for the Short Circuit, Coordination, and Arc Flash Studies #1 Project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $350,000.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation (G.O.)
