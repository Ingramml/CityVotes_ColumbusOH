    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Dam Engineering Services Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690555-100000, for Division of Water Contract No. 2136.\n \nThis is a “task order” type of agreement to augment existing engineering personnel within the Water Supply Group, Division of Water on an as-authorized, as needed basis for Dam Engineering Services.  \n \nTasks completed under the original agreement (PO285982) included:\n1.                     Creating new inundation maps for the O’Shaughnessy Dam Emergency Action Plan.\n2.                     Annual alignment survey for O’Shaughnessy Dam-special detailed level of accuracy required.\n3.                     Update of EAP for O’Shaughnessy Dam following the Tabletop and Functional Exercises performed under a separate contract.\n4.                     Inspection of the stop logs for Hoover Dam.\n \nPotential Tasks to be completed under Contract Renewal No. 1 (current) include*:\n1.                     Inspection of concrete barrier (plug) at mouth of McKinley Quarry. If needed and if authorized, design improvements based on results of inspection.                     \n2.                     Alignment survey of Hoover & Griggs Dam.\n3.   Independent Consultant (IC) Inspection Griggs Dam\n4.                     Following the completion of the IC inspection of Griggs Dam update the Griggs Operation, Maintenance & Inspection (OM&I) manual to reflect items identified in the IC inspection\n5.                     Independent Consultant Inspection of Hoover Dam\n6.                     Following the completion of the IC inspection of Hoover Dam update the Hoover OM&I manual to reflect items identified in the IC inspection\n7.                     Update of Emergency Action Plan (EAP) Griggs Dam.                     \n \n*List is may not be inclusive & exhaustive of all projects.\n \nCommunity Planning Area: “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $150,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $150,000.00  (PO285982)\nRenewal 1 (current):                     $150,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal 1):                     $300,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe services were discussed and included in the original RFP. The current consultant has since gained detailed knowledge of the existing facilities and has completed preliminary design elements.  Awarding this work to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the assessments and design work already performed, increasing project costs and extending the project schedule.\n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThis cost was the budgeted amount in the 2020-2025 Capital Improvement Plan.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis agreement is for dam engineering services.  The economic impact is $150,000 for professional services from the capital budget.  This will allow the Division to perform miscellaneous engineering tasks related to the water supply dams on an as-needed basis.  Outreach and environmental impact is unknown since the exact type and location of work is unknown at this time.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  31-0885550, expires 2/9/24, MAJ, DAX No. 4425\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Burgess & Niple, Inc.\n \n4.  FUTURE RENEWAL(S):  One additional renewal to the engineering agreement is anticipated.\n \n5.
