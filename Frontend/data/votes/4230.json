($0)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew (Renewal #3) the professional engineering services agreement with CDM Smith Inc., for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFS) Instrumentation and Control (I&C) Integration and Programming, Part 2 Project, CIP No. 650348-100004. \n \nThis project will provide needed upgrades to the existing Plant Wide Process Control System (PWPCS) at each DOSD facility; provide integration for the newly constructed CIP's into the existing PWPCS at the DOSD Facilities; and provide DOSD Staff training, with the goal that the City staff will become self-reliant to handle all PWPCS issues.  New projects must be integrated into the PWPCS to best maintain the operational performance of the treatment facilities. This project also assists City staff in maintaining and upgrading the PWPCS at Southerly, Jackson Pike, SMOC and Compost.\nNo additional future renewals are anticipated.\n \nPlanning Area: 99 (Citywide)\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $0\nCost summary:\nOriginal Contract $500,000.00\nRenewal 1 $500,000.00\nRenewal 2 $500,000.00\nRenewal 3 $0*\nCurrent Total $1,500,000.00\n \n*Remaining funds are available PO212870 (Renewal 1) and PO280659 (Renewal 2) to cover the work.\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThis was planned contract renewal that extends the completion date to March 28, 2023 to perform additional task ordered work.\n \n1.3 Reasons other procurement processes are not used:\nThis work was originally planned as a 4-year effort funded by annual renewals because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them.\nBidding out this work would risk funding this substantial startup effort again, and would require the multi-year work to start again at the beginning.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThis is a no-cost modification; remaining funds on PO212870 (Renewal 1) and PO280659 (Renewal 2) will be used to cover the cost of the work.\nPROJECT TIMELINE: The original project was initiated as a one year contract, with an option for the City to renew annually for an additional three years. The expected completion date of the contract is 3/28/2023, but the duration of the contract may be extended based on the complexity and progress of the assigned work. This is year four of a four year contract.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NO: 04-2473650 | MAJ | Exp. 10/12/2022 | Vendor #\n000180\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: This contract is essential for maintenance and troubleshooting of PWPCS, as well as integration of new equipment with the control system. The project provides emergency response for troubleshooting of the PWPCS, which will allow more reliable service from the DOSD facilities and help to ensure that the facilities meet environmental permits.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This is a no-cost renewal.   Funds available on the previous renewals will cover the work. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with CDM Smith Inc., for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFS) Instrumentation and Control (I&C) Integration and Programming, Part 2 Project; for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.
