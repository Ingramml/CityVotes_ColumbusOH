($2,500.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify (Modification No. 1) a contract with Consolidated Services and Management to add an escalator clause and funding to permit a fuel surcharge in light of the rising costs of fuel.  \n \nOriginal contract amount                     $  50,000.00                     Ord. 0240-2022                                          PO311083\nModification No. 1 amount                     $    2,500.00\nTotal contract amount                                          $  52,500.00\n \nThe purpose of the Property Maintenance program is to provide services that may include some or all of the following service categories in each assignment:  removal and disposal of trash and debris both inside and outside of structures; light demolition; tree and shrub maintenance and/or removal; and other miscellaneous services.  Most work assigned under this contract shall be removal and disposal of trash and debris for properties held by the Land Redevelopment Division.  \n \nCompanies responded to an Invitation to Bid, RFQ020243 in 2021 and were selected by an evaluation committee as the companies with the best proposals based on prior experience, resources and qualifications. The bids allow the establishment of one year contracts with an option to extend an additional year.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ020243 on Vendor Services in October 2021 for the Property Maintenance program and 13 bids were received.  The Director of Development entered into contract with 10 bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  The contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to February 28, 2023, with an option to renew one additional year, through 2024.   \n \nSince the origination of the agreement with Consolidated Services and Management, fuel costs have risen significantly and have impacted Property Maintenance program providers’ ability to perform services under the contracted fee amounts.  To remedy this unforeseen cost, modification of the original agreement to include an escalator and de-escalator clause for fuel surcharges is necessary.  Without this modification, providers may terminate their current contracts, requiring the City to seek competitive proposals that take the current fuel costs into consideration.  A modification of the current agreements saves the City both the expense and time associated with seeking services from new providers.\n \nThe escalator and de-escalator clauses will allow providers to charge a 5% fuel surcharge to each invoice that covers work completed during a time of high/rising fuel costs.  The de-escalator portion of the modification will eliminate the fuel surcharge if/when fuel costs fall closer in line with costs at the time that the agreement was entered into.\n \nAdditional funds will be added with this modification to cover the fuel surcharge costs.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to provide services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding of $2,500.00 is available in the Land Management Fund (2206).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 012297 and expires 1/3/2024.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Consolidated Services and Management to include an escalator and de-escalator clause for fuel surcharge fees; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $2,500.00; and to declare an emergency. ($2,500.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development has identified the need to modify a contract with Consolidated Services and Management to include an escalator and de-escalator clause for fuel surcharge fees, to increase the contract amount by $2,500.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ020243 on Vendor Services in October 2021 for the Property Maintenance program, 13 bids were received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with 10 bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that this contract extension and modification should be authorized immediately to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development be and is hereby authorized to modify a contract with Consolidated Services and Management to include an escalator and de-escalator clause for fuel surcharge fees.\n \nSECTION 2.
