    "description": "Explanation\n \n“Mac” a canine that has been in service with the Division of Police’s Canine Unit for many years needs to be taken out of service.\n \n“Mac” is a 9 year old, German Shepard, and has been diagnosed with hip dysplasia.  “Mac” can no longer perform many basic police canine functions as he once did and the only treatment for his diagnosis are hip replacement surgery or pain management. Due to these facts it is in the best interest of “Mac” and the Division to take him out of service and retire him.  Retiring “Mac” would keep the Division from paying the additional cost for food and medical expenses with no guarantee that he would be able to perform necessary duties.  \n \nIt is recommended that “Mac” be retired and to permit his handler, Officer Ricky Anderson #1144, to assume custody and care of “Mac” and purchase him from the Division of Police for the sum of $1.00.(ORC 9.62, (C)).  Officer Ricky Anderson #1144 has agreed to accept “Mac”. \n \nAdditionally, the Division of Police Legal Bureau has developed a general release document that relinquishes the City of Columbus from any liability as it relates to the post retirement care and control of “Mac”, and assigns that liability to Officer Ricky Anderson #1144.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAt this time there are plans to replace this canine with a current canine in the Canine Unit.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to sell to Officer Ricky Anderson #1144, for the sum of $1.00, a police canine with the registered name of “Mac” which has no further value to the Division of Police and to waive the provisions of City Code- 329 Sale of City-owned personal property.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, “Mac” has been a Canine Unit canine with the Division of Police for many years; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is recommended “Mac” be retired due to health and pain issues; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to allow this canine to be purchased by Officer Ricky Anderson #1144 for the sum of $1.00; now therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1. That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized and directed to sell the police canine with the registered name of “Mac” to Officer Ricky Anderson #1144 for the sum of $1.00.\n \nSection 2.
