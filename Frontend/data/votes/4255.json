    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Department of Human Resources to modify the existing contract with S&K Design Fitness for fitness equipment maintenance and service for equipment located at the Front Street Fitness Center.  This modification serves to reflect the assignment of a new name from S&K Design Fitness to Design2Wellness and the new firm’s corresponding federal tax ID number (88-1083878).  S&K Design Fitness merged with 123Wellness and started a new company called Design2Wellness, effective June 1, 2022. This modification will reflect a company name change and federal identification number change for the contract and purchase order established with S&K Design Fitness by the Department of Human Resources. \nThe Department of Human Resources is currently mid-year in this contract. The original contract was not legislated due to the low dollar amount of the contract.\nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are required.\nEMERGENCY PROVISION: Emergency action is requested to facilitate uninterrupted services and payments.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Department of Human Resources to modify the contract with S&K Design Fitness and to reflect assignment of that company and a name change to Design2Wellness, and to declare an emergency.
