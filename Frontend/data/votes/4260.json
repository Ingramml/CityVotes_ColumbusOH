The proposed scope of work also will include additional public infrastructure improvements, specifically, a new traffic signal and left turn lanes at the intersection of Agler Road and Wedge Drive and a shared use path along the south side of Agler Road from east of Bridgewalk Street to east of Inspire Drive. The KIPP Columbus Foundation has engaged Smoot Construction to oversee the construction of said improvements. \nThe City, acting through the Department of Public Service, has agreed to allocate up to $2,400,000.00 to reimburse for eligible construction costs incurred relative to the completion of the additional public infrastructure improvements. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for the proposed expenditure is available as follows: $400,000.00 in the General Permanent Improvement Fund, Fund 7748, and $2,000,000.00 in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, fund 7704.  The funds in 7748 will need to be transferred between projects within the same fund and appropriated.  The funds in 7704 will need to be transferred between projects within the same fund but are already appropriated.   \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite reimbursement agreement as soon as reasonably practicable so as to maintain the current project schedule. \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer cash and appropriation of between projects within the General Permanent Improvement Fund and the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to appropriate the sum of $400,000.00 within the General Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute a Construction Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement Agreement with the KIPP Columbus Foundation, or a designated agent thereof, to facilitate the construction of public infrastructure improvements associated with the expansion of the KIPP Columbus Campus; to authorize the expenditure of up to $400,000.00 from the General Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,000,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
