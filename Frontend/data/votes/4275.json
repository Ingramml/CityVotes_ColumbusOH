    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) and a Grant Agreement with National Church Residences (NCR), a 501(c)(3), for the Clover Glen project.\n \nThe HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and current and future availability of funds.  The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing $2,900,000.00 of bond funds over two years, $1,000,000.00 from the 2021 Capital Budget and $1,900,000.00 from the 2022 Capital Budget.  This legislation would authorize the Director of Development to first execute the HDA and then a Grant Agreement in the amount $1,000,000.00 funded from the 2021 Capital Budget.  Pending the availability of funding in the 2022 Capital Budget, the department will seek City Council’s approval for a planned agreement modification.\n \nNational Church Residences proposes Clover Glen, formally West Broad Senior Housing, a 92-unit, affordable housing community for seniors aged 55+ located at 5719 W Broad Street in Columbus, Franklin County.  Clover Glen serves the unique and growing aging, low income population in Ohio. This senior housing community will offer 92 one-bedroom units with approximately 20 units affordable to residents at or below 30% AMI and 72 units affordable to residents at 60% AMI.\n \nResidents at Clover Glen will benefit from an amenity-rich location with easy access to health care services, grocery stores, and senior services. Of particular note, the property is within walking distance of the Prairie Township Community Center which offers a pool, fitness center, walking path, and seasonal farmer's market, in addition to hosting programming specifically for seniors including adult education opportunities. Residents will also have walking access to dental care, eye care, grocery shopping, park with walking trail, place of worship, pharmacy, dining, salon, bank, and bus service.\n \nThe National Church Residences Home for Life service model was developed as an enhanced delivery approach that will ensure a comprehensive network of services is offered to seniors at the property allowing them to remain happy, healthy, and independent for as long as possible. This robust program is backed by central office support staff and presents a holistic, person centered, supportive services experience that extends far beyond traditional service coordination. Residents will also benefit from National Church Residences existing preferred partnerships and have access to CareGuide, the organization’s online, evidenced-based population health management tool to assess resident needs. CareGuide allows for the tracking of tenant metrics to better recognize patterns that can aide in designing targeted programming while also being proactive in assisting to help prevent avoidable and costly resident hospitalizations. These resources will assist the property staff in developing the enriched service program best suited for resident needs.\n \nClover Glen will consist of one building with 92 one-bedroom apartments units. Each unit will have a separate kitchen, bathroom, living area, and bedroom. At least five of the units will meet Section 504 accessibility standards. In addition, National Church Residences will incorporate building design features to enable residents to age in place including but not limited to accessible means of egress/ingress for each unit, 36” door widths, lever handles and facets, clear floor space of 30” x 50”, and accessible locations of lighting and environmental controls. The building will also incorporate sustainable design practices and methods in accordance with OHFA’s Green Policy.\n \nClover Glen has secured necessary financing and anticipates construction start in Summer of 2022 with construction completion in Fall of 2023.  Funding will be provided to NCR, who will then pass through the funding to West Broad Street Senior Housing LP.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in 2021 Capital Improvement Budget. An amendment to the 2021 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 040110 and expires 11/10/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund and the Development Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement and a Grant Agreement in an amount up to $1,000,000.00 with National Church Residences for the Clover Glen project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund and $500,000.00 from the Development Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
