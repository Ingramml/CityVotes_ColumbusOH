    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into Beneficiary Agreements with Young Women’s Christian Association (YMCA), in an amount up to $150,000.00, and Community Refugee & Immigration Services (CRIS), in an amount up to $150,000.00, using federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to support and increase the organizational capacity of non-profit organizations that experienced revenue losses such as cancelled fundraising events, decreases in donor support, and increased expenditures such as PPE, virtual meeting licenses, and related hardware caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nOrdinance 1201-2021 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate approximately $187,030,138.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds as signed into law by the President of the United States on March 11, 2021.\n \nThe Notice of Financial Award (NOFA) was advertised from April 22, 2022, through May 13, 2022, on the City’s Website (Dept. of Development webpage), the Human Service Chamber of Franklin County’s website, and by press release.  The City received 86 proposals for $9,875,000.00 in requests.  Forty-eight community agencies were recommended for the $5,000,000.00 in available funding.  Forty-five community agencies are listed in Ordinance 2070-2022, one community is listed in Ordinance 2084-2022, and two community agencies are included in this ordinance.  Pending future funding availability and City Council approval, these Beneficiary Agreements may be renewed for two additional years.\n \nThe City of Columbus continues to see increases in the number of residents who lack access to affordable housing. Advocates report that anywhere between 300-600 people are living unsheltered in Columbus every day; the majority desire safe and affordable housing.  Additionally, infant mortality rates in Columbus and Franklin County remain alarmingly high for black babies. Immigrants and refugees relocate to Columbus because we are a welcoming city.   Columbus’ limited supply of housing, lack of knowledge about services and programs that support renting and homeownership, and lack of access to those services cause housing instability among immigrant and refugee residents. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated all these conditions for Columbus residents.  Every agency that was recommended for funding provides services in at least one of the following Elevate! NOFA focus areas:  Increasing Infant Vitality, Reducing Unsheltered Homelessness, or Increasing Housing Stability Among Immigrant and Refugee households. \n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will be modified while these Beneficiary Agreements are in effect and it is requested that the Director of Development be given the authority to modify the terms and conditions of the Beneficiary Agreements without seeking additional Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 11, 2021. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: YWCA’s vendor number is 006086 and contract compliance expires 3/3/2024 and CRIS’s vendor number is 005773 and their contract compliance is pending.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into Beneficiary Agreements with Young Women’s Christian Association (YMCA), in an amount up to $150,000.00, and Community Refugee & Immigration Services (CRIS), in an amount up to $150,000.00, using federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to support and increase the organizational capacity of non-profit organizations that experienced revenue losses such as cancelled fundraising events, decreases in donor support, and increased expenditures such as PPE, virtual meeting licenses, and related hardware caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; to authorize the Director of Development to modify the terms and conditions of the Beneficiary Agreements as needed without seeking further City Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance; to authorize the expenditure of up to $300,000.00 of ARPA funds; and to declare an emergency.
