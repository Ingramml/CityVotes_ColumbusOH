    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Office of CelebrateOne has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Medicaid which is administered by the State’s Managed Care Plans. This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $4,520,000.00 in grant monies to fund the Enhanced Maternal Health Program for the period July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2024. \n \nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid has awarded this grant to the Office of CelebrateOne at the City of Columbus to coordinate the Enhanced Maternal Health Program in Franklin County. CelebrateOne has been designated as the primary grantee organization and administrator for this grant for Franklin County.  The Office of CelebrateOne will establish contracts with twelve (12) community partners in order to provide health and education services to expecting moms and moms of children under one (1) year of age.\n \nGrant funding will provide continued investment in Centering Pregnancy options in priority geographies through Heart of Ohio Family Health Centers and PrimaryOne Health, while also strengthening prenatal home visiting teams at OhioHealth, Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Columbus Public Health. \n \nIn addition, this grant provides support for culturally informed doula care, maintains trauma-informed prenatal support through Moms2B, and provides support to the information and referral line, StepOne for a Healthy Pregnancy. What's more, the grant addresses gaps in service by increasing support for teen outreach through The Center for Healthy Families. \n \nFinally, this grant ensures that the community’s strong core of community health workers at CelebrateOne, Men for the Movement, and the YMCA of Central Ohio continue to connect women and families to services and resources that support a healthy pregnancy.\n \nThe sub-grant recipients are eligible to request and receive 12.5% of their award after their contract is executed, with the remaining grant funding available with monthly invoicing and verification of work performed over the subsequent 23 months.  \n \nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid grant, in the amount of $4,250,000.00, is expected to be received in July 2022 and is planned to conclude by June 30, 2024.  Expenditures are planned within CelebrateOne and twelve partnering agencies.  \n \n\n\n\nCelebrateOne - Connector Corps\n\n$969,275.44\n\n\n\nCelebrateOne - Project Management\n\n$83,702.00\n\n\n\nCelebrateOne- Doula Program\n\n$200,000.00\n\n\n\nYMCA of Central Ohio\n\n$241,921.21\n\n\n\nMen for the Movement \n\n$79,000.00\n\n\n\nCity of Refuge Good Life Foundation\n\n$252,674.28\n\n\n\nMoms2B/The Ohio State University\n\n$702,636.00\n\n\n\nPhysicians CareConnection\n\n$412,704.00\n\n\n\nProject Milk Movement\n\n$180,844.00\n\n\n\nMental Health America of Ohio\n\n$160,383.32\n\n\n\nUrban Family Development Center\n\n$187,182.00\n\n\n\nPrimaryOne Health\n\n$383,131.31\n\n\n\nThe Center for Healthy Families\n\n$200,000.00\n\n\n\nOhioHealth\n\n$220,275.44\n\n\n\nHeart of Ohio Family Health Centers\n\n$246,271.00\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n$4,520,000.00\n\n\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is NOT requested at this time.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $4,520,000.00 in Ohio Department of Medicaid grant monies to fund the Enhanced Maternal Health Program.
