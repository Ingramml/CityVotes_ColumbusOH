    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to modify a contract with the IMPACT Community Action Agency (IMPACT) for the fifth time in order to extend the contract term and allow reimbursement for expenses incurred since December 31, 2020.  No additional funds are being added.\n \nOn May 18, 2020, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 1210-2020 for IMPACT Community Action Agency to provide $2,650,000.00 of CARES Act funding as matching funds for the Hope Program.  On June 29, 2020, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 1408-2020 to expand the range of eligible expenses for the program.  On July 30, 2020, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 1810-2020 to add $7,350,000.00 and to further modify the scope of services.  On October 26, 2020, Columbus City council passed Ordinance 2433-2020 to modify the contract again to reflect the needs of the program.  On November 23, 2020, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 2702-2020 to add additional funds.  \n \nThis ordinance seeks to extend the contract term from December 30, 2020, to March 31, 2021, because the federal government extended the time in which CARES Act funds can be expended and to reimburse IMPACT for expenses incurred since December 31, 2020, as the prior contract expired on December 30, 2020.\n \nThe department contracted with IMPACT to provide rent and mortgage assistance to families affected by COVID-19.  \n \nOriginal Contract                     $ 2,650,000.00                                          Ord. 1210-2020                                          PO230601\nModification 1                                          $               0.00                                          Ord. 1408-2020\nModification 2                                          $ 7,350,000.00                                          Ord. 1810-2020                                          PO241895\nModification 3                                          $               0.00                                          Ord. 2433-2020\nModification 4                                          $    500,000.00                                            Ord. 2702-2020                                          PO241895\nModification 5                                          $                         0.00\nTotal contract amount                     $10,500,000.00\n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested to modify the contract in order to provide for uninterrupted services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  None\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s vendor number is 001447 and is valid from 12/16/2019-12/16/2021\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify a contract with the IMPACT Community Action Agency for the Hope Program to extend the contract term and allow reimbursement for expenses incurred since December 31, 2020; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved Ordinance 1210-2020 to provide $2,650,000.00 in CARES Act funding to IMPACT Community Action Agency as matching funds for the Hope Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved Ordinance 1408-2020 to expand the range of eligible expenses for the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved Ordinance 1810-2020 to add additional funds and modify the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City council passed Ordinance 2433-2020 to modify the contract again to reflect the needs of the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City council passed Ordinance 2702-2020 to add additional funds and modify the contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance allows for the extension of the contract term to March 31, 2021, and allows reimbursement for expenses incurred since December 31, 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in much needed assistance program when low income households have seen significant decreases in personal income due to COVID-19 and the public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, expenditure of CARES Act funding to provide low income households with financial assistance is necessary to address reduced income needed to pay rent or a mortgage caused by the COVID-19 public health emergency; and\n \nWHEREAS, such expenditure of funds has not been previously accounted for in the 2020 or 2021 Budget; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development that it is immediately necessary to enter into a contract modification with IMPACT Community Action Agency to modify the contract in order to provide for uninterrupted services, thereby preserving the public health, peace, safety, and welfare; now therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify a contract with the IMPACT Community Action Agency (IMPACT) to allow for the extension of the contract term to March 31, 2021, and allows reimbursement for expenses incurred since December 31, 2020.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
