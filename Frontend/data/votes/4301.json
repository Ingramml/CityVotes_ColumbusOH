    "description": "Explanation\n \n“Joy” a police horse that has been in service with the Division of Police’s Mounted Unit since 2015 needs to be retired and sold.\n \n“Joy” is having intestinal issues that cause her to kick when she is touched on the left side.  Due to her health issues, years of service, and her uncontrolled kicking at times the Division is requesting that the horse be retired and sold. It would be in the best interest of the Division to take “Joy” out of service and retire her.  \n \nIt is recommended that “Joy” be sold to Officer Shannon David #1756.  Officer David has the resources to properly care for “Joy.”  \n \nAdditionally, the Division of Police Legal Bureau has developed a general release document that relinquishes the City of Columbus from any liability as it relates to the post retirement care and control of “Joy”, and assigns that liability to Officer Shannon David #1756.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThere is a no replacement horse.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to sell to Officer Shannon David #1756, for the sum of $1.00, a police horse with the registered name of “Joy” which has no further value to the Division of Police and to waive the provisions of City Code-Sale of City-owned personal property.($1.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, “Joy” is a 12 year old Friesian Mare and her service life has come to an end; and\n \nWHEREAS, “Joy” has intestinal issues and when touched on the left side will kick from the pain and the Division does not have the ability to care for this condition; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to allow this horse to be purchased by Officer Shannon David #1756 for the sum of $1.00; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
