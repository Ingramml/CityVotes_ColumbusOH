    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe City of Columbus has adopted bold climate and equity goals to ensure that we do our part to combat global climate change and ensure a healthy and prosperous community for all our residents now and in the future. Columbus’ Climate Action Plan outlines a set of commitments to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change while focusing on community needs and proven best practices. Adoption of an Electric Vehicle Ready Parking Ordinance is a priority action in the City’s Climate Action Plan. \n \nThe purpose of this Ordinance is to provide widespread access to electric vehicle charging throughout the City to prepare for rapid electric vehicle adoption, improve local air quality, and achieve the City’s climate and equity goals in an accessible and inclusive manner. Electric vehicles require charging stations to provide power to the vehicle. The vast majority of parking facilities are not currently constructed to accommodate the installation of electric vehicle charging stations. \n \nThe City will collect and review usage data from installed EV chargers on an annual basis. Every 3 years, starting in 2027 2026, the City will reconvene stakeholders to discuss and evaluate usage rates of the installed EV charging stations, new developments in charging technology, and local electric vehicle adoption rates.  Based on that evaluation, market trends, and feedback from stakeholders, the City may propose revisions to the requirements provided in this legislation to ensure that Columbus’ projected electric vehicle charging needs are met, while providing equitable access to EV charging infrastructure throughout the City in the future. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: TBD\n \nTitle\n \nTo supplement the Columbus Zoning Code, Title 33, Chapter 3312 “OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING”, to add new sections 3312.55 through 3312.58 which include requirements to install electric vehicle charging infrastructure in certain newly constructed parking spaces in accordance with the requirements provided therein.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in response to the City of Columbus’ ambitious goal to be a carbon neutral community by 2050, supporting cleaner vehicles will result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions, cleaner air, and improved public health; and \n \nWHEREAS, 38% of Columbus’ greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation; and\n \nWHEREAS, in contrast, electric vehicles in Ohio currently emit 48% fewer greenhouse gasses than gasoline vehicles, with an expectation that this number will improve as more solar and wind power replace fossil fuel energy on the electric grid; and\n \nWHEREAS, gas-powered vehicles are a major contributor to air pollution in Columbus and disproportionately impacts Black, Indigenous, People of Color, and low-income communities, while electric vehicles emit no harmful tailpipe air pollutants; and \n \nWHEREAS, the benefits of electric vehicles include improved air quality, reduction of carbon emissions, quieter and more livable streets, decreased dependence on fossil fuels, and equitable access to lower cost transportation options; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus is committed to working with community organizations and residents to better understand transportation barriers and creating supportive programs that help residents access more environmentally friendly and affordable transportation options; and \n \nWHEREAS, the adoption of electric vehicles in Columbus is outpacing the national average, and auto manufacturers and the Federal Government have committed to investing more than $100 billion to develop electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and\n \nWHEREAS, convenient and reliable access to electric vehicle charging at home and at work is one of the most critical factors in an individual’s decision to purchase an electric vehicle; and \n \nWHEREAS, parking garages and parking lots last for multiple decades. Investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure during building construction often results in up to 75% cost savings compared with retrofitting later; and \n \nWHEREAS, an electric vehicle-ready parking ordinance is critical to making clean vehicles more accessible to all, particularly providing greater access to more affordable at-home charging; and \n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance will ensure that electric vehicle charging stations will be installed as set forth herein; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Development Commission reviewed and commented on this amendment at its monthly public meeting held on May 12, 2022; now, therefore, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \n(See ORD1617-2022 Attachment for Sections 1-4)\n \nSECTION 5. To ensure safety and high quality delivery, the City of Columbus and its authorized contractors and subcontractors shall consider the training and experience level of the workforce that is installing and maintaining EV charging infrastructure. This includes ensuring the workforce is trained in high quality training programs like the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP). In furtherance of this guidance, for any EVSE Installed charging constructed, owned, or operated by or for the City of Columbus, the City and its authorized constructors or subcontractors, from and after January 1, 2023, shall utilize workforce trained by the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program or similar high quality program as determined by rules promulgated pursuant to Columbus City Code Section 3312.56. \n \nSECTION 6. Every 3 years, starting January 2026, the City shall reconvene stakeholders to discuss and evaluate usage rates of the installed EV charging stations, new developments in charging technology, local electric vehicle adoption rates, and the effectiveness of the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program. Based on that evaluation, market trends, and feedback from stakeholders, the City may propose revisions to the requirements provided in this legislation to ensure that Columbus’ projected electric vehicle charging needs are met, while providing, safe and equitable access to EV charging infrastructure throughout the City in the future.\n \nSECTION 7. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period provided by law.",
