    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe City of Columbus Department of Public Safety received a $1.2 million Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Site-based Program (COSSAP) grant award from the United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. Grant award period: October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2023.\n \nCOSSAP funding supports continued outreach services provided through the City’s Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT). RREACT is an innovative outreach service operated by the Division of Fire to actively address the opioid crisis negatively impacting far too many Columbus residents.\n \nRREACT outreach includes firefighters/paramedics, Crisis Intervention Team certified peace officers, a substance use case manager, a registered SUD nurse, a family case manager, and trauma specialist. RREACT proactively connects and builds relationships with opioid users to 1) forge treatment and recovery pathways for users, and 2) provide multi-sector social service navigation and trauma counseling for children and other caregivers in the home. This multi-disciplinary outreach team goes directly into communities to connect with individuals who survive overdose (after Narcan© administration) but then refuse EMS transport to the emergency room. At these follow up meetings, team members assess immediate health needs, provide resource referrals, and create opportunities for users and family/household members to link with harm reduction supplies, treatment programs, trauma services, and social benefit supports.\n \nGrant funds support one family case manager, one trauma specialist, a project manager and overtime costs for firefighters/paramedics and peace officers to fill in when sworn RREACT staff are on vacation, sick and/or attending mandatory training. Grant funds also support continued project evaluation and technical support for the program’s cloud-based Client Management System (CMS).\n \nIn order to achieve project deliverables, RREACT requests legislative approval to:\n \n1) Enter into a $630,795 contract with Franklin County Family and Children First Council to continue family case management and trauma services.  Such multi-system family case management and trauma services are only available through Franklin County Family and Children First Council.\n \n2) Waive bidding requirements and enter into a $60,000 service contract with Mighty Crow, Inc. to continue program evaluation ~ Bid Waiver Form is included with ordinance attachments. \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay program services and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $1,200,000 in Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Site-based Program (COSSAP) funds from the United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. This initiative does not generate any revenue nor require a City match.\n \nFederal Award: October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2023\n§                     2020-AR-BX-0133- $1,200,000 grant award \n \n§                     No City match required\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety to accept a $1,200,000.00 Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant and Substance Abuse Site-based Program (COSSAP) grant award from United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance; to authorize the appropriation of $1,200,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund 2220; to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a $630,795.00 contract with Franklin County Family and Children First Council for multi-sector family case management and trauma recovery services; to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a $60,000.00 contract with Mighty Crow, Inc. for continued RREACT evaluation; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; and to declare an emergency.
