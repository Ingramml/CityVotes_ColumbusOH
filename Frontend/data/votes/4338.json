    "title": "To amend the Southeast Community Reinvestment Area to make modifications to align with the updates located in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Code. (REPEALED BY ORD. 1840-2023 PASSED 7/14/2023) BA",
    "description": "Explanation\nIn 2018, the City adopted a new residential Community Reinvestment Area policy based on the 2016 study from HR&A that evaluated the effectiveness of real property tax abatements.  Chapter 4565 of the City Code was established by Ordinance 2184-2018 that outlines the eligibility requirements to apply for and receive a tax abatement on property used for residential purposes.  Chapter 4565 of the City Code also requires the City to evaluate the policy and CRA categorization every 3 years.  The Southeast CRA needs to be updated to reflect the recent changes made to Chapter 4565 of the City’s Code.  This ordinance will modify the Southeast Community Reinvestment Area by adjusting its boundaries; modifying the percentage and term of abatements to correspond with certain housing designations; include a provision to address lot combinations; and will modify the start date for certain area designations. These changes also align with the updates approved by Council to Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the Southeast Community Reinvestment Area to make modifications to align with the updates located in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Code.
