    "description": "Title\nTo designate and celebrate July 2022 as National Disability Pride Month in the City of Columbus.\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Disability Pride Month came to fruition after the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act on July 26, 1990, a landmark law prohibiting discrimination against people with disabilities. Later that year, Boston, Massachusetts held the first Disability Pride Day celebration; and\n \nWHEREAS, Disability Pride Month is an intentional time to celebrate people with disabilities, both visible and invisible, and an opportunity to highlight the various ways in which society can be made more accessible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that 25.4% of Ohioans are disabled; and\n \nWHEREAS, Disability Pride Month is not federally recognized, yet various cities, including Los Angeles, New York City, San Antonio, Madison, and Charleston have held celebrations and parades; and\n \nWHEREAS, accessibility is crucial to ensuring that all members of the public have equitable access to our community. Ableism is any form of discrimination towards a disabled person, including in social and legal settings. Despite the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act 32 years ago, many segments of society are only accessible to some; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Advisory Committee on Disability Issues has greatly contributed towards furthering disability advocacy. This committee is made up of 20 volunteers and identified actions, makes recommendations for such actions, and supports programs that assure compliance of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other disability-related legislation; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby designate and celebrate July 2022 as National Disability Pride Month in the City of Columbus and thank the Columbus Advisory Committee on Disability Issues for their incredible advocacy.",
