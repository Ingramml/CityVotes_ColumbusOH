    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Education Foundation for Freedom in support of the Columbus Women & Girls’ Fest mentorship programming.\n \nCentral to the Columbus Women & Girls’ Fest in 2022 is an effort to empower young voices through an eight-week mentorship program culminating in the Women & Girls' Fest event itself. The first cohort is composed of 25 youth between the ages of 8 and 18. These youth are paired with professional mentor artists and educators who provide two-hour coaching sessions each week to cultivate performance practices, self-development, and leadership skills.\n \nThe mission of this work is to elevate women of color in the arts through performing arts, culture, education, and entrepreneurship. Participants will organize a specifically crafted showcase demonstrating their progress for the Women & Girls’ Fest. The mentorship and other development opportunities will also help young women to see themselves as future artists and to see the arts as a viable, self-sustaining profession through entrepreneurship.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to allow sufficient time for the organization to receive funding in advance of the Fest event and before the close of the mentoring program.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Reimagine Safety subfund and in the Jobs Growth subfund.\nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Education Foundation for Freedom in support of the Columbus Women & Girls’ Fest; to authorize an appropriation and transfer within the Reimagine Safety subfund; to authorize a transfer to and appropriation and expenditure within the Jobs Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
