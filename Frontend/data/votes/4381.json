    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance amends previously approved ordinance 0284-2021 by modifying the threshold for acceptance and appropriation of Emergency Rental Assistance funds made available by he United State Treasury.\n \nOrdinance 0284-2021 authorized the acceptance and appropriation of $26,822,803.20 in Emergency Rental Assistance 1 (ERA1) funding from the U.S. Treasury, as a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. The $26,822,803.20 referenced in this legislation represents the original federal allocation provided by the U.S. Treasury to the City of Columbus. The ERA 1 program provides for the opportunity to apply for and receive additional proceeds via reallocations from the U.S. Treasury or other governmental entities (e.g. State of Ohio). This ordinance simply amends Ordinance 0284-2021 to authorize the acceptance and appropriation of federal Emergency Rental Assistance 1 funds beyond the $26,822,803.20 referenced in the original ordaining language. All other provisions of Ordinance 0284-2021 remain unchanged.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required to administer this change.\n \nEmergency action is requested to amend the original ordinance as soon as possible so as to correct the ordaining language.\n \nTitle\nTo amend ordinance 0284-2021 by modifying the threshold for acceptance and appropriation of Emergency Rental Assistance 1 funds made available by the United State Treasury; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0284-2021 authorized the acceptance and appropriation of $26,822,803.20 in Emergency Rental Assistance 1 (ERA1) funding from the U.S. Treasury, as a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, the $26,822,803.20 referenced in this legislation represents the original federal allocation provided by the U.S. Treasury to the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, the ERA 1 program provides for the opportunity to apply for and receive additional proceeds via reallocations from the U.S. Treasury or other governmental entities and as such this ordinance seeks authority to amend Ordinance 0284-2021 to authorize the acceptance and appropriation of federal Emergency Rental Assistance 1 funds beyond the $26,822,803.20 referenced in the original ordaining language; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to amend the ordinance in order to  modify the threshold for acceptance and appropriation of Emergency Rental Assistance funds made available by the United State Treasury; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
