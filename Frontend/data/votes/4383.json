    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: In 2017, the City of Columbus, through the Office of the City Attorney, obtained outside special counsel to represent the City in what would become the Multi-District Opiate Litigation (“the MDL”)  - IN RE:  NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION OPIATE LITIGATION in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, MDL Case No. 1:17-md-02804-DAP.  On August 6, 2021, the City Attorney, pursuant to the authorization provided by Ordinance 1263-2021, elected to participate in the material terms of the National Settlement Agreement dated July 21, 2021 pursuant to the terms of the OneOhio Memorandum of Understanding (“The Memorandum”) dated July 28, 2021.  The purpose of this ordinance is to establish a fund to allow for the receipt of settlement funds. \n \nUnder the settlement, Distributors, Manufacturers and Pharmaceutical companies that enter into the settlement agreement will pay the State of Ohio and its subdivisions over a period of 18 years. Pursuant to the Memorandum, these funds will be distributed according to the following allocation: 15% directly to the State of Ohio; 30% directly to subdivisions; and 55% to the OneOhio Foundation (to be utilized for the benefit of the 18 defined regions across the State of Ohio). Most of the money will be restricted in use and specifically earmarked for abatement of the Opioid Epidemic. Developed in consultation with the nation’s leading public health experts, the list of pre-approved uses includes a wide range of intervention, treatment, education, and recovery services so that the state and its subdivisions can decide what will serve their communities.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management will be responsible for monitoring the distribution and appropriate expenditure of these funds based on the provisions of the Memorandum and guidance provided by the OneOhio Foundation. In conjunction with the City Auditor, the Department of Finance and Management is requesting these funds be appropriated to a special revenue fund established to support the delivery of future services addressing the abatement of the opioid crisis and in support of programmatic investments in the Columbus community. Establishing this special revenue fund will ensure that expenditures are aligned with the stated purpose of these funds, as well as the priorities established by the Mayor and City Council and will help facilitate the proper accounting and reporting of related expenditures. Where expenditures require City Council approval in accordance with the Columbus City Codes, City departments will advance said legislation for consideration by City Council.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency consideration is requested so that the fund may be created prior to the Council recess so that funds made available to the City can be accepted and appropriated as quickly as possible. A process will be instituted to allow the Department of Finance and Management and the City Auditor to transfer appropriations to City agencies.\n \nFiscal Impact: The City has recently learned that it will receive an initial settlement payment of $348,798.31, however the exact amount and timing of future settlement payments is still being determined. Funds will not be appropriated within individual department budgets, however subsequent required transfers to departments will be authorized as needed.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the acceptance and appropriation of $348,798.31, or such final amount(s) as allocated pursuant to the One Ohio settlement associated with IN RE:  NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION OPIATE LITIGATION in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, MDL Case No. 1:17-md-02804-DAP by the State of Ohio,; to establish the Opioid Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in 2017, the City of Columbus, through the Office of the City Attorney, obtained outside special counsel to represent the City in what would become the Multi-District Opiate Litigation (“the MDL”)  - IN RE:  NATIONAL PRESCRIPTION OPIATE LITIGATION in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, MDL Case No. 1:17-md-02804-DAP; and \nWHEREAS, on August 6, 2021, the City Attorney, pursuant to the authorization provided by Ordinance 1263-2021, elected to execute formal documents authorizing the City to participate in the material terms of the National Settlement Agreement dated July 21, 2021 pursuant to the terms of the OneOhio Memorandum of Understanding (“The Memorandum”) dated July 28, 2021; and   \nWHEREAS, The Memorandum establishes a mechanism to disburse settlement proceeds from opioid litigation into Ohio’s communities to help abate the opioid crisis, including allocations to Local Governments and Regions through a statewide Foundation; and\nWHEREAS, under the Memorandum, these funds will be distributed according to the following allocation: 15% directly to the State of Ohio; 30% directly to subdivisions; and 55% to the OneOhio Foundation (to be utilized for the benefit of the 18 regions across the State of Ohio); and\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus will receive an initial settlement payment of $348,798.31, however the exact amount and timing of future settlement payments is still being determined; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to accept and appropriate funds from the settlement at the earliest possible time, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
