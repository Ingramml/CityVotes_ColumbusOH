    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with The Righter Company for the Alum Creek Trail - Johnstown Road Eastside Connector Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $280,000.00.\n \nIn 2014, the Recreation and Parks Department was awarded federal grant funding from MORPC (Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission), to be administered by the Ohio Department of Transportation and identified as project PID 99828. These grant funds were to support the construction of this project, improving safety and access to the Alum Creek Trail for the East Columbus Krumm Park Community. The project includes a trail from the Alum Creek Trail, near Ohio Dominican University, to Johnstown Road and Cassady Avenue. The one mile project also includes walking and biking improvements along Johnstown Road and 10th Avenue, connecting to Krumm Park and William Adams Community Center. The project includes a separated trail, bike lanes, modifications to an existing trail bridge, and safety improvements for the neighborhood to connect to the regional trail. This East Columbus neighborhood is bounded by 5th Avenue to I-670 and Stelzer Road to Alum Creek. Over 4,000 residents and employees will be within a 10 minute walk from this project. The connector opens up access to over 126 miles of regional trail network. A future section of this project will extend the bike lanes along Johnstown Road to downtown Gahanna.\nThis ordinance is requesting $280,000.00 to modify the construction contract with Righter Company to cover change orders during the project construction due to unforeseen field conditions, owner requests, and additional construction materials needed to complete the project.  This additional funding request is eligible to be reimbursed from the MORPC grant funding noted herein. It is not in the City's best interest to award additional work through another procurement process because The Righter Company has already performed the change order work in order to keep the project on schedule. The modification amount was determined based on the cost of the completed and anticipated change orders, which were established by contract prices. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nThe Righter Company, Inc.\n2424 Harrison Road\nColumbus, OH 43204 \nMichael D. Killilea, President, 614-272-9700\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004433, 31-0889208\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 22, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as construction work is currently taking place so that the contractor can complete the work on schedule. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year round benefits to urban lifestyles. Access to trails and to key destinations is one of the top rated priorities noted by East Columbus residents. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Recreation and Parks Department conducted extensive public involvement during plan development with neighborhood public open houses, letters of support from the community, the City of Gahanna, and social media feedback from trail users around the region.\n \nArea(s) Affected: East Columbus (50) - All Columbus and regional trail users will benefit from these improvements.\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides safe connections to the regional trail network for nearby neighborhoods. The project will provide an overall safer trail and access to active mode of transportation for the nearby community. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $ $2,282,579.87 was legislated for the Alum Creek Trail - Johnstown Road East Side Connector construction contract by Ordinance 0918-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $280,000.00. $280,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
