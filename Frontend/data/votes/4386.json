    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Facemyer Company for the construction of the Stockbridge Urban Forest Project. The contract amount is $774,699.58, with a contingency of $77,000.00, for a total of $851,699.58 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department was awarded funds from the Clean Ohio Conservation Fund, through the Ohio Public Works Commission, in the amount of $636,000.00, with a grant match of at least $425,000.00, as authorized by Ordinance 2046-2020. This grant and project was to purchase the Stockbridge Elementary School site, demolish the school building, plant native trees to expand the city’s urban tree canopy, and develop a walking path. \n \nThe Stockbridge Urban Forest Project acquired the former Stockbridge Elementary School property in the City’s Scioto Southland Community in October 2020.  The second phase of this project was to demolish the abandoned school and hard surfaces in 2021 as a first phase of site improvements. This ordinance will authorize the Director to enter into a contract to construct these improvements. It is absolutely necessary that this grant funding be spent in its entirety by December 31, 2022 as to not risk losing the grant funded portion of this project. \n \nThe property is adjacent to the City’s existing Stockbridge Park and will provide an additional 11 acres of parkland for the community. Columbus City Schools offered the property for sale and this was a unique opportunity to provide more park space and natural area in a heavily built out neighborhood with a significant deficit in green space.  The Stockbridge Urban Forest Project will be the city’s first pilot project to restore urban tree canopy on a large scale in one of the City’s most hard hit communities for trees. Over 2,000 trees of mixed sizes will be planted, along with a one mile walking path. The result can be a unique case study of transforming a derelict property into a significant 22 acre park and natural area.\n \nThere was no quorum during the July Recreation and Parks Commission Meeting. Per the present Commissioners this ordinance was requested to be sent thru the legislation approval process in order to avoid a delay with this project. There is August recess for Commission and Council.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 24, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 14, 2022. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nFacemyer Company (WBE): $774,699.58\nDavey Resource Group (MAJ): Non Responsive\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Davey Resource Group’s bid was non responsive and Facemyer Company was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Facemyer Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nFacemyer Landscaping, LLC\nPO Box 304\nSunbury, Ohio 43074\nAda Facemyer, (740) 965-4616                                                \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005926, 31-1757841\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 31, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested due to the need to complete this project by the grant deadline of December 31, 2022.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: Creating the Stockbridge Urban Forest provides a space for urban reforestation, in support of the City’s Urban Forestry Master Plan tree canopy goals. Residents in the neighborhood will benefit from a shaded and biodiverse 11 acre space that doubles the size of the existing Stockbridge Park, creating more space for recreation and respite from increasing summer temperatures.\n \nThe Far South neighborhoods of Columbus face significant environmental stresses, including poor air quality, industrial land use degradation, lower than average life expectancy, and some of the City’s lowest tree density at 18% on average. The Stockbridge Urban Forest Project lies within a subset of this area with only 11% tree cover. The area surrounding Stockbridge Park ranks in the 80th to 90th percentile in the Respiratory Hazards Index (U.S. EPA National Air Toxics Assessment), the 80th to 90th percentile in the Proximity to Hazardous Waste Facilities (U.S. EPA Resource Conservation\nand Recovery Act Information), and the 80th to 90th percentile in the Toxic Concentrations of Wastewater Discharge (U.S. EPA Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Model). Trees and green space provide proven benefits to urban residents, including improved air quality, water filtration, cooling, and physical health benefits, and mental health benefits.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Far South Area Commission is in support of the project and preservation of green space is supported in the Scioto Southland Area Plan. On March 6, 2020, a public open house to inform the Urban Forestry Master Plan received input from communities across Columbus, including the Far South. Comments from the Far South community were consistent with their area plan recommendations and the Department’s ongoing engagement with the community. Residents recognize the need for additional park space and street trees in their community. Residents also desire complete street infrastructure and pedestrian connectivity, including policies that result in increased tree plantings to mitigate the impact of the area’s hard surfaces.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far South (64)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan protecting the environmental health and resilience of the City’s waterways, providing long term protection corridors for outdoor experiences, and improved equitable access to trails and greenways.\n \nFiscal Impact: $851,699.58 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 and Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Facemyer Company for construction of the Stockbridge Urban Forest Project; to authorize the transfer of $851,699.58 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $851,699.58 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund and Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
