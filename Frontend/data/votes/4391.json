    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Distinctive Lawn and Landscape, LLC for the Street Trees - Fall 2022 Project. The contract amount is $228,608.00, with a contingency of $22,860.00, for a total of $251,468.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThis project will be installing trees in numerous Columbus Communities to help replace tree species that have been removed throughout the City due to tree mortality. This project will also plant new trees in areas that previously did not have them in all Forestry Planning Areas. The new tree plantings will represent a diverse species of trees selected specifically for each planting location. It takes into consideration the specific site restrictions that each location has in an effort to replace some of our lost Urban Tree Canopy and reduce storm water run-off in the area while not interfering with nearby utilities or structures. \n \nThere was no quorum during the July Recreation and Parks Commission Meeting.
