    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation & Parks to enter into a grant agreement with Green Columbus, a non-profit corporation, to facilitate the ongoing operations of several programs dedicated to environmental stewardship and the revitalization of the city’s tree canopy.\n \nGreen Columbus will utilize this grant to continue offering the following programs and activities:1) growing and distributing trees in Linden and Hilltop at the organization’s tree nurseries (with existing low tree canopy cover) 2) hosting a city-wide World Cleanup Day event on September 2022, and 3) increasing small and safe volunteer activities in alignment with public health guidelines for Earth Day Columbus 2022 (including planting pollinator gardens, tens of thousands of new tree seedlings, supporting urban farms, clean-ups, and many more much-needed restoration activities).\n \nThe current Columbus Urban Forest Master Plan will call for more trees as well as outreach and expanding educational training in hard to reach neighborhoods. Columbus has the fastest-growing heat island in the nation and is in the top 10 overall. As a result, Green Columbus is increasing efforts to plant trees in Central Ohio. Additional benefits include reduced stormwater runoff and increased biodiversity.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide Green Columbus with the resources necessary to sustain ongoing programming and event planning.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding for this grant is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with Green Columbus to maintain programs dedicated to environmental stewardship and the revitalization of the city’s tree canopy; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
