    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with MY Project USA, a non-profit organization, in support of a youth soccer program in the Wedgewood neighborhood. \n \nMY Project USA aims to protect and empower Columbus youth by providing access to educational, healthy, and fun programs that help to keep them safe and connect them with positive influences. The Wedgewood Village Apartment community is home to approximately 2,000 children who need increased access to programs, protection, and the tools that lead to empowerment.\n \nFamilies in the Wedgewood community have a great appreciation for and desire to play soccer. MY Project USA started a soccer team in Wedgewood in 2017, and due to the positive response, the organization developed a year-round program that engages hundreds of children on a weekly basis. \n \nFunding will support the Hilltop Tigers Soccer Club, which will serve 250 or more youth in 2022-23. The club serves as a reward for academic performance throughout the year. This program has severed the recruitment pipeline of the neighborhood’s gangs by providing a safe, productive activity for at-risk youth. Funds will also support contracting with a youth counselor to provide mental health services to the youth served.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in supporting and expanding the MY Project USA Wedgewood soccer program to provide more opportunities for youth engagement.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with MY Project USA in support of the Wedgewood youth soccer program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
