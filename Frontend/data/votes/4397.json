    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Ohio State University/Office of Sponsored Programs, a local non-profit educational institute, for professional services for the Blueprint Columbus - Linden Green Infrastructure Monitoring Project.  Blueprint Columbus is the approach chosen by Columbus and approved by the Ohio EPA to bring the City into compliance with consent orders regarding sewer overflows. One of the benefits of this plan is that the included green infrastructure (GI) is better for the environment than traditional alternatives. While remaining within the City’s right-of-way, the GI will often be located in neighborhoods and adjacent to residential properties. It is important to understand the various impacts from the installation of GI in a dense, urban, residential environment. The data collected as part of this project will be analyzed to determine 1) to what extent property values increase or decrease as a result of the installation of GI and 2) the value of other ecosystem services that are generated by the GI projects, including habitat, water, quality, health and social benefits, and 3) how the valuation of these services varies with the different attributes of GI. \n \nAs a non-profit organization, the Ohio State University/Office of Sponsored Programs will enhance compliance with the City’s commitments to Ohio EPA by measuring the economic, social, and environmental impact of a large-scale GI project on the community in which it is installed. This information will be combined with similar efforts already under way in the Clintonville Blueprint Project Area to improve the design and planning of future projects.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Work under this project began January 1, 2019, and will continue until no later than December 31, 2024.  $95,000 is needed for year 2022 and is budgeted in the 2022 Stormwater Operating Budget. The year 2023 is anticipated to be construction year where funds will not be needed. In 2023 funds will be requested for use in 2024. \n \nSUPPLIER: Ohio State University/Office of Sponsored Programs Dax Vendor #006163 F.I.D. #: 31-6025986, Expires 05/01/2022 (Non-Profit Organization)\n \nEMERGANCY DECLARATION: This ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to ensure there are enough funds to continue the planned project for 2022.\n  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement for professional services with Ohio State University, Office of Sponsored Projects for the Blueprint Columbus - Linden Green Infrastructure Monitoring Project for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Stormwater and Regulatory Management Section, to authorize the expenditure of $95,000.00 from the Stormwater Operating Fund, and to declare an emergency.\n \n  \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance will authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to contract for professional services for the Blueprint Columbus - Linden Green Infrastructure Monitoring Project, and  \n \nWHEREAS, the City's consent order requires the City to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows, and\n \nWHEREAS, the results of this project will attempt to evaluate the economic and social impacts of green infrastructure, and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement for professional services, for the Blueprint Columbus - Linden Green Infrastructure Monitoring Project, without delay in order to ensure there are enough funds to continue the planned project for 2022, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n     \nSECTION 1.
