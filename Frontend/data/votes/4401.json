Program participants who are placed in a job after the program have an average wage of $19 an hour along with full medical benefits. \n \nIn addition to the 8-week job training program, participants receive on-going case management and supportive service dollars to remove barriers to employment. Participants also have access to an employment specialist that assists them with job searching, placement, and retaining their position.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to provide timely support for the organization to hire a workforce development coordinator for the fall cohorts of job training participants.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Jobs Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Creating Central Ohio Futures in support of their job training programs; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Jobs Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
