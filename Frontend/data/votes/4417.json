    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $100,000.00 of the 2021 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a subaward agreement with Central Community House of Columbus Inc. to administer the CHORES program.\n \nThe department advertised a request for proposal for the CHORES Program on Vendor Services (RFQ021712) from 4/28/2022-5/18/2022.  Two proposals were received and the Evaluation Committee found them both able to perform the work.  The organizations are:  Central Community House and LifeCare Alliance.\n \nThis program requires multiple subrecipients due to the volume of work and it is the department’s desire to enter into a subaward agreement with both organizations.  An ordinance to enter into agreement with LifeCare Alliance will be prepared separately.\n \nThe mission of the Department of Development’s Homeowner Services Center’s home repair program, of which CHORES is a part of, is: “assisting individuals and families to remain in their homes and live independently in a safe and sound environment.” The CHORES Program will provide the finances necessary to enable low and moderate-income senior and disabled homeowners to remain in their homes by providing basic home maintenance and minor repair services at no charge to the homeowner.  \n \nThe department anticipates modifying this agreement for the remainder of the city’s Action Plan with HUD.  Based upon mutual agreement, the department would submit legislation to modify the agreement to add additional funds for program years 2023 and 2024.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the CDBG portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the program to be available to eligible homeowners as soon as possible.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 006068 and expires 3/22/2024.\n \nFiscal Impact: $100,000.00 is available from the 2021 CDBG grant.\n \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $100,000.00 of 2021 Community Development Block grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of Development enter into a subaward agreement with Central Community House of Columbus Inc. to administer the CHORES program in an amount up to $100,000.00; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00).\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is a participating jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is the recipient of Community Development Block Grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus City Council has approved the 2021Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020, as required by HUD; and\n \nWHEREAS, the department advertised a request for proposal for the CHORES Program on Vendor Services (RFQ021712) from 4/28/2022-5/18/2022.  Two proposals were received and the Evaluation Committee found them both able to perform the work; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development wished to enter into a subaward agreement with Central Community House for the CHORES program; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a subaward agreement with Central Community House of Columbus Inc. and to appropriate and expend said funds to allow for the program to be available to eligible homeowners as soon as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That from the unappropriated monies and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the sum of $100,000.00 is appropriated in Fund 2248 (CDBG), from Dept-Div 44-10 (Housing), object class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $100,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 2248 (CDBG), Dept-Div 4410 (Housing), object class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a subaward agreement with Central Community House of Columbus Inc. to administer the CHORES program in an amount up to $100,000.00.\n                     \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n                                          \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.                       At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
