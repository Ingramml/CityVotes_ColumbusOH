    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Morgan Brothers Roofing to provide additional funding to continue to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $100,000.00                     Ord. 1836-2021                                          PO299949\nModification No. 1 amount                     $  80,000.00                     Ord. 1290-2022\nModification No. 2 amount                     $160,000.00\nTotal contract amount                                          $340,000.00\n \nThe Roof Replacement Program is a home repair program operated by the City's Housing Division funded by Community Development Block Grant funds. The program was established to assist low and moderate-income homeowners with roof repairs that constitute a critical condition, and when such condition is not corrected, could cause the homeowner to vacate their home.\n \nThe department advertised RFQ019058 on Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide roof replacement services June 18, 2021, and July 12, 2021. Five bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with two bidders under the authority of ordinance 1836-2021.  \n \nUnder the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2022.  This funding will allow the program to continue providing services for the remainder of 2022.  \n \nAdvertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result a delay in providing these services.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract.\n \nThis legislation represents expenditure for a part of the CDBG portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $160,000.00 is available in the CDBG fund, fund 2248, subfund 224808.  Funding is contingent upon approval of a substantial amendment to the 2021 Action Plan by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 038194 and expires 7/1/2023.\n \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $160,000.00 in the Community Development Block Grant fund; authorize the Director of Development to modify a contract with Morgan Brothers Roofing, in an amount up to $160,000.00, to provide additional funding to continue to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program; and to declare an emergency. ($160,000.00)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to modify a contract with Morgan Brothers Roofing to provide additional funding to continue to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development has advertised RFQ019058 seeking contractors to provide roof replacement services on Vendor Services on June 18, 2021, and bids were due on July 12, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Roof Replacement Program was established to assist low and moderate-income homeowners with roof repairs that constitute a critical condition, and when such condition is not corrected, could cause the homeowner to vacate their home; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation will add additional funds to the existing contract for FY 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that the Director is authorized to modify the contract with Morgan Brothers Roofing to continue to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program and to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That from the unappropriated monies and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the sum of $160,000.00 is appropriated in Fund 2248 (CDBG), from Dept-Div 44-10 (Housing), object class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2.  The Director of Development is authorized to modify a contract with Morgan Brothers Roofing, in an amount up to $160,000.00, to provide additional funding to continue to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $160,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in fund 2248 (CDBG), Dept-Div 44-10 (Housing), in object class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.  \n \nSECTION 7  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
