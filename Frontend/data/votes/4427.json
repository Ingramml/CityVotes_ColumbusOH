    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to modify an existing contract with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, to continue a community based peer-to-peer education program for teens in Franklin County and to fund a Reproductive Health Education Coordinator who will expand teen reproductive health education in Columbus and Franklin County. \n \nNationwide Children's Hospital has been the lead in teen reproductive health education efforts within selected Columbus City Schools in the CelebrateOne high priority neighborhoods of Linden, Franklinton, Hilltop, Northeast, Northland, South Side, Southeast and Near East.  These contracts will support the goal to improve reproductive health planning by implementing evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programming in schools.\n \nIn addition to having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation, Ohio ranks 23rd out of all 50 states for teenage pregnancies. Teen pregnancy is a significant contributor to pre-maturity, a leading cause of infant mortality, because pregnant teens have a higher risk for having a baby born too small or too soon.\n \nA recent examination of the National Survey of Family Growth revealed that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50% less likely to report a pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education. Currently, without any state health education standards, many teens in Ohio and Franklin County do not have access to comprehensive, medically-accurate sex education.\n \nThe Office of CelebrateOne, in partnership with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Nationwide Children’s Hospital, reinforces peer education by engaging youth in Columbus City Schools from the CelebrateOne neighborhoods. Peer education supports the development of healthy lifestyles and responsible choices by adolescents. Peer educators will receive training and incentives to increase their knowledge of essential, evidence-based reproductive health information, establish important leadership skills, and gain the confidence to engage their peers and larger community in vital conversations.\n                                                                                  \nThe original contract, PO189569, was established with Ordinance 1637-2019 which passed City Council on July 1, 2019. The first modification, PO205466, was established with Ordinance 3142-2019 which passed City Council on December 9, 2019.The second modification, PO244930, was established with Ordinance 1745-2020 which passed City Council on July 27, 2020. The third modification was authorized by Ordinance 2080-2021 passed on September 16, 2021. Additional Ordinances 3134-2021 and 3329-2021 extended the program timeline so that invoices could be paid after the original expected end date.\n \nThis ordinance will modify the existing contract by increasing the funding and continuing the program through June 30, 2023 to allow for the Reproductive Health Education Coordinator to provide health education programming through the 2022-2023 school year.  \n \nAdditional Amount Being Requested:   $109,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract (PO189569)              $100,000.00\nModification 1 (PO205966)                  $55,720.00\nModification 2 (PO244930)                  $116,731.50\nModification 3 (PO300526)                  $150,000.00\nModification 4 (this ordinance)             $109,000.00            \nTotal Contract Amount:                       $531,451.50\n \nVendor Information:  Nationwide Children’s Hospital Inc.
