    "description": "Explanation\n BACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Executive Director, Office of CelebrateOne to accept and appropriate funding from the Ohio Department of Health, Disparities in Maternal Health Community Birth Equity Fund in the amount of $20,000.00. \n \nThe project was in three phases: Building a Strong Foundation, Elevating Community Voices and Sharing Out and Moving to Action. The first phase working with a CelebrateOne core team will align on the project goals, roles and establish a timeline. Design Impact will facilitate training and co-creation sessions with CelebrateOne recruiting peer researchers and groups of pregnant and parenting individuals which geographically and demographically represent families most impacted by infant and maternal morbidity from CelebrateOne zip codes. \n \nThe funding was used to establish contracts with Design Impact and Nationwide Children's Hospital to provide such services.  However,  the invoices from Nationwide Children's Hospital PO293647 were paid out from the General Fund in error. This ordinance will allow an expenditure correction to move the expense from the General Fund into Grant G402102 from where it should have been paid. \n  \nEmergency action is requested in order to correct the expenditure from the General Fund into Grant G402102.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation accepts and appropriates an additional $20,000.00 from the Ohio Department of Health, Birth Equity Grant #G402102.
