Diverting food waste from the landfill through an alternative waste stream solution is a key section of the City of Columbus Climate Action Plan. By 2050, the city has an aggressive goal of a 90% reduction in organic waste resulting in nearly 134,000 metric tons of greenhouse emissions. \nThe City estimates the pilot will cost $43,750, of which it is seeking $35,000 from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, and a 25% match from the City of Columbus will cover the remainder of the cost ($10,937.50).\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to accept grant funds from the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, to execute those documents necessary to accept the grant, to administer the grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of that award, and to refund any unused funds to either grantor after the grant period ends if final accounting determines a refund is owed.  Separate legislation will be submitted to Council to expend awarded grant funds and to encumber and expend necessary matching City funds.  \n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTGrant funding will be allocated to support partial funding of the pilot program for food waste drop-off locations located throughout the City of Columbus, at the discretion of the Division of Refuse Collection and Keep Columbus Beautiful. \n3.  FISCAL IMPACTPursuant to the terms and conditions of the grants, the Department of Public Service will be responsible for covering a 25% match required by the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio grants funds.
