    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Strawser Paving Company for the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 1 in an amount up to $1,087,815.49.\nOrdinance 1178-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Strawser Paving Company for the construction of the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 1 and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.  The work performed to date for this project consists of repairing and resurfacing 84 city streets and constructing 433 ADA curb ramps along those streets.  \n \nOrdinance 0444-2021 adopted the Vision Zero Columbus Action Plan 1.0 as the primary framework for reducing traffic deaths and serious injuries to zero within the City of Columbus. The Columbus Vision Zero Action Plan 1.0 is a two-year plan to begin to eliminate fatal and serious injury crashes on city streets. \n \nThe work for modification 1 will consist of implementing Vision Zero safety improvements for Livingston Avenue from College Avenue to James Road, and other such work as may be necessary.  The construction cost of this modification is $1,087,815.49 and the amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $87,025.24. The total legislated amount for this modification is $1,174,840.73.\n \nThe original contract amount, no inspection:                $9,739,943.29                      (PO277333, Ord. 1178-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:            $1,087,815.49                          (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:       $10,827,758.78  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Strawser Paving Company.\n \n2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of additional work needed to implement the Vision Zero safety improvements within the committed schedule of improvements.  This unforeseen work exceeded the project’s contingency amount.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Strawser Paving Company is CC006114 and expires 01/14/2023.\n \n4.  Pre-Qualification Status\nStrawser Paving Company and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,174,840.73 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  A transfer of funds and appropriation is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.  \n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of modification 1 for the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 1 to facilitate the completion of planned improvements in a timely manner, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Strawser Paving Company in connection with the Resurfacing - 2021 Project 1; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,174,840.73 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,174,840.73) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0444-2021 adopted the Vision Zero Columbus Action Plan 1.0 as the primary framework for reducing traffic deaths and serious injuries to zero within the City of Columbus.; and \n \nWHEREAS, contract no.
