Wheatland Avenue, is transforming a City of Columbus Land Bank property in the Hilltop into a farm and neighborhood facility. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased food insecurity for many Columbus residents. The Mid-Ohio Food Collective Wheatland Farm provides education opportunities and healthy foods to low- and moderate- income families.
