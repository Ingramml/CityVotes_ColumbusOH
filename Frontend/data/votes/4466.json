Jackson overturned 49 years of precedent protecting people’s right to make decisions about their own necessary medical care; and\n \nWHEREAS, the immediate implementation of Ohio Senate Bill 23 stripped Ohioans of their full range of essential health care options, of their bodily autonomy and control over their reproductive lives, and of their family autonomy to make decisions about how, whether, or when to be a parent; and\n \nWHEREAS, abortion bans and restrictions fall hardest on Black, brown, low-income, and other marginalized people whose barriers to readily accessible healthcare have always been greatest, especially Black women and mothers who bear the highest rates of pregnancy complications, maternal mortality, and infant mortality; and\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need for culturally-competent and trauma-informed care to assist women in navigating the medical system; and\n \nWHEREAS, residents deserve to be able to make decisions about pregnancy and abortion free from fear or politicians who shame and try to control them; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the need for Access to Reproductive Healthcare so as to necessitate the lending of support to these organizations in order to assure the immediate preservation of the public health and safety; NOW THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
