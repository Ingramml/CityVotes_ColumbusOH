    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with 2K General Company for the construction of the Glenwood and Windsor Pool Replacements Project. The contract amount is $16,428,000.00, with a contingency of $1,600,000.00, for a total of $18,028,000.00 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance. An additional $100,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $18,128,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \n$3,000,000.00 of the funding for this project is being provided by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program and in accordance with the City’s U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 2022 Annual Action Plan as approved by Council. This CDBG funding is contingent on the completion of a successful environmental review and receipt of an Authorization to Utilize Grant Funds issued by HUD which is expected in the near future. \n \nThe Windsor Swimming Pool was originally built in 1968 and Glenwood Swimming Pool was originally built in 1973. After serving the City of Columbus for more than fifty years, both facilities need to be replaced to function in an efficient and safe manner. The bathhouse at Windsor, which was built in 2012, will undergo minor improvements and both pools will be improved to be more inclusive to persons with various abilities, meeting the requirements obtained by the public outreach activities which are part of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan.  \n \nBoth pools, in their current configuration, are limited for programming based on their amenities. It is the intent of the design to increase the capacity for programs and to increase attendance at these pools overall. These construction contracts will remove and replace both pools. The Recreation and Parks Department is working hard not to impact the 2023 swimming seasons at both of these locations. With the time required for demolition, construction permits, long lead time on materials, and an anticipated concrete shortage, it is necessary that construction be started as soon as possible. \n \nThere was no quorum during the July Recreation and Parks Commission Meeting. Per the present Commissioners this ordinance was requested to be sent thru the legislation approval process in order to avoid a delay with this project. There is August recess for Commission and Council.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on May 25, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 24, 2022. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership.
