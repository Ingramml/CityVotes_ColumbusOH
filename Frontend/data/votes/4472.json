    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Smoot Company for construction management and inspection services for the Glenwood and Windsor Pool Replacements Project. The contract amount is $1,247,670.91, with a contingency of $300,000.00, for a total of $1,547,670.91 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance.\n \nThe Windsor Swimming Pool was originally built in 1968 and Glenwood Swimming Pool was originally built in 1973. After serving the City of Columbus for more than fifty years, both facilities need to be replaced to function in an efficient and safe manner. The bathhouse at Windsor, which was built in 2012, will undergo minor improvements and both pools will be improved to be more inclusive to persons with various abilities, meeting the requirements obtained by the public outreach activities which are part of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan.  \n \nBoth pools, in their current configuration, are limited for programming based on their amenities. It is the intent of the design to increase the capacity for programs and to increase attendance at these pools overall. These construction contracts will remove and replace both pools. The Recreation and Parks Department is working hard not to impact the 2023 swimming seasons at both of these locations. With the time required for demolition, construction permits, long lead time on materials, and an anticipated concrete shortage, it is necessary that construction be started as soon as possible. \n \nThere was no quorum during the July Recreation and Parks Commission Meeting. Per the present Commissioners this ordinance was requested to be sent thru the legislation approval process in order to avoid a delay with this project. There is August recess for Commission and Council.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on June 7, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 28, 2022.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nAsner Advisory (MAJ)\nDLZ Ohio (MAJ)\nHill International (MAJ)\nSmoot Company (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended Smoot Company be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nSmoot Construction Company of Ohio\n1907 Leonard Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio 43219                                                     \nLewis Smoot Jr., (614) 253-9000                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004871, 31-1224826\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 6, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the contractor can complete all necessary work in order to minimize the impact on the 2023 swim season. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will benefit the public by improving two important recreational facilities that have served their respective communities for over 50 years. Improvements to our parks and facilities provide significant benefits to the quality of life in the neighborhoods in which they are located.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: As part of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatic Capital Improvement Plan, residents in the service areas of these swimming pools will be engaged through their Associations and Commissions.  In addition, a project website has been established with a survey which is intended to gather pertinent information that will lead to a successful design and construction opportunity in the South Linden and Greater Hilltop Neighborhoods (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ACIPSurvey <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.surveymonkey.com/r/ACIPSurvey__;!!J-4R7rTSYA!LVRd8p1yRU6L9Mn9X-WXvqTgN1XFL0cyAbbqDyICwPeUQf6dR15ugel6uB-jiShpaVAjbw$>).  Additional meetings will take place on or around the start of construction.\n \nArea(s) Affected: East Columbus (50), Greater Hilltop (53)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by improving existing aquatics facilities and helping to ensure that facilities remain safe and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,547,670.91 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Smoot Company for construction management and inspection services for the Glenwood and Windsor Pool Replacements Project; to authorize the transfer of $1,547,670.91 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $1,547,670.91 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
