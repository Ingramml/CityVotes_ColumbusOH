    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with General Temperature Control to replace the chiller and related components at Dodge Community Center. The contract amount is $229,800.00, with a contingency of $22,980.00, for a total of $252,780.00 being authorized for this contract by this ordinance.\n \nThe chiller that provides air conditioning for Dodge Community Recreation Center is failing. Columbus Recreation and Parks Departmental HVAC staff have had several calls for service on this unit in recent history and it is at the end of its useful life. The unit is currently operating at approximately 50% of its capacity and is in danger of failing to operate completely in the near future. This cooling system will not keep up with demand during high temperatures and will further decline as it struggles to keep up with cooling the building.\n \nDodge Community Center is located in Franklinton and serves this and other communities on the west side. This center is a cooling center in extreme heat and is frequently utilized for an emergency shelter by The Red Cross for victims of fire, flooding, and other urgent needs. In addition to the daily programming and operations that take place at Dodge, these additional emergency uses make this center a vital part of the City of Columbus overall emergency response.   \n \nDepartmental HVAC staff have reached out to vendors to check on availability and lead times for a new chiller and were told that 40 to 60 weeks is common right now to receive a newly ordered chiller of this size. General Temperature Control is able to secure the right sized 130 ton chiller that was already in production for delivery at the end of this month from Carrier, with a lead time of only three to four weeks. It should be available for delivery in late July 2022. The Recreation and Parks Department has had a positive working history with General Temperature Control and has had success with Carrier made products. Having access to this unit on such a short timeline is very uncommon, particularly during the current environment involving extreme supply chain delays. Moving this emergency replacement forward is vital for the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s community response and service. \n \nDue to the emergency use that take place at this facility on a regular basis, it is imperative that the work to replace this chiller be done as soon as possible. As a result, the Recreation and Parks Department is requesting to waive bidding and enter into contract with General Temperature Control so the chiller can be replaced immediately. \n \nThere was no quorum during the July Recreation and Parks Commission Meeting. Per the present Commissioners this ordinance was requested to be sent thru the legislation approval process in order to avoid a delay with this project. There is August recess for Commission and Council.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGeneral Temperature Control Inc.\n970 West Walnut Street\nCanal Winchester, Ohio 43110 \nBob Billings, 614-417-0107\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004830, 31-1201236\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 30, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the existing cooling system has already begun to fail and complete failure of the existing unit will remove this community center from use as a cooling center and emergency shelter.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract will help ensure that the center can continue operating as a cooling center for the near west side of Columbus and beyond during times of need. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for well-kept and user friendly facilities through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff. During periods of extreme heat, the community uses this facility as a place to cool off. It is also used as a temporary emergency shelter for the community at times. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to improve operations and services to the citizens of Columbus.\n \nFiscal Impact: $252,780.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with General Temperature Control to replace the chiller and related components at Dodge Community Center; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329; to authorize the transfer of $252,780.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2021 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $252,780.00 from the Recreation and Parks Fund and Voted Bond Fund, and to declare an emergency.
