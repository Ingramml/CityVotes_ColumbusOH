    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the construction contract for Utility Cut and Restoration Services with Decker Construction Company to add $1,200,000.00 in funding for the Division of Water and to extend the term of the contract through August 5, 2023. Various types of utility excavations are performed within the City of Columbus' right-of-way and City owned properties by the Department of Public Utilities.  The restoration work typically involves repair of existing pavement, curbs, and sidewalks in a manner conforming to the City of Columbus, Construction and Material Specifications (CMSC).  The Department routinely outsources this restoration work to a contractor that is equipped and trained to make these repairs.  Typical types of restoration work that require outsourcing involve the installation of wheelchair ramps, asphalt repair involving thermal bond heat weld repairs, asphalt milling machines capable of full width milling, and the delivery of flowable controlled density fill using volumetric mixer trucks.  Recent changes to restoration requirements have led to the need to establish additional funding for this contract.\n \nCONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The Director of Public Utilities publicly opened one bid on May 8, 2019 from the Decker Construction Company.  The bid from Decker Construction Company was deemed the lowest, most responsive and responsible bid.
