    "description": "Explanation\nIn 2018, the City adopted a new residential Community Reinvestment Area policy based on the 2016 study from HR&A that evaluated the effectiveness of real property tax abatements.  Chapter 4565 of the City Code was established by Ordinance 2184-2018 that outlines the eligibility requirements to apply for, and receive, a tax abatement on property used for residential purposes.  This ordinance will modify the AC Humko Community Reinvestment Area by adjusting its boundaries; modifying the percentage and term of abatements to correspond with certain housing designations; include a provision to address lot combinations; and modifying the start date for certain area designations. These changes also align with the updates approved by Council to Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the AC Humko Community Reinvestment Area to align with the recent changes contained in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes; and to amend the geographic boundaries of AC Humko Community Reinvestment Area.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the council of the City of Columbus (hereinafter \"Council\") desires to pursue reasonable and legitimate incentive measures to assist and encourage development in specific areas of the City of Columbus that have not enjoyed reinvestment from remodeling or new construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, Resolution No. 1698-78, approved August 3, 1978, authorized the Department of Development to carry out a Community Reinvestment Program, pursuant to Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code, and approved certain administrative procedures for the program; and  \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1841-2005 created the AC Humko Community Reinvestment Area and authorized real property tax exemptions within it, as provided per Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has established a goal of fostering private sector investment to build mixed income neighborhoods dispersed throughout the City; and\nWHEREAS, in 2018 City developed an incentive policy to encourage development of affordable housing through targeted economic development incentives, including real property tax abatements, throughout the City; and\nWHEREAS, the policy adopted in 2018 outlined the requirement to review the categorization of existing CRAs and the policy requirements every three (3) years; and\nWHEREAS, 2021 represents the first tri-annual review and policy updates; and\nWHEREAS, based on the review, the Director is requesting to amend the AC Humko CRA as provided herein, NOW, THEREFORE, \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
