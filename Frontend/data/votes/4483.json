    "title": "To amend the Northland Community Reinvestment Area to make modifications to align with the updates located in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes; and to set forth the circumstances under which a combined parcel resulting from the combination of a parcel within the original CRA boundaries and parcel(s) outside of the original CRA boundaries will be deemed to be within the CRA.",
    "description": "Explanation\nIn 2018, the City adopted a new residential Community Reinvestment Area policy based on the 2016 study from HR&A that evaluated the effectiveness of real property tax abatements.  Chapter 4565 of the City Code was established by Ordinance 2184-2018 that outlines the eligibility requirements to apply for and receive a tax abatement on property used for residential purposes.  Chapter 4565 of the City Code also requires the City to evaluate the policy and CRA categorization every 3 years.  The Northland CRA needs to be updated to reflect the recent changes made to Chapter 4565 of the City’s Code.  This ordinance will modify the Northland Community Reinvestment Area by adjusting its boundaries; modifying the percentage and term of abatements to correspond with certain housing designations; include a provision to address lot combinations; and will modify the start date for certain area designations. These changes also align with the updates approved by Council to Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the Northland Community Reinvestment Area to make modifications to align with the updates located in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Codes; and to set forth the circumstances under which a combined parcel resulting from the combination of a parcel within the original CRA boundaries and parcel(s) outside of the original CRA boundaries will be deemed to be within the CRA.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the council of the City of Columbus (hereinafter \"Council\") desires to pursue reasonable and legitimate incentive measures to assist and encourage development in specific areas of the City of Columbus that have not enjoyed reinvestment from remodeling or new construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, Resolution No. 1698-78, approved August 3, 1978, authorized the Department of Development to carry out a Community Reinvestment Program, pursuant to Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code, and approved certain administrative procedures for the program; and  \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1107-2020 created the Northland Community Reinvestment Area and authorized real property tax exemptions within it, as provided per Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has established a goal of fostering private sector investment to build mixed income neighborhoods dispersed throughout the City; and\nWHEREAS, in 2018 the City developed an incentive policy to encourage development of affordable housing through targeted economic development incentives, including real property tax abatements, throughout the City; and\nWHEREAS, the Northland CRA, created in 2020, must be updated to reflect the 2022 changes made by Council to Chapter 4565 of the City’s Code per Ordinance 1843-2022; NOW, THEREFORE, \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
