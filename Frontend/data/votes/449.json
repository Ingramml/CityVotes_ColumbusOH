    "description": "Title\nTo Denounce Anti-Asian Hate, Discrimination, and Violence in Columbus, Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council is reaffirming our commitment to our Asian and Asian-American residents in Columbus, Ohio and denouncing anti-Asian hate, discrimination, and violence in all forms. On Tuesday, March 16, 2021 eight victims, six of which were Asian women, were murdered in a heinous crime in Georgia; and\n \nWHEREAS, harassment and violence against Asian persons, families and communities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic due to inflammatory and racist rhetoric; and\n \nWHEREAS, according to “Stop AAPI Hate,” in the past year there were nearly 3,800 instances of discrimination against Asians that were reported at an increase of more than 150%, with 68% of these incidents affecting Asian women. The number of unreported instances of discrimination against Asians in the US is unknown; and\n \nWHEREAS, anti-Asian sentiments are not new in our country, and we acknowledge history and trauma related to the intersections of racism, sexism, and xenophobia; and\n \nWHEREAS, the rising anti-Asian sentiment, especially against East Asian and Southeast Asian ethnicities related to COVID-19, has no place in our country, and no place in our city. Asian and Asian-American residents are our neighbors, front-line workers, and friends; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is a welcoming city, home to thousands of residents and students from Asian countries, and we thrive on the diversity of these residents. In particular, our Asian-American residents are crucial to our success; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council denounces all forms of hate against Asian Americans, in Columbus and throughout our country; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this Council does hereby denounce anti-Asian hate, discrimination, and violence in the City of Columbus.",
