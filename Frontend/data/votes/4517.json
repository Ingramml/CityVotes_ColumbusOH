From the very beginning, the City of Columbus and The Ohio State University were funding partners; and\n \nWHEREAS, NDC is committed to neighborhood revitalization through access to affordable, professional design services. Historically clients of community design centers are individuals and community groups working to revitalize economically distressed areas; and\n \nWHEREAS, the mission of NDC is to promote economic prosperity and an enriched quality of life through the rediscovery and revitalization of the built environment in underserved communities. Their team of design professionals and students utilize design thinking, public engagement, project visioning, and advocacy in the pursuit of these aspirations; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus receives Neighborhood Commercial Revitalization (NCR) funds which started in 1982 with the Short North and now includes other neighborhoods such as Franklinton, Hilltop, Southside, Near East Side, and Linden. Currently, the NDC offers free design services to eligible properties in seven commercial corridors in support of small businesses and community organizations; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Department of Neighborhoods partnered with the Neighborhood Design Center to produce strategic community plans for both the Linden (One Linden, 2018) and Hilltop (Envision Hilltop, 2020) neighborhoods; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council is thankful for the work and leadership of the Neighborhood Design Center over the past 40 years and looks forward to continuing this partnership for years to come; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate the Neighborhood Design Center on their 40th Anniversary of serving small businesses and communities in Columbus, Ohio.",
