    "description": "Title\nTo honor, recognize and celebrate Welcoming Week 2022 in Columbus, Ohio and thank Elevate Northland for their focus on creating spaces that foster belonging. \n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Welcoming Week 2022, which takes place September 9th through 18th, celebrates the growing movement of communities that fully embrace immigrants and their contributions to the social fabric of our country. This year’s theme focuses on the places and spaces that foster belonging; and\n \nWHEREAS, Welcoming Week is an annual celebration bringing together thousands of people and a series of local events that celebrate the contributions of immigrants, refugees and new Americans, and the role our communities play in fostering a greater welcome; and\n \nWHEREAS, efforts that promote understanding and collaboration between all members of our community are crucial in encouraging and preserving the welcoming and inclusive environment of Columbus, Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, during the past few years of deepened divisions and the COVID-19 pandemic renewing anti-immigrant sentiment, Welcoming Week reminds us to double down on our inclusive vision and find new ways to bring together people across lines of difference to develop greater understanding and mutual support; and\n \nWHEREAS, one organization that embodies this year’s theme of focusing on places and spaces that foster belonging is Elevate Northland, a local non-profit that brings together groups working on business development and building community bonds. Elevate Northland has a vision for a cultural destination within a connected community and uplifts people of diverse background; and\n \nWHEREAS, Elevate Northland hosts their annual Northland Unity Festival to bring people together to share in culture, food, and entertainment. This year the Northland Unity Festival is on Saturday, September 17th from 3-7 pm at the North YMCA; and\n \nWHEREAS, fostering a welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of race, ethnicity, or place of origin, enhances the cultural fabric, economic growth, global competitiveness, and overall prosperity for current and future generations in the City of Columbus; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this Council does hereby honor, recognize and celebrate Welcoming Week from September 9-18, 2022 and encourages members of our community to attend the Northland Unity Festival on Saturday, September 17, 2022.",
