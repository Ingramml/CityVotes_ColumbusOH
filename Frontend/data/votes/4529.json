    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Shelly & Sands, Inc. for the Roadway - Shook Road Phase II project in an amount up to $88,689.04, and to provide payment for additional construction administration and inspection services up to $13,303.36.\nOrdinance No. 2296-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Shelly & Sands, Inc. for the construction of the Roadway - Shook Road Phase II project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.  This contract includes the widening of Shook Road (north of State Route 317) to provide a southbound right turn lane and widen State Route 317 to provide both a westbound and eastbound left turn lane at the Shook Road intersection.  Sidewalk along both sides of Shook Road will be extended from State Route 317 north to the existing sidewalk limits. A new box span signal will be installed at the intersection of State Route 317 and Shook Road.\n \nThe work for Modification No. 1 will consist of additional pavement to accommodate traffic during construction and additional driveway construction, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract.  \n \nThe original contract amount, no inspection:              $1,680,256.95                      (PO298926, Ord. 2296-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:          $     88,689.04                     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:       $1,768,945.99  \n \nThe amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $13,303.36.  The total legislated amount is $101,992.40 for this modification. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Shelly & Sands, Inc.\n \n2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of unforeseen work needed for the construction of a large commercial driveway on the south and eastern extent of the project. The impacts of this include revisions to the drainage system and a large volume of reconstruction to provide a proper tie-in. The existing project budget didn’t account for this extra work item. There was also a change required in the mode of transportation due to the existing pavement widths and the original scheme provided in the plans.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Shelly & Sands, Inc. is CC006043 and expires 2/3/2024.\n \n4.  Pre-Qualification Status\nShelly & Sands, Inc. and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $82,727.00 are available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704.  The remaining funds of $19,265.40 are available and appropriated within the Northland and Other Acquisitions Fund, Fund 7735.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  \n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of Modification No. 1 for the Roadway - Shook Road Phase II project to facilitate the completion of planned improvements in a timely manner, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.                     \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Shelly & Sands, Inc. in connection with the Roadway - Shook Road Phase II project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $101,992.40 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund (7704) and the Northland and Other Acquisitions Fund (7735); and to declare an emergency.  ($101,992.40) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
