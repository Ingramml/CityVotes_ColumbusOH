    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to reimburse the Department of Public Utilities for work performed in conjunction with the Dyer / Lazar HSTS Elimination Project. \nThe aforementioned project encompassed the extension of more than 6,400 feet of sanitary sewer service in the vicinity of Dyer and Lazar roads for the purpose of reducing the reliance on home treatment systems in that area due to the potential hazard of groundwater pollution.
