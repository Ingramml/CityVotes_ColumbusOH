    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a service contract with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office (the “FCEO”) for the provision of snow and ice removal services during the 2022-2023 winter season and to expend up to $700,000.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, Fund 2265, to compensate the FCEO for the performance of said services.  \n \nIn order to maximize operating efficiencies, County and City forces occasionally service portions of roadways lying within the corporate limits of the jurisdiction of the other.  Each entity is responsible for tracking the labor, equipment, and materials used in order to determine the cost for all snow plow and ice removal activities performed. Historically, the FCEO services more City of Columbus roadways in comparison to the number of County roadways serviced by the City, with the entities settling up once each year. \n \nThis ordinance is to authorize: 1) the execution of a service contract between Public Service and the FCEO and 2) the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $700,000.00, which represents the estimated net amount that will be due to the FCEO for the 2022-2023 winter season.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $700,000.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, Fund 2265. This is a planned and budgeted annual expenditure, and the requisite funds are appropriated.   \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite service contract as soon as reasonably practicable before winter commences.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to reimburse another government agency and as such is not an expenditure that falls under this program.    \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office for the provision of snow and ice removal services during the 2022-2023 winter season; to authorize the expenditure of up to $700,000.00 from the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund for those services; and to declare an emergency.  ($700,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a service contract with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office (the “FCEO”) for the provision of snow and ice removal services during the 2022-2023 winter season; and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to maximize operating efficiencies, County and City forces occasionally service portions of the other’s roadways during episodes of inclement weather, with each entity tracking the labor, equipment, and materials used in order to determine the cost for all snow plow and ice removal activities performed; and\n \nWHEREAS, historically, the FCEO services more City of Columbus roadways in comparison to the number of County roadways serviced by the City, with the entities settling up once each year; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance also authorizes the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $700,000.00 within the Street Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund, which represents the estimated net amount that will be due to the FCEO for the 2022-2023 winter season; and\n \nWHEREAS, this expenditure is to reimburse another government agency and as such is not an expenditure that falls under the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program; and    \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with the Franklin County Engineer's Office for the provision of snow and ice removal services during the 2022-2023 winter season in order to facilitate the execution of the requisite service contract as soon as reasonably practicable before winter commences, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service is hereby authorized to enter into contract with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office (\"FCEO\") for reimbursement of snow and ice removal services rendered by the FCEO on City streets during the 2022-2023 winter season.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of up to $700,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 2265 (Streets Construction Maintenance and Repair Fund), Dept-Div 5911 (Infrastructure Management), in Object Class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
