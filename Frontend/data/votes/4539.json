    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Carpenter Marty Transportation to add additional funds for design of the Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way project.\nOrdinance 0856-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Carpenter Marty Transportation for the Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way project.  The Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way contract is for preliminary engineering and detailed design for improvements to Little Turtle Way from SR-161 to Firewater Lane.  Improvements are anticipated to include the consolidation, repurposing, and rehabilitation of deteriorated, excess vehicular infrastructure to provide a safer, multimodal corridor serving current and future demands in the amount of $350,000.00\n \nOrdinance 1686-2020 authorized modification number one in the amount of $130,000.00 to complete the construction plans for the project based on the results of the traffic study and preliminary alignment plan.  \n \nOrdinance 1784-2021 authorized modification number two in the amount of $30,000 to complete design changes from the backcheck review comments and coordination with City fire and safety reviewers.\n \nThis ordinance is needed for plan revisions to show the removal of line work pertaining to right of way plans which were removed from the plans.  This also includes plan revisions to modify storm sewers, shared use path alignment, and sidewalks where needed to meet the right of way being held to existing areas only.  This includes all changes to the plan set necessary to meet the guidelines for our plan revisions policies.  \n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $350,000.00                         (PO113872, Ord. 0856-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $130,000.00                          (PO239187, Ord. 1686-2020)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $  30,000.00      (PO283156, Ord. 1784-2021)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                                    $  75,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $585,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Carpenter Marty Transportation.\n \n2.  UNPLANNED MODIFICATION\nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary because of a change in the direction of the project after the plan was approved requiring the removal of all proposed new right of way areas and temporary easements.  This change necessitates the adjustment of various elements of the project and now needs to be revised.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Carpenter Marty Transportation is CC008494 and expires 10/14/2023.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis is a budgeted expense.  Funding in the amount of $75,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, within Project P531002-100000 (Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way).\n \n5.
