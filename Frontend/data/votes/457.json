    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with EDGE Group, Inc. for professional services associated with the final design plans and bidding documents for the Ulry Warner Park Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $454,533.00.\n \nIn 2013, the Recreation and Parks Department acquired a 45 acre property in the city’s far northeast area intended to be a future community park for thousands of residents in one of the city’s fastest growing communities. The parkland has been on the area’s high priority list for development and funds for this modification, as well as construction of the park scheduled to begin in 2022, are being provided by the Albany Crossing Tax Increment Financing (TIF) subsidy. The use of TIF funding to pay for the design and construction of this park are based on development fees being collected for public improvements during the rapid growth in this area of the city.\n \nIn 2020, Ordinance 0915-2020 authorized a consultant contract to develop a Master Plan for the park by engaging with the surrounding neighborhoods, stakeholders, and departmental staff to determine a preferred layout as well as amenities. This stage also obtained a detailed site inventory, preliminary engineering, and cost estimating. From this plan and report, the department selected priority construction items needed to open the park to the public. This contract modification was anticipated in the initial request for proposals and referenced in the previously authorized Ordinance 0915-2020. Improvements being designed for this park project include athletic fields, walking paths, natural play spaces, shelters, parking areas, a challenge course, and four new connections to surrounding neighborhoods. The project will also include wetland enhancements, forest preservation, and forest expansion. Final plans and permitting will occur in 2021 and construction of the park is set to begin in 2022.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEDGE Group, Inc.\n330 West Spring Street, Suite 350, Columbus, OH  43215\nTedd Hardesty, (614) 486-3343\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 001500, 20-8054208\nMay 8, 2022\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to enable the consultant team to perform the necessary design, plan review, approval, and bidding documents by the end of 2021 as the construction contract will be bid in early 2022.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Ulry Warner Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the entire far northeast region of the city. The scale of park will accommodate a wide range of recreation for all ages and will be accessible to over 4,000 nearby residents. Future subdivision projects underway will add an additional 1,000 residents to the walkshed within the next three years.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since 2014, the local communities have been extensively engaged with the Recreation and Parks Department on the land acquisition and its anticipated uses. The TIF committee charged with prioritizing funds for the community’s infrastructure identified the park as one of the highest priorities for development and worked with the City of Columbus Department of Development to organize the funding. Civic groups involved include Asherton Grove Homeowner Association, Upper Albany West, and Albany Crossing. Two new large subdivisions are currently under construction surrounding the park space.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Rocky Fork-Blacklick (33)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the departments’ Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks, trails, and easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $84,663.16 was legislated for the Ulry Warner Park Improvements project by Ordinance 0915-2020. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $454,533.00. $454,533.00 is budgeted and available from within the Albany Crossing TIF Fund 7441 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $539,196.16.   \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with EDGE Group, Inc. for professional services associated with the final design plans and bidding documents for the Ulry Warner Park Improvements Project, to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate $454,533.00 within the Albany Crossing TIF Fund; to authorize the transfer of $454,533.00 between projects within the Albany Crossing TIF Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $454,533.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
