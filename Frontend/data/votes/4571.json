    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the amendment of Ordinance 1115-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on May 9, 2022.\n \nOrdinance 1115-2022 authorized the Department of Development to accept and execute a reimbursable Healthy Homes Production Grant in an amount up to $2,000,000.00 from the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The grant is being utilized by the Department of Development and Columbus Public Health.  \n \nThe departments use funding from this grant to administer the Healthy Homes Production Grant program.  In the original ordinance, all of the funds were appropriated and expenditures authorized, with an Auditor’s Certificate (ACPO) being created in the amount of $1,192,500.00 for the Department of Development.  The purpose of putting some funds on this ACPO is to carve out funds specifically to pay to remediate the health and safety hazards in low-income families’ homes and to ensure we are meeting grant spending requirements.  The remaining funds are available in the budget for expenses such as personnel, goods, and other services.\n \nThe cost of remediation work in a residence is typically under $50,000.00.  However, there may be instances where the cost is greater than $50,000.00. Remediation includes removal of mold, lead, and other similar toxins.  The department has a list of prequalified contractors who, through a bid rotation system, bid on the work under this program.  After a bidder is chosen from the public bidding process, the department enters into a grant agreement with the homeowner for the work and sets up a purchase order to pay the contractor directly. \n \nColumbus City Code 111.14 states that “All programs which award loans or grants of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) must submit legislation for approval to City Council”. \nThe amendment of Ordinance 1115-2022 would include the following:\n•                     Authorize the Director of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00 to carry out the purpose of the grant program.\n•                     Authorize the Director of Development to create a purchase order for a contractor if the amount is greater than $50,000.00 to carry out the purpose of the grant program.\n \nThis legislation is submitted as an emergency to allow for expenditure of funds to remediate homes as soon as possible to reduce or prevent health issues due to mold, lead, and other similar toxins.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No additional funding is necessary\n \n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance 1115-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on May 9, 2022, to amend the authority given the Director of Development to administer the Healthy Homes Production from the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development by authorizing the Director of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00 and authorize the Director of Development to create a purchase order for a contractor if the amount is greater than $50,000.00, both to carry out the purpose of the grant program; and to declare an emergency.
