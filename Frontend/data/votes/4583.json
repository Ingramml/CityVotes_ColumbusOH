    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $59,695.00 in grant money to fund the 2022-2024 Safe Routes to Schools Program for the period July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2024.\n \nThe overall focus of the grant project will be building City of Columbus' capacity to advance racial equity within bike culture and industry. In collaboration with the Commission on Black Girls, two major activities are planned: (1) formation of a \"Girls in Gear\" team of youth leaders for the Safe Routes to School program, and (2) engagement of two Columbus Safe Routes to School Partnership members in process of racial equity impact assessment.\n \nAn update to the 2015 Safe Routes plan was recently endorsed by the Columbus City Schools Board of Education and submitted for endorsement to Columbus City Council. The proposed activities will complement the ongoing physical changes to the infrastructure in the program's Focus neighborhoods (Linden, Hilltop, Franklinton, South Side and Near East) funded, in part, by Safe Routes to School grant money. The project will leverage existing city plans and staff resources to develop a work plan and manage implementation.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible. Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is fully funded by the Ohio Department of Transportation up to $59,695.00 and does not generate revenue or require a city match.
