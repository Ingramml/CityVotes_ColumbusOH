    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe City of Columbus, Columbus City Attorney’s Office received a $500,000 grant through the United States Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), 2021 Firearms Technical Assistance Project Pilot (FTAP) program. Grant award period: July 1, 2022 through June 30, 2025. \n \nIn 2020, the City Attorney partnered with the Franklin County Prosecutor, Columbus Division of Police, Franklin County Sheriff's Office, Franklin County Municipal Court Pretrial and Probation Services, Capital University Law School’s Civil Protection Unit, LSS CHOICES, and The Center for Family Safety and Healing to secure a National Council of Family and Juvenile Court Judges (NCFJCJ) Firearm Technical Assistance Program (FTAP) award. There was no funding attached to the initial NCFJCJ technical assistance award, but the project team was linked with professional consultants and national experts to improve compliance with firearm laws and regulations for domestic violence offenders. Through the successful work of the FTAP team, Columbus was selected to receive $500,000 in 2021 FTAP grant funds. 2021 FTAP funding will support the Domestic Violence Wrap Around Response pilot. This pilot embeds domestic violence advocates directly with Columbus Division of Police patrol first responders and in the Franklin County Domestic Relations Court's Family Protection Center. These advocates provide safety planning, resource referrals and direct advocacy for victims of domestic violence. Advocates also provide education for law enforcement and court staff on the complexity of domestic violence, domestic violence risk factors and the power and control dynamics often keeping victims in violent and volatile relationships. \nTo achieve the goals and objectives of this pilot project, the City will accept the grant funding then subaward $500,000 to Nationwide Children’s Hospital Research Institute’s (NCHRI- City of Columbus vendor # 006172) Center for Family Safety and Healing. The Center for Family Safety and Healing is a nonprofit dedicated to the wellbeing of children and families. Together with their partners and communities, the Center supports victims of family violence and advocates for social change to prevent abuse. The Center’s vision is to end family violence and create safe and thriving communities. The Center for Family Safety and Healing will work with the Columbus Division of Police and Domestic Relations Court to implement and measure the impact of a “wrap around response” for victims and system providers engaging in the pilot and is responsible for all reporting, training, compliance and other OVW grant requirements presented in the attached subaward contract. \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay program services and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $500,000 in OVW 2021 Firearms Technical Assistance Project Pilot funding from the United States Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women.
