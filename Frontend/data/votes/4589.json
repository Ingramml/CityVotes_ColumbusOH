    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation appropriates funding for the joint Ohio State University (\"OSU\") - Columbus Division of Police (\"CPD\") Crime Interdiction Security Initiative.  A long-standing, mutual-aid collaboration has been in place between both agencies with established guidelines for mutual assistance and use of resources to address criminal activity and emergencies that occur across jurisdictional lines.  One of the provisions of the 2022 MOU is that OSU will reimburse the City of Columbus Division of Police for all overtime and benefit costs for sworn CPD officers who work overtime for initiative activities.  The amount of OSU reimbursement to the City for these costs is $150,000.00 per academic year. However, this amount may be increased based on need and upon mutual agreement by the Parties.  \n \nThe initiative activities and timing are determined via collaborative planning by OSU and CPD personnel.  Examples of law enforcement activity would include student move-in/out times, the start of academic classes and high profile campus events.  The 2022-2023 OSU academic year and the initiative are concurrently scheduled and will begin August 2022.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency legislation is necessary to expedite the appropriation of the funding for the OSU Crime Interdiction Security Initiative in time for the start of project activities to begin in August 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $150,000.00 for CPD sworn overtime expenditures and benefits for the OSU Crime Interdiction Security Initiative.  All funds appropriated are reimbursable from OSU through an OSU-CPD MOU.  The 2015-16 academic year grant-reimbursable expenditures were $137,303.54, the 2016-2017 academic year grant-reimbursable expenditures were $130,837.86, the 2017-2018 academic year grant reimbursable expenditures were $125,670.41, the 2018-2019 academic year grant reimbursable expenditures were $132,676.53, the 2019-2020 academic year grant reimbursable expenditures were $106,176.41, the 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 academic years grant reimbursable expenditures are set at $150,000.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize an appropriation of $150,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grant Fund to the Division of Police; to authorize the Mayor of the City of Columbus to enter into year eight of the OSU Crime Interdiction Security Initiative; and to declare an emergency ($150,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Ohio State University and the City of Columbus Division of Police entered into an MOU establishing guidelines for mutual assistance and use of resources to address criminal activity and emergencies that occur across jurisdictional lines; and,\n \nWHEREAS, The Ohio State University will provide reimbursement to the City of Columbus Division of Police for all overtime and benefit costs for sworn CPD officers who work overtime for the initiative activities, up to a maximum of $150,000.00 per academic year; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an appropriation is needed to cover the costs associated with the academic year 2022-2023 OSU Crime Interdiction Security Initiative; and,\n \nWHEREAS, funds need to be made available at the earliest possible time because the 2022-2023 OSU academic year and Crime Interdiction Security Initiative activities are concurrently scheduled and begin August, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Police, Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize an appropriation of $150,000.00 to cover the costs associated with the academic year 2022-2023 OSU Crime Interdiction Security Initiative, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety and, welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
