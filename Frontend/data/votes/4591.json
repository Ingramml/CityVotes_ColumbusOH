    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety to enter into a contract with Idemia Identity & Security USA, LLC, formally Morpho Trak, Inc., to continue payments for the upgrade and technical support of the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for the Division of Police. \n \nThe City of Columbus entered into an agreement with Morpho Trak, Inc. in 2015 to upgrade the City’s 15 year old AFIS which was at approximately 90 percent capacity on fingerprint inventory.  The agreement required the city to make lease payments to the vender over an eleven year period to cover the cost of the upgrade as well as to provide maintenance and technical support of the new system for the duration of the agreement. The new upgraded system, completed in 2016, provides technology that increases the Division’s latent fingerprint accuracy, meaning it provides the Division tools to help identify suspects quickly and more accurately.  The Division of Police anticipates a significant increase in unsolved latent fingerprint hits just by using newer technology.  The Division will be able to query searches to multiple agencies and databases which includes wanted person, persons of special interest, sexual offenders, and terrorist watch list.   \n \nBid Information:  The initial contract was awarded pursuant to the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code due to the proprietary nature of AFIS technology, and the prohibitive cost of conversion to a different system.\nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nContract Compliance No.: CC028279 thru 3-5-2024\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency legislation is requested for this ordinance so that there are maintenance and service available for the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $963,514.00 to continue payments for the upgraded Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).  The General Fund and Special Income Tax Fund will be used for this expenditure. A total of $991,703.00 was encumbered and spent in the first year of this upgrade for the maintenance and upgrade of the system. The total cost of the AFIS upgrade will be $10.6 million, funded over an eleven (11) year period pursuant to Ordinance 2715-2015.  Half the cost of the entire system will be reimbursed by Franklin County pursuant to Ordinance 2695-2015.  The City of Columbus will fund the annual cost of the AFIS upgrade and then receive reimbursement from Franklin County for their half of the cost. This is year seven (7) of the eleven (11) year period. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into contract with Idemia Identity & Security USA, LLC., to continue payments for the upgraded Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for the Division of Police in accordance with the sole source provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the appropriation of $481,757.00 within the Special Income Tax Debt Fund; to authorize an expenditure of $963,514.00 from the General Fund and Special Income Tax Fund; and to declare an emergency.
