    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance modifies the service contract with Columbus Next Generation Corporation originally authorized by ordinance 1268-2021 and modified by ordinance 3315-2021 for administration of the program providing home repair to address code violations.\n \nColumbus Next Generation (“NextGen”) has been working with The City of Columbus, Office of the City Attorney, and the Franklin County Environmental Courts to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes that are in the court systems (and have been) since prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass.  The homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs.  Their incomes are very limited. In July 2021, City Attorney Zach Klein’s office requested and received grant money in the amount of $100,000 to start the Home Repair Program.  NextGen works with local contractors and encourages minority participation as much as possible.  All contractors are licensed, bonded, have BWC insurance and are registered with the City of Columbus as a contractor (in order to pull necessary permits, if needed, for repairs).  Once repairs are complete, NextGen contacts the City Code Officer that referred properties to the court system to make sure the repairs meet the requirements to close out the current code violations.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an extension of the original contract through December 31, 2023, expands the terms to include interior repairs, increases the available funding by $250,000.00 from the general fund and permits minor administrative changes.\n \nColumbus Next Generation Corporation, FID: 46-2621229 CC#: CC008637, expires 9/22/2022\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the general fund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any disruption in the home repair program.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify an existing contract with Columbus Next Generation Corporation; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the general fund; and to declare an emergency. ($250,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus Next Generation has been working with the City of Columbus Office of the City Attorney and the Franklin County Environmental Court to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes; and\n \nWHEREAS, repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass; and\n \nWHEREAS, the homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Attorney's Office that it is immediately necessary to authorize a contract modification with Columbus NextGen in order to avoid any disruption in the provision of essential, immediate home repairs through the program, for the preservation of the health, safety, and welfare of residents; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Attorney is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with Columbus Next Generation Corporation, originally authorized by ordinance 1268-2021, by extending the expiration date to December 31, 2023, expanding the terms to include interior repairs, adding $250,000.00 of available resources, and to make minor administrative changes.\n \nSECTION 2. That per the action authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $250,000.00 within the general fund, fund 1000, subfund 100010, is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
