    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Franklin County Municipal Court Administrative and Presiding Judge to enter into contract with CourtView Justice Solutions Inc to create a communication interface between the CourtView software and Ohio Community Supervision System (OCSS) and authorizes the expenditure of up to $76,262.00. \n \nOCSS is an automated shared case management software application developed to allow Ohio probation and parole agencies involved in the supervision of defendants/offenders the ability to access the same information. To maintain the integrity of CourtView (the Clerk's file management system), OCSS cannot directly connect to CourtView. CourtView Justice Solutions Inc., has created an interface that will stand as a middleware between CourtView and OCSS and not compromise the integrity of the CourtView software. This middleware will receive data from both systems as well as submit data to each. This interface will allow real time view of current statewide probationer information to CourtView as well as OCSS.  \n \nThis legislation is being submitted in accordance to the City of Columbus bid waiver procurement. It is impractical to change the file management system vendor, so the Court must work with CourtView to integrate the OCSS system.\n \nThe implementation of the OCSS interface will assist the court to improve workflow by utilizing technology and reducing staff time re-keying date and scanning documents into both systems minimizing the delay in communication. These systems will be used by the Court’s Probation Department, Specialized Docket Courts, and the Environmental Court.\n \nEMERGENCY: Emergency legislation is requested to allow the Court to begin the work required to implement use of the interface.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funds are available within the 2022 Specialized Docket Fund Budget.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to enter into contract with CourtView Justice System Inc. to create an interface between CourtView and the OCSS system, maintenance, and setup; to authorize the expenditure of up to $76,262.00; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency. ($76,262.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Court has determined that it is in its best interest to enter into contract with CourtView Justice System because it is impractical to change the file management system vendor, so the Court must work with CourtView to integrate the OCSS system.; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is requested as an emergency to permit the timely procurement of needed services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Franklin County Municipal Court in that it is immediately necessary to authorize and direct the Administrative and Presiding Judge to enter into contract for the interface software, maintenance, and setup with CourtView Justice Solutions Inc. to allow the Court to begin the important work required to implement use of the interface, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; Now, Therefore,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Administrative and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court be and is hereby authorized to enter into contract with CourtView Justice System for the creation of an interface to connect CourtView with the OCSS system, maintenance, and setup.\n \nSECTION 2. That to pay the cost of the aforesaid contract, the expenditure of $76,262.00 or as much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized from the Franklin County Municipal Court, \n \nSECTION 3.  The this Council finds it is in the best interest of  the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code to permit the aforementioned purchase and the same are hereby waived.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
