    "description": "Title\nTo Proclaim, Recognize, and Celebrate September as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month in the City of Columbus\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder in which red blood cells may become sickle-shaped and harden. The severity of SCD varies, with many people facing a shortened life expectancy and a host of recurring, debilitating, and expensive health problems. There is no universal cure for this condition, also SCD disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans; and\n \nWHEREAS, SCD affects our population unevenly. Black and Brown Americans are disproportionately affected. About 1 in 13 Black children tests positive for the sickle cell trait, and about 1 in 365 Black Americans develops the disease over the course of their lifetime.  Due to persistent systemic inequities in our health care system, these same patients are also often the last to get help; and \n \nWHEREAS, Information about detecting this disease is not always widely shared, and pain management can be a challenge due to the intermittent nature of sickle cell crises and persistent racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment; and \n \nWHEREAS, It is important for us all to better understand the signs of this disease, the risks of inheriting this condition, as well as the various resources available to those who test positive.  Most people with the sickle cell trait do not exhibit symptoms, and many are unaware of their potential to carry on this gene; and\n \nWHEREAS, As we continue our quest to cure sickle cell disease, let us celebrate the strides our health experts have made in understanding and treating this condition.  Let us offer strength to those Americans fighting its effects today and unite in our mission to enhance the quality of life for those diagnosed with SCD; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council proclaims, recognizes, and celebrates September as National Sickle Cell Awareness Month in Columbus the City of Columbus",
