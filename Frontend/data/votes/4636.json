    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and celebrate National Drive Electric Week 2022 in Columbus, Ohio and thank Columbus Yellow Cab and CleanFuels Ohio for their partnership in creating the Decentralized Mobility Ecosystem hub.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, National Drive Electric Week 2022, which takes place September 23rd through October 2nd, celebrates the transition to hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles by drivers across the country; and\n \nWHEREAS, hybrid electric vehicles typically use less fuel than similar conventional vehicles because they employ electric-drive technologies to boost vehicle efficiency through regenerative braking-recapturing energy otherwise lost during braking. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles, are both capable of being powered solely by electricity; and\n \nWHEREAS, electric and hybrid vehicles can have significant emissions benefits over conventional vehicles. All-electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions when operating in all-electric mode; and\n \nWHEREAS, more than two million electric vehicles have been sold in the United States, and 96% of EV drivers report that they will purchase another EV for their next vehicle, according to a recent survey by Plug In America; and\n \nWHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Energy selected Clean Fuels Ohio for a $1.36 million project, conducted from 2019 to 2022, to explore new, innovative solutions to transportation, energy, and technology integration challenges. This project created a decentralized and electrified mobility ecosystem, in partnership with Columbus Yellow Cab’s growing fleet of Electric Vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, Drive Electric Columbus will host an event on October 1st, from 10am-2pm at the headquarters of Columbus Yellow Cab. The location features one of the Decentralized Mobility Ecosystem hubs; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate Drive Electric Week from September 23rd to October 2nd, 2022 and encourages members of our community to attend the Drive Electric Columbus event on Saturday, October 1st, 2022.",
