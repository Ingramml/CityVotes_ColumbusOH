    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Historic Resources Commission (HRC) (CC 3117) is charged, in part, with identifying districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects that are of significance to the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation; maintaining a list of these districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects; and providing regulation of these properties through design review. With these goals in mind, the Commission provides recommendations to City Council for the potential listing of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties. \n \nAn application has been made by Susan Keeny /Columbus Landmarks (Applicant), in cooperation with Columbus Landmarks (Owner), to list the property located at 1725 South Parsons Avenue, Nagy Brothers Shoe Repair, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties. The subject building is locally significant for its embodiment of, “ethnic contributions to the cultural, social, and economic development” of the city, and “the stories and the ethnic history of an area” by “ordinary people who contributed significantly to the growth of Columbus” (Keeny p. 1). The period of significance for the building is 1932-2009, from when the property was constructed in 1932 as a brick filling station, and with a 1948 cinder block addition added when the building was converted to use as a shoe repair shop. The Columbus Register boundary for the property consists of the entire Parcel, (Franklin County Parcel #010-057403-00), and including the property historically associated with the 1932-2009 Nagy Brothers Shoe Repair. This corner property’s boundary begins at the southwest corner of Hinman and Parsons Avenues, extends west for 130 feet to the alley named Goethe Avenue, then extends south for 31 feet, and then extends east for 130 feet to Parsons Avenue. \n \nProper notice was given to the property owner, per CC 3117.061, and a signed and notarized owner consent form has been received. A public hearing was held July 21, 2022, per CC 3117.063. The public hearing was attended by the Applicant and the Owner, who provided comments in support of the listing of the property. \n \nThe Commission voted unanimously to recommend listing of the property located at 1725 South Parsons Avenue, Nagy Brothers Shoe Repair, on the Columbus Register based on the following criteria outlined in CC 3117.05: \n \nCriterion A: “The design or style of the property’s exterior and/or interior is of significance to the historical, architectural or cultural development of the city, state or nation”. \n \nCriterion B: “The property is closely and publicly identified with a person who has significantly contributed to the historical, architectural or cultural development of the city, state, or nation”. \n \nCriterion E: “The property is closely and publicly identified with an event, or series of events, which has influenced the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation”. \nListing of this property on the Columbus Register will facilitate its eligibility for historic tax credits in conjunction with the planned rehabilitation and adaptive use of the building. \n \nThis legislation is submitted as 30- Day to allow its incorporation in a historic tax credit application. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None \n \nTitle\n \nTo list the property at 1725 South Parsons Avenue, Nagy Brothers Shoe Repair, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties as CR #82, including the 1932 and 1948 sections of the building. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Historic Resources Commission is charged, in part, with identifying districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects of significance to the historical, architectural, or cultural development of the city, state, or nation; and \n \nWHEREAS, as part of this responsibility, the commission provides recommendations to City Council for the potential listing of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties; and \n \nWHEREAS, an application has been made by Susan Keeny /Columbus Landmarks (Applicant), in cooperation with Columbus Landmarks (Owner),to list the property located at 1725 South Parsons Avenue, Nagy Brothers Shoe Repair, on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties; and \n \nWHEREAS, notice was given, as required by City Code, and a public hearing regarding the application was held on July 21, 2022; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Historic Resources Commission has determined that 1725 South Parsons Avenue, Nagy Brothers Shoe Repair, is eligible for listing on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties under criteria listed in CC 3117.05, and therefore recommends approval of the nomination to Columbus City Council; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSection 1.
