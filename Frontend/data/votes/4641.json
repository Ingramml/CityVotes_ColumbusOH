    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a reimbursement agreement with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to facilitate the resurfacing and rehabilitation of certain public roadways within the City in conjunction with planned infrastructure improvements being administered by the County.  It also authorizes the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funding needed to complete the Columbus portion of the work.\nThe Department of Public Service and the Franklin County Engineer’s Office have a long-standing collaborative relationship when transportation related capital improvements span both jurisdictions.  Recently, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office proposed undertaking a series of smaller projects encompassing road maintenance and rehabilitation and other planned improvements adjacent to portions of the Columbus transportation network.  As is customary, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office asked if the Department of Public Service planned upcoming projects in these areas to determine if it would be economically beneficial to the City to combine projects with Franklin County and do the work as one project instead of separate projects.  The Department of Public Service agreed it was more economical and efficient to improve portions of the Columbus transportation network adjacent to the proposed Franklin County improvements while Franklin County completes those improvements.  In these instances, one of the parties initiates and manages the capital improvement project and related contracts for the work within both jurisdictions, while the other party contributes funding for the part of the project that lies within its jurisdiction.  It was decided Franklin County would manage and hold the contracts for the proposed projects, as the majority of the work would be performed in its jurisdiction.  The Department of Public Service is to reimburse Franklin County for the portion of work performed within the City of Columbus.\nOrdinance 0831-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to execute a reimbursement agreement with the Franklin County Engineer’s Office in an amount up to $250,000.00 for improving portions of the Columbus transportation network adjacent to proposed Franklin County improvements. The work encompasses resurfacing portions of Obetz Road, Lockbourne Road, and Snouffer Road.  That amount was based on the estimate of the cost of the work at that time.  Since then, the estimated cost of the Columbus portion of the work has increased to $275,000.00, requiring the City to modify the reimbursement agreement and increase the City's contribution an additional $25,000.00.  \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $25,000.00 are available in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service and are appropriated.  It is necessary to amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget to align budget authority with the proper project.\n3.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to reimburse another government agency and as such is not an expenditure that falls under this program. \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to satisfy its financial commitment as soon as reasonably practicable so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of planned improvements.  \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a reimbursement agreement with and contribute funding to the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to resurface City streets in a project administered by Franklin County; to authorize the expenditure of up to $25,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for this project; and to declare an emergency.  ($25,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office previously proposed constructing, or causing the construction of, various public infrastructure improvements, some of which are immediately adjacent to City of Columbus roadways;

and \nWHEREAS, the estimated cost of the City portion of that work, which encompasses resurfacing portions of Obetz Road, Lockbourne Road, and Snouffer Road, is now expected to cost $275,000.00; and \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the execution of a modification to the existing reimbursement agreement between the aforementioned entities and the encumbrance and expenditure of the additional sum of $25,000.00 to support the City share of estimated construction and inspection costs; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned expenditure; and\n \nWHEREAS, this expenditure is to reimburse another government agency and as such is not an expenditure that falls under the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise Program; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this ordinance to allow the Department of Public Service to satisfy its financial commitment as soon as reasonably practicable so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of planned improvements, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;
