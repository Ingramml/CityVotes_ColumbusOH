    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Mulch Supply, Inc. to provide a biosolids beneficial reuse program, known as the Deep Row Hybrid Poplar (DRHP) program, for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD). Ohio Mulch operates the DRHP program on its 1,012-acre New Lexington Tree Farm, LLC (NLTF) in Perry Township, Perry County, Ohio.\n \nThis contract originally authorized Ohio Mulch Supply, Inc. to remove a minimum of 27,000 and up to a maximum of 30,000 wet tons of biosolids annually from the Jackson Pike and Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) and reuse the biosolids in the DRHP program. Modification No. 3 adjusted the terms by increasing the rate of the first 0-30,000 wet tons removed to $40.00 per wet ton, and for volumes 30,001 or more wet tons to $35.00 per wet ton. Modification No. 9 further modified the terms, setting rates for removal of the first 0-30,000 wet tons at $46.97 per wet ton and volumes of 30,001 or more wet tons at $41.10 per wet ton. Modification No. 10 extends the contract for six months through June 30, 2023 under the same pricing terms.\n \nAll biosolids removed from the WWTPs under the program are Class B dewatered biosolids, which are produced from the stabilization of primary and secondary wastewater solids that have been digested to meet strict OEPA volatile solids and disease vector reduction requirements. Ohio Mulch utilizes the biosolids as a nitrogen source to grow hybrid poplar trees, which are later harvested for mulch. Additionally, the biosolids add valuable organic material to the old abandoned mine site that is now repurposed as the New Lexington Tree Farm. Ohio Mulch utilizes approximately 30 acres per year at the tree farm site, with trees harvested every 6 to 8 years. \n \nThe Director of Public Utilities received the Ohio Mulch, Inc. proposal on April 15, 2011 in response to a Request for Proposals for an innovative reuse of biosolids program. It was the only proposal received with the DRHP concept. Other proposals included mechanized dryer processes that would dry and pelletize biosolids for commercial wholesale and biosolids-cake land application proposals. The selection committee deemed Ohio Mulch’s DRHP the best fit for the DOSD Biosolids Program.  \n \nThe terms for the contract award allowed for two continuation options after the first 30 months elapsed: one running for a total of five-years (including the 30 months prior) and another running for ten years (also including the initial 30 months). The latter option was chosen and has undergone a few revisions over its duration to account for unexpected transportation and operational costs. Rates were increased at various times, as mentioned above, and Ohio Mulch Supply, Inc. was required to construct a biosolids storage facility at the NLTF capable of storing 1,000 wet tons of biosolids by January 1, 2016.\n \nThis proposed modification #10 is for an unplanned additional half year of the contract in response to unforeseen issues in advertising new bids. It extends the contract through June 30, 2023 under the same pricing terms. \n                     \nThis ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nOhio Mulch Supply, Inc. | Federal EIN 31-1120540 | D365 Vendor #004715 | Expires 12/14/2023\nOhio Mulch does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $0\n \n$1,000,687.13 has been spent in 2022\n$1,167,743.96 was spent in 2021\n$1,141,866 was spent in 2020\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and extend the contract with Ohio Mulch Supply, Inc. for services in connection with the Deep Row Hybrid Poplar Program for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.
