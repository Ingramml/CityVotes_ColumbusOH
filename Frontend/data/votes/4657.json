    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1940-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on July 25, 2022, to allow for payment of services starting September 1, 2022, and to further clarify the type of agreement.  \n \nOrdinance 1940-2022 authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a subaward agreement with Equitas Health to provide housing services for people living with HIV/AIDS using 2022 Housing Opportunity for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) funds from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n \nHistorically, the HOPWA grant has been managed and administered by Columbus Public Health (CPH).  Starting with the 2022 grant year funds, the HOPWA grant will be managed and administered by the Department of Development (DOD), Division of Housing.  In early 2022, CPH put forth Ordinance 0919-2022 to enter into an agreement with Equitas Health to provide HOPWA services.  That ordinance and agreement provided a portion of the funds needed for the 2022 program year.  This agreement, under the authority of the Director of Development, will be an original agreement with Equitas Health and will provide additional funding for the remainder of the year.\n \nTo provide continuous services under this program, Development’s agreement needs to begin after Columbus Public Health’s ends.  CPH’s agreement ended August 31, 2022, when all funds had been expended for services provided.  Development anticipates that their contract will be fully executed by mid-September.  To prevent a gap in service, Development’s agreement needs to allow for payment of services starting September 1, 2022.\n \nThe correct name for the agreement being entered into is a “subaward grant agreement”.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  is requested to support the approved emergency designation of Ordinance No. 1940-2022.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004721 and expires 1/25/2024\n \nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 1940-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on July 25, 2022, to allow for payment of services starting September 1, 2022 and to further clarify the type of agreement; and to declare an emergency.
