    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify an agreement with the Community Shelter Board for the administration of the City's ESG-CV2 monies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to extend the time allowed to expend the funds and to further define the type of agreement as a “subward grant agreement.”\n \nThe City of Columbus received a letter of the awarded allocation dated June 9, 2020, from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for these special Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG-CV) Program funds. The letter states that “HUD is allocating to your jurisdiction the amount of $8,102,095.00, as authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), Public Law 116-136.”  Recently, HUD announced that the expenditure of these funds have been extended one year, to September 30, 2023.\n \nThese special ESG-CV2 funds are to be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) among individuals and families who are homeless or receiving homeless assistance, and to support additional homeless assistance and homelessness prevention activities to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19.\n \nThe Community Shelter Board (CSB), a non-profit organization, has been selected because of their history with the city and the homeless service community in the funding and coordination of services to homeless individuals and families as well as their established administrative procedures to effectively and efficiently implement such services.  CSB is a recipient of the City’s regular ESG allocation of funds from HUD.\n \nThe Community Shelter Board (CSB) will work with its partners to continue to operate a shelter for isolation and quarantine to care for people experiencing homelessness who have COVID-19 or have been exposed. They will continue operation of the social distancing shelters and the isolation and quarantine shelter.\n \nUse of funds for the temporary shelters will include ESG-eligible Operations and Essential Services costs, including staffing, transportation, space, security, environmental services, laundry, food, and supplies.\n \nOriginal                                          $8,102,095.00                     Ord. 2628-2020                                          PO254902\nMod 1                                          $              0.00\nTotal                                          $8,102,095.00\n \nEmergency legislation is needed in order to continue implementation of efforts to respond to the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on behalf of persons experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  no funding impact\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number 004795 and expires 1/10/2024\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify an agreement with the Community Shelter Board for the administration of the City's ESG-CV2 monies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to extend the time allowed to expend the funds and to further define the type of agreement as a “subward grant agreement”; and to declare an emergency.
