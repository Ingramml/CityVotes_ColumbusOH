    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $300,000.00 for the Transitional Housing Pilot Program.  This one-year contract will commence on September 12, 2022.   \n \nThe City of Columbus is committed to supporting our shelter system and improving the systems that support people experiencing homelessness. However, people with histories of living on the land are our hardest to find and hardest to serve. This pilot is being made available to these individuals so we can better understand equitable options for people who have not successfully exited our shelter system. This program will help prepare individuals to take on permanent housing and its’ responsibility. For the participants, it provides them a mailing address, access to a telephone, relief from inclement weather, and the opportunity to prioritize the long term goals of health and housing security.\n \nPilot participants will receive hotel lodging, material assistance, and individualized case management as they work to transition into subsidized rental or permanent supportive housing. The goal of the pilot is to evaluate interventions that provide a short-term safe space for individuals living on the land as they work toward securing long-term, stable housing. The pilot will be managed by the Community Shelter Board, with Equitas Health providing on-site case management tailored to the needs of each individual. \n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested to provide these essential services to people experiencing homelessness without interruption.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Neighborhood Economic Development fund (2237).\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The contract compliance number for Community Shelter Board is 004795 and expires on 01/10/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $300,000.00 for the Transitional Housing Pilot Program, to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $300,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development fund; and to declare an emergency.
