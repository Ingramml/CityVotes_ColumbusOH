    "description": "Title\n \nTo endorse the Senior Services Levy on the Tuesday, November 8, 2022 ballot as Issue 10.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the residents of Franklin County will be considering a Senior Services Levy known as Issue 10 on Tuesday, November 8, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS this levy funds Franklin County Senior Options which provides services and programs designed to help seniors remain safely at home; and \n \nWHEREAS, these services include meals-on-wheels, transportation to the doctor and emergency response buttons; and\n \nWHEREAS, passage of this levy will mean that Senior Options will continue to serve over 60,000 seniors in 2023 with a 3% increase each year of the levy cycle; and\n \nWHEREAS, the costs for helping seniors, age 60 and older, maintain independent living is far smaller than the costs of institutional or nursing home care; and\n \nWHEREAS, this levy also supports the demand for safe housing services such as minor home repair modifications, and other safety products, to allow seniors to live in their home free of barriers and unsafe conditions; and \n \nWHEREAS, given the certainty of increased demand for services, a larger safety net is needed for our community to avoid seniors getting into crisis; and\n \nWHEREAS, the current senior services levy will expire at the end of 2022. The senior levy is the sole funding source for Senior Options programs. Without the passage of this levy, Senior Options will end access to valuable services; and\n \nWHEREAS, passage of this levy is not a tax increase; \n \nWHEREAS, a request has been made to put a $1.75 million senior services levy renewal on the November 8, 2022 ballot and this is not a tax increase; now therefore, \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council hereby endorses the Franklin County Senior Services Levy and encourages all Franklin County voters to Vote FOR Issue 10 to continue vital services for senior citizens in our community.",
