This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $130,000.00.\n \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to continue testing and inspection on the Confluence Parking Garage and allow continuity of inspection throughout the project duration.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00                     (PO223531, Ord. 0724-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $500,000.00                     (PO295449, Ord. 2359-2021)\nThe total of Modification No. 2                                                                                    $130,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $1,130,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CTL Engineering.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for CTL Engineering is CC004209 and expires 05/20/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 5518, the Construction Inspection Fund.  \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of this program and as such is not a part of the program. \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the needed inspection and testing services to continue uninterrupted, preventing delays in the Department of Public Service’s capital improvement projects and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with CTL Engineering in connection with the Roadway - Materials Testing and Inspection 2020 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $130,000.00 from the Construction Inspection Fund to pay for the modification; and to declare an emergency.  ($130,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
