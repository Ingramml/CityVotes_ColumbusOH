    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with the Gateway Film Foundation and the Short North Alliance in support of community arts events.\n \nBeginning in January, the Gateway Film Center will present “Pioneers of African-American Cinema,” a 2023 Winter Season collection of the works of America's legendary first African-American filmmakers. The program is a partnership with Kino Lorber, the Greater Columbus Arts Council, and the Black Ohio Film Group. This unique partnership will feature selected feature films and short films, on screen at the Film Center, and a Gallery at Gateway Film Center installation featuring video and still images from hundreds of hours of \"lost\" films created by early 20th century African-American filmmakers.\n \nCurated by Gateway Film Center CEO Christopher Hamel, Charles Musser (Yale University), Jacqueline Najuma Stewart (University of Chicago) and Columbus artist Marshall Shorts, and produced in association with the Library of Congress, the British Film Institute, the George Eastman Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Archives, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Southern Methodist University, and the UCLA Film & Television Archive, this program is essential viewing for patrons and supporters around the world. In 2023, from January 5 through March 23, audiences will come together to discover and celebrate these bold, creative filmmakers and their amazing and largely unseen works.\n \nThe Short North Alliance (SNA) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization serving both the property owners and business owners of the Short North Arts District. The mission of the Short North Alliance is to nurture the Short North Arts District as a vibrant, creative, and inclusive community and leading arts destination.\n \nOne of the ways the SNA raises money for its members is through festivals and community events. These events, including Highball Halloween, draw thousands of visitors from throughout the Central Ohio region to help reinforce the image of the Short North neighborhood as one of the premier economic drivers in the State of Ohio. Highball Halloween is billed as “the nation’s most elaborate costume party…bridging runway style with the culture of the Short North Arts District.” This year’s Highball Halloween takes place on October 22, 2022.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available to support these grants within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested to ensure that funding is available to organizations in advance of the supported events. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with the Gateway Film Foundation and the Short North Alliance in support of community arts events; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
