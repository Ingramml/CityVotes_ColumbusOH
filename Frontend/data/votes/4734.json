    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to move available appropriation between object classes within a fund and department during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 21, 2022, if necessary, for any funds not already identified in Ordinances 2741-2021, 2742-2021, and 2743-2021. The aforementioned ordinances established annual appropriations for the 12 months ending December 31, 2022 for the General Fund, Other Funds, and Select Other Funds. In addition to establishing annual appropriations, these ordinances also provide limited authority for the City Auditor to move available appropriation pursuant to review and approval by the Director of the submitting department, the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, the Chairperson of the Committee of Finance, and the City Auditor. This ordinance extends this limited authority to funds not subject to the aforementioned annual appropriation ordinances adopted by City Council for the 12 months ending December 31, 2022.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency consideration is requested so that necessary appropriation adjustments can be processed as quickly as possible, thereby supporting timely and efficient fiscal operations and processes.\n \nFiscal Impact: No specific appropriation or expenditure of funds is required by this ordinance.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to move available appropriation between object classes within a fund and department during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 21, 2022, if necessary, for any funds not already identified in Ordinances 2741-2021, 2742-2021, and 2743-2021; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinances 2741-2021, 2742-2021, and 2743-2021 established annual appropriations for the 12 months ending December 31, 2022 for the General Fund, Other Funds, and Select Other Funds; and \nWHEREAS, in addition to establishing annual appropriations, these ordinances also provide limited authority for the City Auditor to move available appropriation pursuant to review and approval by the Director of the submitting department, the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, the Chairperson of the Committee of Finance, and the City Auditor; and   \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to extend this limited authority to funds not specifically identified in the aforementioned ordinances (for the 12 months ending December 31, 2022) in order to provide for efficient fiscal management; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to make certain appropriation adjustments to ensure timely and efficient fiscal operations of the City, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer available appropriations within a fund and department, if necessary, from any object class with available appropriations for any funds not already identified in Ordinances 2741-2021, 2742-2021, and 2743-2021 during the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, pursuant to review and approval by the Director of the submitting department, the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, the Chairperson of the Committee of Finance, and the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 2.
