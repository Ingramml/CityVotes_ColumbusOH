    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Tyevco for the Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot and Site Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $8,000.00.\n \nThe Cultural Arts Center (CAC) Parking Lot is mainly used for Columbus Recreation and Parks Department staff and program participants. This facility and lot also hosts guests during special events, including festivals, weddings, and other special engagements. The Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot is constructed of brick pavers, including both historical pavers and new replacement pavers. Over time, areas of the brick paver lot have warped from the force applied from vehicles making turns, causing bricks to pop out and expose the subgrade of the parking lot. The damaged parking lot poses significant safety issues and trip hazards, increasing the chance for pedestrians to fall and/or twist ankles. Leaving the damaged lot as is will also accelerate further damage and increasing safety hazards. The parking lot was repaired within the last five years but the repair was insufficient in addressing the problem causing the brick pavers to warp out of place. This contract will construct a long term and resilient solution for the brick paver parking lot. The historical brick pavers will be preserved and the warped brick paver lot will be repaired using a more heavy-duty detail. Additionally, a concrete pad and 4 bike racks will be installed as part of these improvements. \n \nBy modifying this contract, unanticipated electrical conflicts found in the field will be mitigated to allow for the construction work to proceed per plan. This modification will allow Tyevco to perform additional work to relocate existing utility conflicts that were discovered once construction started. Advertising to another bidder will not yield a desired result as Tyevco has a strong project understanding and has the team to address the issues efficiently since they are already on site.  The prices for modification were negotiated with the contractor and were based on time, material, and overhead costs already established by the existing contract. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTyevco Inc.\n1678 West Audubon Boulevard\nLancaster, Ohio 43130                                                      \nScott Boggess, 614-284-0251                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005691, 31-1626034\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 27, 2023       \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as construction work is currently underway and this will allow the contractor to perform the necessary additional work while already on site.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The improvements to the parking lot will increase safety for all Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot users and will mitigate long term damage to the existing historical brick paver lot. The bike racks will promote multi-modal transportation to the facility.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Staff and visitors at the Cultural Arts Center have advocated for parking lot improvements after the latest treatment has not lasted and the lot has become unsafe.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Downtown (55)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by helping to ensure that facilities remain safe and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $ $50,000.00 was legislated for the Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot and Site Improvements Project by Ordinance 0656-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $8,000.00. $8,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $58,000.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Tyevco for the Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot and Site Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $8,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $8,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
