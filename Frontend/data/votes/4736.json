    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Midstates Recreation for the 2020 Playground Improvements - Phase 3 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $95,350.47.\n \nThe 2020 Playground Improvements - Phase 3 Project focuses upon providing safe and accessible play opportunities for children throughout the City. This project includes the removal of playgrounds at Wrexham Park, Cody Park, and Westgate Park. It also includes the full replacement of playgrounds at Northeast Park, Howard Community Center, and the Retreat at Turnberry Shelterhouse. A new playground installation at the Big Walnut Park Shelterhouse is also part of the project. At Whetstone Park, rubberized safety surfacing and underground storm drainage will be repaired and replaced as well.\n \nThis modification includes the installation of a playground at Driving Park that will be a community install. The Department is requesting to modify an existing construction contract with Midstates Recreation for installation services for the Volunteer Community Build at Driving Park. Additional costs associated with the community build installation of the playground at Driving Park were not anticipated when this project was originally bid. This change is needed as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency delaying the opportunity to work with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Using this existing contract will provide the most economical and efficient outcome for the added scope. The Playground Improvements at Driving Park are a part of the Columbus Blue Jackets Foundation Grant awarded to the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department to help fund the replacement of two playgrounds per year between 2017 and 2020. The new playground at Driving Park replaces outdated existing playground equipment. The playground will be installed with the assistance of volunteers from the Columbus Blue Jackets and the local Community.    \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMichigan Playgrounds DBA Midstates Recreation\n1279 Hazelton Etna Road SW\nPataskala, Ohio 43062\nBlake Hobson (614) 855-3790                                                 \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 000552, 11-3732875\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 7, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure that construction stays on schedule and is substantially complete by the end of summer 2022, prior to colder temperatures.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Safe and accessible playgrounds are one of the core priorities of the Recreation and Parks Department.
