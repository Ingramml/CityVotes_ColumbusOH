    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) Transportation Alternative Program to build a significant section of the Big Walnut Greenway on the far east side of the city, from Nafzger Park near Refugee Road to Big Walnut Park near East Main Street.    \n \nMORPC is accepting applications for federal funds for bike and pedestrian improvements, including regional trail projects.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to submit a grant application to MORPC to build a significant section of the Big Walnut Greenway on the Far East side of the city, from Nafzger Park  near Refugee Road to Big Walnut Park near East Main Street. This area of the City has very few bike and pedestrian facilities. It also rates on the High Injury Network as a dangerous area to bike or walk.\n \nFive neighborhood connections would be added, providing connectivity for over 50,000 residents to the regional network. All of the alignment will be separated trail. Several key destinations will be linked by this project. These destinations include job and commercial centers, including Eastland, the Hamilton Road Corridor, and the East Main Street Corridor. It also includes three major city parks, including Helsel, Nafzger, and Big Walnut Parks, as well as, the Far East Community Center. Five communities are also connected, including Blacklick Estates, Walnut Heights, Eastland, Pine Hills, and Shady Lane. Two future Linkus transit stops at Livingston Avenue and East Main Street will also be connected.  16 schools are within a one mile walkshed.\n \nA key result will be overcoming substantial barriers to biking and walking. The project will build four major trail infrastructure improvements, including underpasses beneath I-270 and I-70, an underpass beneath the Norfolk Southern railway, and a new pedestrian bridge connecting the Walnut Hills and Woodcrest Communities to the Far East Community Center, Walnut Ridge High School, and Big Walnut Park.  This project is a collaborative effort with the Cities of Whitehall and Gahanna. When completed, over 12 miles of greenway corridor will be connected.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission                      \n111 Liberty Street\nColumbus, Ohio  43215                                                        \nWilliam Murdock, Director, (614) 228-2663                                                    \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004591, 31-1009675\nMarch 25, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to obtain approval to apply for this grant as this legislation is required to be submitted with the grant request package and the application will be submitted as soon as possible upon approval of this ordinance. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active transportation opportunities provide highly recognized year-round benefits to urban lifestyles.

Three major employment centers, three parks, 16 schools, and some of the city’s most scenic natural areas will also be connected to this trail as proposed. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Department has received letters of support from the community, the Central Ohio Greenways organization, civic associations, area commissions, and city-wide trail users.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far East (58), South East (65)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors while providing safe east-west connections for nearby neighborhoods to the regional trail network.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time.
