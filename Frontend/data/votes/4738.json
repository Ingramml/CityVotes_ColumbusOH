($400,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a renewal of the contract with Roberts Service Group, Inc. for electric power system maintenance services for Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage facilities.  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU) has various electric power equipment at the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD), the Division of Power (DOP), and the Division of Water (DOW) that requires maintenance services. This equipment is located throughout the facilities associated with DPU’s sewage and storm water collection systems and water distribution system, including at the two (2) Wastewater Treatment Plants, Compost Facility, Sewer Maintenance Operations Center, and three (3) Water Treatment Plants. The equipment is also located at various electric substations that service the City of Columbus and its satellite communities.  \n \nThe work performed under the current contract is for electric power distribution systems and their components that require inspection, testing, maintenance, and repair or replacement, with the majority of the work for industrial equipment and systems ranging from 120V to 15.5 kV. The contract also covers inspection, testing, maintenance, and repair or replacement work on equipment and systems >15.5 kV to 138 kV that requires a contractor or subcontractor with highly specialized experience in high voltage equipment.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities advertised Request for Proposals for the subject services in the City Bulletin in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code. Two hundred and two (202) vendors were solicited (RFQ10714), and four (4) proposals were received and opened on November 7, 2018. Roberts Service Group, Inc. was determined to be the most qualified responder to provide the necessary electric power system maintenance services.   \n \nThe original contract, PO153604, was established for a period of one (1) year with three (3) additional one (1) year renewal options contingent upon mutual agreement, availability of funding and approval by Columbus City Council. A recent modification was enacted to extend the contract to allow the Division of Power to repair a failed substation that supports the O’Shaughnessy Dam. That modification #2 extended the contract six (6) months to July 16, 2023. This renewal #4 adds funding to support DOSD’s electric power system maintenance service needs throughout the additional six months, including switching station inspections and repairs at the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant. All terms and conditions of the original agreement remain in full force and effect.   \n \n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds:  Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal #4 is ADD $400,000.00 Total contract amount including this modification is $6,526,921.00.\n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  An unplanned modification and extension of the contract was enacted because of a failed substation that supports the O’Shaughnessy Dam. At the time, the modification only included funding for the Division of Power. This renewal is because the Division of Sewerage and Drainage needs to add funding for its general electric power system maintenance needs over the additional six months of the contract.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes not used:  The work under this renewal is within the scope of the original bid contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.                     How cost was determined:  The cost is in accordance with current market conditions for the necessary services and equipment.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nRoberts Service Group, Inc. | Federal EIN 31-0858835 | D365 Vendor #004397 | Expires 8/24/2023\nRoberts Service Group, Inc. holds WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$400,000.00 is budgeted and needed for this contract renewal for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \n$563,289.01 has been spent in 2022\n$612,130.45 was spent in 2021 \n$512,833.54 was spent in 2020 \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the electric power system maintenance services contract with Roberts Service Group, Inc. for the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage, and to authorize the expenditure of $400,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund.
