    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe City of Columbus Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire needs to modify existing contracts with vendors associated with the City’s Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT). RREACT is an innovative outreach service operated by the Division of Fire to actively address the opioid crisis negatively impacting far too many Columbus residents.  RREACT outreach includes firefighters/paramedics, Crisis Intervention Team certified peace officers, a substance use case manager, a registered SUD nurse, a family case manager, and a trauma specialist. RREACT proactively connects and builds relationships with opioid users to 1) forge treatment and recovery pathways for users, and 2) provide multi-sector social service navigation and trauma counseling for children and other caregivers in the home. This multi-disciplinary outreach team goes directly into communities to connect with individuals who survive overdose (after Narcan© administration) but then refuse EMS transport to the emergency room. At these follow up meetings, team members assess immediate health needs, provide resource referrals, and create opportunities for users and family/household members to link with harm reduction supplies, treatment programs, trauma services, and social benefit supports.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Public Safety on behalf of the Division of Fire to modify RREACT Case Management service contracts with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center dba Primary One in the amount of $48,669.77 and Alina Sharafutdinova in the amount of $50,000.00;  this ordinance also authorizes the City Auditor to transfer funds between object levels for CDC Grant Project G342000 in the amount of $48,669.77 to match expenditures with appropriation.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency so these important program services can continue without interruption. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $98,669.77 from the General Government Grants Fund, $48,669.77.00 via Project G342000 United States Centers for Disease Control Overdose Data to Action, and $50,000.00 via Project G342100 Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Site-based Program (COSSAP); a transfer of funds between object levels is necessary to fund the CDC Grant Project G342000 expenditure.  A total of $72,534.00 has been expended with Primary One in 2021 and 2022 - a total of $121,203.77 will be spent with Primary One upon approval of this modification.  Approximately $50,000.00 has been expended with Alina Sharafutdinova thus far in 2022 ~ this modification will authorize a total of $100,000.00 for her services.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer $48,669.77 between object levels of Grant Project G342000; to authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to modify existing contracts with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center dba PrimaryOne Health, and Alina Sharafutdinova for healthcare and project management services, respectively, to authorize the expenditure of $98,669.77 from the General Government Grants Fund 2220; and to declare an emergency.
