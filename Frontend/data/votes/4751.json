    "title": "To amend Ordinance 1644-2022, passed on July 11, 2022 to continue the gunfire detection alert program with ShotSpotter Inc. by repealing Section 1 and replacing it with a new Section 1 thereby modifying the term of contract; and to declare an emergency ($0.00)",
    "description": "BACKGROUND: This ordinance is necessary to amend Ordinance 1644-2022, passed July 11, 2022 which authorized the Public Safety Director to modify the contract with ShotSpotter, Inc. to continue a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis program, a subscription based service that involves the installation of a gunfire sensor network in areas identified by the City. These sensors connect to a cloud-based data center infrastructure, providing a 24/7/365 gunfire monitoring service within a nine (9) square-mile radius of the installed sensor infrastructure.\nThis amendment is necessary in order to authorize a 36 month extension with annual funding contingent upon approval each year of the three year contract by City Council and the Auditor's certification of funds. The original ordinance 1644-2022 authorized a one year extension instead of 36 months. \n \nThis ordinance is considered an emergency measure in that it is immediately necessary to amend the previous ordinance to allow the services to continue without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The original ordinance, 1644-2022 passed on July 11, 2022, encumbered $840,000.00 for one year's payment of $210,000.00 for a three-mile radius and $630,000.00 for a 6 mile radius of coverage.  This amendment merely amends the term of the contract and needs no associated encumbrance.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance 1644-2022, passed on July 11, 2022 to continue the gunfire detection alert program with ShotSpotter Inc. by repealing Section 1 and replacing it with a new Section 1 thereby modifying the term of contract; and to declare an emergency ($0.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety has determined to continue use of the gunfire detection, alert and analysis service to assist law enforcement responding to incidents of gunfire in Columbus Neighborhoods; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 1644-2022 passed on July 11, 2022 authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a contract with ShotSpotter Inc. for the gunfire detection program for a period of one year; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance amends Ordinance 1644-2022 by modifying the term of the contract from one year to 36 months with annual funding contingent upon the approval each year of the three year contract by City Council and the Auditor's certification of funds; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to amend the previous ordinance at the earliest possible date in order to allow the services to continue without interruption; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That Section 1 of ordinance 1644-2022 is hereby amended with additional language underlined and deletions marked as stricken, which shall hereby read as follows:\n \nThat the Public Safety Director is hereby authorized to modify the contract with ShotSpotter, Inc. to extend the term for a period of  one year 36 months for a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis system and to provide the capability of the system to be integrated with existing City technology infrastructure in order to adequately capture, layer, and share data across technology platforms.\n \nSECTION 2. That existing Section 1 of ordinance 1644-2022 is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
