The contract amount is $931,079.25, with a contingency of $193,920.75, for a total of $1,125,000.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,127,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nEach year, the Recreation and Parks Department allocates a portion of the Capital Improvements Budget for the improvement of existing hard surfaces and new installations of hard surfaces. This particular contract focuses on the improvement of asphalt and concrete surfaces that are highly used by the public and includes entry drives, parking lots, trails, sidewalks, and sport courts.  By improving these surfaces, safe and easy access can be ensured to the parks and facilities. Areas for improvement were initially considered through recommendations from internal staff and public involvement. All requests were assessed through a Pavement Condition Rating (PCR) form and were given a rating from 0, meaning the worst condition, to 100, meaning the best condition. All requests were prioritized for action based on their respective PCR scores. From there, staff confirmed which projects to move forward with. \n \nThe Hard Surface Improvements 2021-2022 Project includes the following locations:\n \nBerliner Park\nAnheuser Busch Park\nCooper Park\nKilbourne Run Park\nRhodes Park\nSammons Park\nMcFerson Commons Park\nFar East Park\nTuttle Park\nMillbrook Park\nWestgate Park\nMoeller Park\nVarious Sites (Parking Lot Catch Basins)\nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on June 1, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on June 22, 2022.

Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nM&D Blacktop (MAJ): $723,690.25 (Base bid, prior to alternates and contingency being added)\nCAP STONE and Associates Inc. (WBE): $1,039,995.30\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that M&D Blacktop was the lowest and most responsive bidder. M&D Blacktop and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nPavement Protectors DBA M&D Blacktop\n2020 Longwood Avenue, Grove City, OH, 431123 \nMark Nance; (614) 875-9989\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004731, 31-1131599\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: February 1, 2023                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as there is a limited window for temperature and weather appropriate construction of hard surface improvements prior to the end of 2022. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project aims to provide accessible and usable asphalt, concrete, and sport court improvements throughout our park properties.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Needed improvements were identified by both internal staff and from community requests.
