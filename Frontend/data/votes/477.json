    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into an agreement with OARnet /OSU, a local non-profit educational institute (servicing grades K-12, colleges, and universities) for continued fiber network and broadband access and related services. The original agreement was authorized by ordinance 0789-2007, which was passed on June 4, 2007. It was most recently authorized on June 25, 2018 with passage of ordinance 1681-2018. \n \nWith authorization of this agreement, OARnet will provide the City with upgraded internet service for one year, from March 2021 through February 2022, at a cost of $81,600.00. Included in this price is high-speed internet service and a 10-Gigabit port connection at the East and West Data Centers.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes paying OARnet $18,400.00 for provision of internet service from July 2020 through February 2021. Purchase orders PO020166 and PO0131261 originally established for the above-noted past service, were canceled in error, and thus, payment has yet to be made for it. \n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the total expenditure of $100,000.00 for the above-described services. The expenditure will be made from the 2021 operating budget, pending passage of ordinance number 2503-2020. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe $81,600.00 for service from March 2021 through February 2022 is budgeted and available in the 2021-operating budget. The balance of $18,400.00, for payment for past service, is not expressly budgeted in the 2021 budget. However, the department anticipates that these costs can be absorbed without issue during the course of the 2021 fiscal year.\n \nNOT-FOR-PROFIT CONTRACT INFORMATION\nThis agreement is being awarded under City Code section 329.30, which prescribes the method for contracting with not-for-profit organizations. DoT and OarNet negotiated the cost for provision of the above-described services, the costs for which are outlined in the attachment to this ordinance entitled “0558-2021 Quote-OARnet.” The services being authorized herein include upgraded internet service and continued broadband access which must be provided by an outside agency. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor: OARnet/OSU\nCC#/F.I.D#: 31-6025986-105 (Non-Profit Organization) Expiration: NPO\nDAX Vendor Acct. #: 005303\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into an agreement with OARnet/OSU for continued and upgraded internet access pursuant to City Code relating to not-for-profit organizations; and to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.
