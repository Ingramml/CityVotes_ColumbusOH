    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize and Celebrate Box 15 on their 75th Year of Serving the Columbus Division of Fire, Central Ohio Fire Departments, and Communities in the City of Columbus.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, on an early Sunday morning, March 30, 1947, with the temperature in the upper 20’s with 25-30 mph winds and heavy snowfall, Columbus firefighters were on the scene of a 3-alarm blaze at the Fruehauf trailer facility on Fletcher Street. Less than 24 hours later, they fought a 4-alarm fire at the Ohio Furniture Co. on E. Main Street. Max Haverman, a long-time fire buff, was at both incidents; and\n \nWHEREAS, following that second major fire, Max approached Fire Chief Clarence Ogburn with the idea that the firefighters could really use some relief from the elements. He mentioned that there were other groups that helped the firefighters, the closest of which was Box 21 in Dayton; and\n \nWHEREAS, Max, a pharmacist with the Wendt-Bristol Co. worked just a block away from Fire Station #3 (at S. 3rd. St. & Capital Alley) and was friends with most of the firefighters at the downtown stations. Chief Ogburn was receptive to the idea and gave Max the go-ahead to come up with a plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, three months later, on Tuesday, June 24, Max and 14 other people met at Columbus Fire Station #4 (then located at Russell & Hamlet Streets) for the first time and decided to form up as a group. The initial intent was to “support Columbus Fire and Columbus Police in every way possible.” They named it Box 15 - “Box” referring to the (then) common fire alarm boxes located on nearly every street corner of the city, and “15” referring to the number of people in the initial group; and\n \nWHEREAS, initially, Box 15 members were asked to help haul hose, move obstructions, run errands, or do anything useful in addition to providing sandwiches and hot/cold beverages. In 1950 Box 15 expanded its scope and offered to respond to major incidents throughout Franklin County. Later Box 15 response area would include Delaware and parts of Fairfield County; and\n \nWHEREAS, today Box 15 is a non-profit 501C3 group with 24 active volunteers that respond to emergency incidents, training events, or civic events to support firefighters, police officers or other first responders 24/7/365. The organization follows National Fire Protection Association 1584 which is the standard for Rehabilitation Process for firefighters during Emergency operations and Training Exercises; and\n \nWHEREAS, Box 15 provides tools such as tents, misting fans, heaters, and climate-controlled vehicles to shelter fire fighters in rehab from the elements. Box 15 concentrates efforts on hydration, nutrition, core temperature stabilization by providing water, Gatorade, cold towels, coffee, and nutrients to firefighters. 8 years ago, Box 15 started providing skin wipes, and shower equipment, for firefighters to use as a \"gross decon” to help remove carcinogens, from skin and gear; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate the 75 years that Box 15 has served Columbus firefighters following a simple mission statement. “Box 15 is dedicated to providing Canteen and Firefighter Rehab Services, and to support, as best we can, in every practical way, the work of our first line of defense against the ravages of fire - the men and women of the fire service.”",
