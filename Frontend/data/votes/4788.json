The original contract totaled $84,616.81 and was procured through the State of Ohio’s Microsoft Contracts and Enrollments Large Solution Providers (LSPs) contract, 0A1252 (expiring on 6/30/2025). This Ordinance authorizes the modifying of the above-mentioned contract by adding 60 hours to the original 330 hours for a total of up to 390 hours of both pro-active and reactive Microsoft support.\n \nDell’s Microsoft premier support bid includes account management, support assistance and problem resolution services. The continued provision of these services will help keep the various Microsoft tools and applications, used throughout the city, operating smoothly. These services were originally procured through solicitation of bids via the State of Ohio’s Microsoft Contracts and Enrollments Large Solution Providers (LSPs) contract, 0A1252. Four responses to the original solicitation were received, including that from Dell, which was deemed the lowest responsive submission. The other respondents were as follows:\n \nDell Technologies - $84,616.81\nMicrosoft - $85,740.00\nSHI - $86,597.40\nSoftchoice - $89,740.00\n \nDell wishes to continue to provide these services and to modify the original contract by adding 60 hours at a cost of $15,435.12. The term of the original contract is not being extended. As such, the term of this contract, as modified, ends on December 16, 2022.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $15,435.12 for the above-described services. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Dell Marketing, LP.; FID/CC#: 74-2616805; Expiration Date: 08/30/2023; (DAX Vendor Account # 010030)\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this expenditure are available and budgeted in the Information Services 2021 operating fund budget.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is being requested for this ordinance so that the services described above are available before expiration of the contract being modified.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify an existing contract with Dell Marketing, LP; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to establish a purchase order with Dell Marketing, LP, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to add funds to the above-noted contract; to authorize the expenditure of $15,435.12 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund, and to declare an emergency.
