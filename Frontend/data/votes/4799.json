The contract amount is $86,978.24, with a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $96,978.24 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nEach year, the Recreation and Parks Department allocates a portion of the Capital Improvements Budget to the improvement of existing hard surfaces and new installations of hard surfaces. This particular contract focuses on the removal and replacement of existing asphalt and concrete surfaces that are highly used by the public, including entry drives, parking lots, and walkways.  By improving these surfaces, safe and easy access can be ensured to the parks and facilities. Areas for improvement were initially considered through recommendations from internal staff and public involvement. All requests were assessed through a Pavement Condition Rating (PCR) form and were given a rating from 0, meaning the worst condition, to 100, meaning the best condition. All requests were prioritized for action based on their respective PCR scores and based on feedback from relevant stakeholders. From there, staff confirmed which projects to move forward with.  \n \nThis contract will provide engineering services to assess existing hard surface conditions, design improvements for the hard surfaces, and create complete construction documents for bidding in early 2023. The Department is anticipating spending around $1,000,000.00 on hard surface improvements construction in 2023.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised to three pre-qualified engineering firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 1, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on July 21, 2022.  Request for proposals were sent to the following companies:\n \nCESO Inc. (MAJ)\nDLZ Inc. (MBE)\nGPD Group (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended GPD Group be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nGPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210\nKevin Grathwol, 614-210-0751, gpd@gpdgroup.com\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006560, 34-1134715\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 20, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that GPD Group can begin engineering services immediately so that final construction documents are ready for bidding by March 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project aims to provide accessible and usable asphalt, concrete, and sport court improvements throughout our park properties.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Needed improvements were identified by both internal staff and from community requests.
