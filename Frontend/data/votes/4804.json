    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a service contract with Sensus USA, Inc. for the Enhanced Meter Project.  This is a joint project between the Division of Water and the Division of Power.  Funds in the amount of $2,000.00 have been encumbered for prevailing wage services to the Department of Public Service.\n \nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities with the supply and installation of power meters, the installation of city issued water meters, the supply and installation of all communications infrastructure, and all software required to operate an Enhanced Meter System to interface with the City of Columbus systems and applications.  The Division of Water (DOW) and the Division of Power (DOP) will be funding this project through various funding sources.  The solution will allow both DOW and DOP to collect meter readings and provide enhanced services for DOW’s approximately 300,000 customers/accounts and DOP’s approximately 16,000 customers/accounts.\n \nThe original ordinance (1024-2020) also authorized the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a long term Spectrum Lease Agreement in order to operate Sensus's FlexNet equipment. The Spectrum that Sensus is leasing is authorized by Sensus’s FCC License(s) and is limited to the service area where the FlexNet equipment will be operated. The frequencies of the FCC License within the City’s geographic Service Area are called the “Leased Spectrum” and the City will pay fees to Sensus for the use of the Leased Spectrum.\n \nThe first modification ordinance (0223-2021) increased the funding by $2,303,586.03 as was planned in the original proposal.  The funds were for the purchase and installation of electricity meters, related components and other required services. The second modification is necessitated by an increase in customer growth causing an increase in demand for meters and a dip in standing inventory. This modification of $500,000.00 will allow for the inventory of meters to be returned to an adequate level for the completion of this project.\n \nPlanning area:  \"99 - Citywide\" (Entire service area including suburbs) \n \nThe Water Portion of this project has been approved for below market rate loan financing through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) which is administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  Loan No. 8884 was awarded April 30, 2020.  Federal Davis Bacon Wage Rates and Requirements apply.\n \nTHE PROJECT TIMELINE: The original term of this Contract was for 1,500 calendar days after the date of the Notice to Proceed in accordance with the approved schedule included in the Statement of Work. This contract modification will modify the terms of the contract to allow the City to permit schedule adjustments via change order in the future.  The contract is expected to be completed in less than 5 years however this may change in the future if a change order is presented and approved by the DOW.\n \nBID INFORMATION:  The selection of the firm providing the services was performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Columbus City Code, Section 329.28.  The evaluation criteria included:  1. Understanding of Project, 2. Environmental Considerations, 3. Past Performance, 4. Local Workforce, in addition to 5. Warranty, and 6.
