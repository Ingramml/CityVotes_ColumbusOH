    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into an agreement with Woolpert Inc. to provide the Department of Public Utilities, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Mapping Section with digital ortho-imagery services with a contract with the State of Ohio CSP#0A1177. The contract is part of the Ohio Statewide Imagery Program (OSIP). The contract, which is administered through OGRIP (Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program) and an office under the Ohio Department of Administrative Services, was competitively bid. A cooperative purchase agreement based upon a large area collection throughout the entire state of Ohio provides a substantial scale of economy pricing schedule. Also, as part of the bidding process, OSIP requires a high level standard of quality, deliverables and delivery time frames, which the state of Ohio enforces. The consistent performance of collection and deliverables is frequently measured by the state.\n \nOrdinance 582-87 authorizes the City of Columbus to participate in cooperative purchasing contracts.  Given the proposed time frame and complexity of the project, it is in the City's best interest to take advantage of the State of Ohio contract to secure these services.\n \nThe intent of this project is to acquire new service area-wide color ortho-imagery data to update the GIS database. This project will leverage the existing contract with the Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program, State of Ohio, for Statewide Imagery Program (OSIP) with Woolpert, Inc.  Because the existing color ortho-imagery data is out of date, the demand for current data is high.  This project supports stormwater and watershed management and provides higher accuracy in calculating impervious area for the stormwater utility billing system. Additionally, the imagery supports the efficient use of technology to support ongoing operational needs within the entire Department of Public Utilities.\n \nThe Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program (OGRIP) continues to sponsor programs to better support the users of geospatial data within Ohio, and the Ohio Statewide Imagery Program (OSIP) is one program that accomplishes this goal.  As a governmental subdivision of the State of Ohio, the City of Columbus can be party to this contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  Woolpert, Inc.
