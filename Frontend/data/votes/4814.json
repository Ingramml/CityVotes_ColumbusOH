    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a second contract with Central Community House, Inc. to complete the pilot Transit Arts Residency Program (TARP). The initial legislation was approved on 7/12/21 by ordinance 1800-2021 and the contract under PO293492 that expired on June 1, 2022. This legislation will extend the contract to June 30, 2023. The program employs youth and mentor artists to create art projects based on community needs and desires. Youth participating in the pilot program are predominantly from the areas served by Central Community House on the near east and near south side and Gladden House in Franklinton. \n \nMaster artists engage with young and youth artists, mentoring and guiding them as they brainstorm and create group art projects. Experts in graphic design, architecture, metalworking, among other specialties work with the TARP participants as their expertise is needed, expanding the horizons of both participants and volunteers. Mental wellness sessions are also available to program participants. A portion of the has been allocated toward the design and construction of a performance venue and training space, as well as improvements to the 1251 Bryden Road property, the home of Transit Arts.\n \nThe full $700,000.00 was paid to Central Community House for the TARP program upon contract execution. There is currently approximately $252,299.00 remaining. COVID-19 and its variants affected and continue to affect TARP staff, participants and their families, delaying art projects and facility construction. A new contract is requested so that the TARP can complete its programming and property improvements. It is expected that the projects will be completed and the funds will be spent by the end of the year. However, because of the unpredictability of COVID-19 and supply chain issues, it is requested that the new contract term expire on June 30, 2023. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  None\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor’s contract compliance number is CC-006068 and expires on 03/22/2024. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a second contract with Central Community House, Inc., to authorize a time extension to June 30, 2023 to complete the pilot Transit Arts Residency Program (TARP), and to permit reimbursement of costs incurred during the gap period between agreements starting June 1, 2022.
