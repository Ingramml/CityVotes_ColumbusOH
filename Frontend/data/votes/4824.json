    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation in an amount up to $143,597.84 for annual Accela software license subscriptions and maintenance as well as system customizations that will enable plan review and processing capabilities and fully integrate with the Department of Building and Zoning’s Accela functions.  \n \nThe Department of Development’s Planning Division provides staff support to eight historic district and design review commissions.  These commissions have approval authority over any development within their boundaries that require a building permit.  Upon approval from the given commission, the given property owner or developer is issued a “Certification of Appropriateness” (COA) for their development project, which allows the property owner or developer to pursue their building permit with Building and Zoning Services.  The process of securing a COA inherently includes overlapping processes with Building and Zoning Services.  The implementation of the Accela program for the Planning Division will result in an online and more synchronized process for securing building permits in historic districts and design review areas.  This synchronization will result in higher levels of transparency, alignment, and efficiencies for customers, the community, and given commission.    \n \nThis ordinance also waives the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes. The Department of Development wants to ensure seamless integration with Building and Zoning Services, Department of Public Service, and Department of Public Utilities’ Accela platforms.  This is best achieved by obtaining the licenses and, more importantly, the customization work through Carahsoft.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Neighborhood Economic Development fund (2237).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The contract compliance number for Carahsoft Technology Corporation is 009115 and expires on 07/26/2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation for software licenses, maintenance, and application customizations; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $143,597.84 from the Neighborhood Economic Development fund. ($143,597.84)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development’s Planning Division provides staff support to eight historic district and design review commissions.  These commissions have approval authority over any development within their boundaries that require a building permit; and\n \nWHEREAS, the implementation of the Accela program for the Planning Division will result in an online and more synchronized process for securing building permits in historic districts and design review areas.  This synchronization will result in higher levels of transparency, alignment, and efficiencies for customers, the community, and given commission; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the city that the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code be waived; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operations of the Department of Development to authorize the Director to enter into contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation Inc. for annual software license subscriptions and maintenance as well as system customizations that will enable plan review and processing capabilities and fully integrate with the Department of Building and Zoning’s Accela functions; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation Inc. for annual software license subscriptions and maintenance as well as system customizations that will enable plan review and processing capabilities and fully integrate with the Department of Building and Zoning’s Accela functions. \n \nSECTION 2.
