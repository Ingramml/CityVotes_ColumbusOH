    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT), to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract (UTC)/Purchase Agreement (PA) for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing.\n \nMicrosoft Office is the city’s technology standard for desktop computing software, currently used by approximately 7,500 city employees in their daily business.  The city also utilizes Microsoft software to support a number of enterprise applications. This ordinance will enable the city to obtain the latest versions of Microsoft software utilizing a single agreement for the entire city.\n \nOn October 25th, 2020, the Department of Finance’s Purchasing Office published, RFQ016877 to solicit quotes for a new three-year Microsoft Enterprise Agreement UTC/PA. The five submissions received in response to the solicitation were: Crayon Software Experts; Dell Marketing, LP; Insight Public Sector; SHI International; and Softchoice.  A three-person evaluation committee determined that the submission of Dell Marketing, LP was the most responsible, responsive and best offer. As such, the Purchasing Office recommended that the UTC/PA be awarded to Dell Marketing, LP for a term of three years, expiring on December 31, 2023. (See attached Award Recommendation letter).\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the appropriation of $1,983,513.89 from the unappropriated balance of the Special Income Tax fund to cover the cost of the above-described license. Two million dollars has been allocated in the Special Income Tax Fund for this acquisition. The balance of $3,714.20 comes from the Information Services fund and is attributable to the Department of Public Utilities.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $1,987,228.09 for the above-described purchase, for a term of one year, starting on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2023. Of this total, $1,805,934.17 is for the annual renewal of the license and $181,293.92 is for the 2022 “true-up.” \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance appropriates $1,983,513.89 in Special Income Tax funds to DoT to fund a portion of the annual Microsoft Enterprise Agreement and “true-up” costs. The balance of $3,714.20 is budgeted and available in the Information Services Operating Fund, direct charge allocation, attributable to the Department of Public Utilities.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nDell Marketing LP, CC#74-2616805, expires 8/30/2023\nDAX #010030\n \nTitle\nTo appropriate $1,983,513.89 within the Special Income Tax Fund; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Universal Term Contract/ Purchase Agreement for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing; to authorize the expenditure of $1,983,513.89 from the Special Income Tax Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of $3,714.20 from the Information Services Operating Fund.
