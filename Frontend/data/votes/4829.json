    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance amends previously approved ordinance 2216-2022 by modifying the funding source and associated agreements.\n \nOrdinance 2216-2022, authorized the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into grant agreements with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Ohio Women’s Alliance, both 501(c)(3) not for profit corporations, in support of ensuring Access to Reproductive Healthcare. These funds will be used to provide practical support and medically accurate and legal reproductive health information to residents of the City of Columbus. “Access to Reproductive Healthcare,” as used in this ordinance, includes patient support expenses that arise in the pursuit of reproductive healthcare, such as transportation, lodging, childcare, and lost wages; information hotlines, peer support, and case management; community education and engagement regarding reproductive health; and operational needs of the grantees stemming from providing such supports to the public. “Access to Reproductive Healthcare” does not include the use of public funds to subsidize abortion procedures and associated services such as anesthesia, laboratory tests, or hospital services. \n \nThrough the American Rescue Plan, this legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into subaward not for profit services contracts with Ohio Women's Alliance and Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio in an amount up to $500,000.00 each to add needed reproductive health support services for residents of the City of Columbus. This legislation also authorizes the expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 for these services within the Department of Finance and Management's allocation in the Recovery Fund 2209. Importantly, all expenses must be eligible under the United States Treasury American Rescue Plan guidelines. Expenses must be necessary expenditures incurred and related to disproportunately impacted populations due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n \nThese contracts shall be awarded pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.30: Process for awarding not-for-profit service contracts estimated to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). The services contemplated under these subaward contracts cannot be provided by existing City employees as the City lacks the necessary personnel.\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is required to administer this change. This ordinance replaces general fund dollars with State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund proceeds.\n \nEmergency action is requested to amend the original ordinance as soon as possible so that the related contracts and programs can be administered promptly.\n \nTitle\nTo amend ordinance 2216-2022 by modifying the funding source for the related contracts; and to declare an emergency.
