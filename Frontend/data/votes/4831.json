    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a design and construction agreement with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) for the administration of the Bicentennial Park Scioto Mile Fountain Improvements Project. The City’s cost share for this project is $7,500,000.00 and this contribution is being authorized by this ordinance. The estimate for the project is $15,000,000.00.  The City and CDDC will each fund 50% of the project.  \n \nSimilar to how the fountain was originally built, as authorized by Ordinance 1746-2007, it has been determined that it will be beneficial to have the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation perform the administration of this project as it will allow for better coordination with other significant downtown projects. The City recognizes the benefit that the Bicentennial Park Scioto Mile Fountain Improvements Project will have on its citizens by continuing to provide an important downtown Scioto Riverfront attraction available without admission to the families of the community. Therefore, it is in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code.\n \nWhen the Bicentennial Park Scioto Mile Fountain originally opened July 2011, it provided an iconic civic asset along the riverfront and an integrated water feature that CNN ranked as one of the country’s best. Like all good things, it is time for an update and an upgrade. For more than 12 years, the Bicentennial Park Scioto Mile Fountain has been a key part of summer in our community and has been well loved by people of all ages. Our goal is to keep it that way. This is the right time to not only make improvements to the functionality but take the experience to a whole new level. Downtown is everybody’s neighborhood and the Scioto Mile is a huge part of how we deliver that promise. We’re investing in this world-class asset not only so it can be continue to be enjoyed by families for many years to come but it will also expand equity and inclusion elements in the core of our city. To that end, CDDC is partnering with world-class design professionals at AECOM and WET Design, to create an incredible fountain-centered experience for our entire community. The design will continue to feature three iconic steel halos and the signature blooms feature to create a variety of experiences, including enhancements to halo fog and super shooters, jets that can shoot water 100 feet into the air, and added visual and interactive appeal, including a system that will engage and interact with visitors. A sprite area will be added that will be especially programmed for the youngest visitors. Increased seating, shaded areas, and space for food trucks and carts offering reprieve and refreshment to Downtown visitors will be provided. Sculptural light elements with vibrant, constantly changing colors will delight visitors with dynamic light shows in the cold-weather season to make the Scioto Mile Fountain a year-round destination.  \n \nTo accomplish all of this in the top-tier fashion that the community has come to expect from this iconic asset, the City of Columbus and CDDC will partner to fund this project. The budget is $15,000,000.00 to complete the design, construction and commission of the project. The project will be shared in a 50/50 partnership. CDDC will leverage the Scioto Mile Endowment, created by CDDC when the Scioto Mile was first constructed, to provide the remaining $7,500,000.00 needed after the City’s $7,500,000.00 contribution. This is reflective of the initial Scioto Mile partnership, where the public sector and private sector split the costs for design and construction equally. Design is ongoing and construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2023. The plan is currently to reopen the fountain for Memorial Day 2024. Bicentennial Park is part of a group of parks along the riverfront that make up the Scioto Mile that will be enjoyed by citizens and visitors for generations to come. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nColumbus Downtown Development Corporation\n150 South Front Street, Suite 210\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nGreg Davies, CEO, 614-545-4700\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 010217, 76-0704655\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: June 8, 2024\n \nBenefits to the Public: The project will provide a new, more reliable, and interactive fountain, along with additional seating capacity and shade within the park, for people to enjoy the fountain.
