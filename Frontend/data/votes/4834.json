    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the contract with Righter Company, Inc. for specialty maintenance crafts services (FEM Project No. 0101.6). This renewal No. 3 is to add additional funding for repairs at various Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) and Division of Power (DOP) facilities.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code (RFQ013910). Two Hundred and Ninety-Five (295) vendors were solicited and one (1) bid from Righter Company, Inc. was received and opened on November 6, 2019. The bid from Righter Company, Inc. was awarded as the lowest, responsive, responsible and best bid received. \n \nThe original contract was for a period of one year with three (3) one-year renewal options on an annual basis and contingent upon mutual agreement, availability of funding and Columbus City Council approval. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that require additional funding, a modification will be requested. This renewal is for the final year of a four (4) year contract and will extend the contract through and including January 21, 2024.\n \nThe work under this contract includes repair, modification, and/or replacement of substations or other DPU facility components and auxiliary equipment at DOSD’s wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), Compost Facility, and Sewer Maintenance Operations Center (SMOC), and at various DOP facilities. \n \nThe contract renewal will continue to provide specialty maintenance crafts services for DOSD and DOP facilities. Anticipated DOSD work includes Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant asphalt repairs, corrections of items noted on annual safety reports, Sewer Maintenance Operations Center (SMOC) flooring replacement, process piping painting, overhead door maintenance and repair, parking lot sealing and striping, and general WWTP exterior concrete tank repairs. Anticipated DOP work includes additional light pole foundation repairs, substation roof and door repairs, and electrical vault repairs and grating replacement. \n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds: Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal No. 3 is $950,000.00 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and $250,000.00 for the Division of Power, for a total contract renewal amount of $1,200,000.00.

This renewal is to provide the necessary funding for services provided through January 2024.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.                     How cost was determined: The cost, terms and conditions to provide specialty maintenance crafts services for DPU facility equipment and components are in accordance with the original contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nRighter Company, Inc. | EIN 31-0889208 | D365 Vendor #004433 | Expires November 22, 2023\nRighter Company, Inc. does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$1,200,000.00 is budgeted and needed for this contract renewal.\n \nLabor:                                           $625,000.00 (DOSD), $150,000.00 (DOP)\nMaterials:                     $325,000.00 (DOSD), $100,000.00 (DOP)\nTotal:                                          $1,200,000.00                     \n \nDivision of Sewerage & Drainage\n$801,923.26 has been spent in 2022\n$776,176.38 was spent in 2021 \n$353,836.61 was spent in 2020\n \nDivision of Power\n$115,824.02 has been spent in 2022\n$163,205.99 was spent in 2021 \n$75,510.49 was spent in 2020\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned renewal of the specialty maintenance crafts services contract with Righter Company, Inc. for the Department of Public Utilities; and to authorize the expenditure of $950,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund and $250,000.00 from the Power Operating Fund.
