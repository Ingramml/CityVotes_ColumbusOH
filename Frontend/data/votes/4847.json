    "description": "Title\n \nTo declare October 2022 as Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the City of Columbus, and to recognize The Ohio State University for their advocacy and efforts to raise awareness regarding breast cancer in Columbus and Central Ohio.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, each year more than 230,000 American women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States. It is estimated that 287,850 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women in 2022 alone, with 51,400 new cases of non-invasive breast cancer; and\n \nWHEREAS, the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age.  About 80% of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year are ages 45 or older, and about 43% are ages 65 or above; and\n \nWHEREAS, about 5-10% of breast cancers can be linked to known gene mutations inherited from one’s mother or father. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most common. On average, women with a BRCA1 mutation have up to a 72% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. For women with a BRCA2 mutation, the risk is 69%. Breast cancer that is positive for the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations tends to develop more often in younger women. An increased ovarian cancer risk is also associated with these genetic mutations. In men, BRCA2 mutations are associated with a lifetime breast cancer risk of about 6.8%; BRCA1 mutations are a less frequent cause of breast cancer in men; and\n \nWHEREAS, as of January 2022, there are more than 3.8 million women with a history of breast cancer in the U.S. This includes women currently being treated and women who have finished treatment; and\n \nWHEREAS, breast cancer is a more curable disease than it was 30 years ago due to increased awareness, improved treatment options, as well as  improved mammography screenings, which helps detect breast cancer early; and \n \nWHEREAS, there have been numerous studies which have shown that early detection saves lives and increases the options for treatment; and\n \nWHEREAS, One in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and although it’s the second most diagnosed cancer in women behind skin cancer, the five-year survival rate is more than 90 percent for breast cancers detected early thanks to enhanced screening and prevention methods. There are more than 3.1 million breast cancer survivors living in the U.S. today; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize the importance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and salutes The Ohio State University for their continuous work to raise awareness regarding breast cancer in Columbus, Central Ohio, and throughout the globe.",
