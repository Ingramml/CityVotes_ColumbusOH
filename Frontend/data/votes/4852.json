    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and celebrate the Columbus Division of Fire’s 200th Anniversary of serving the residents and businesses of Columbus, Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Columbus Division of Fire, formerly known as the Columbus Fire Department, was created on February 21, 1822 in response to an eight-building fire that occurred earlier that year; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original volunteer force included a 15-man hook and axe company, a 12-man ladder company, and a 12-man company responsible for guarding property. The department’s first fire engine was a hand-pump model that allowed firefighters to be more effective at extinguishing fires than using bucket brigades; and\n \nWHEREAS, over the Division of Fire’s 200 years, there were many technicalogical advances. From a gong and bell system, to street box fire alarms (where Box 15, a volunteer support organization that celebrated 75 years in 2022, got its name), to today’s complex smoke detector and sprinkler systems; and\n \nWHEREAS, the EMS unit is an invaluable branch of the Division of Fire, which its runs represented 79% of division calls as of 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, another important improvement has been the self-contained breathing apparatueses on firefighters’ backs and improvements in the gear that is worn by firefighters. According to the National Insititute for Occupational Health and Safety, firefighters have a 9% higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer and a 14 % higher risk of dying from cancer than the general US population; and\n \nWHEREAS, today, Columbus has 35 fire stations and a Division strong of about 1,600 members and firefighters. The Division’s mission is as strong today as it was on day one: “Our mission as the Columbus Division of Fire is to serve our community by preventing emergencies through education and inspection. Minimizing injury, death, and property destruction due to fire, natural disaster and other emergencies while providing timely and effective emergency medical services;” now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate the 200 years of service and duty shown by firefighters in the Columbus Division of Fire; thank every firefighter and EMS professional who has served and protected the residents, homes, and businesses of Columbus, Ohio; and encourage residents to visit the Central Ohio Fire Museum & Learning Center to learn more about our history.",
