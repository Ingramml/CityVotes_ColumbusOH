    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department (the \"Department\") to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Wagenbrenner Development, DBA Thrive Companies, (the \"Developer\") and Franklinton Apartments I QOZB, LLC (the \"Owner\") and to formally accept and dedicate from the Owner a 1.7 acre parkland parcel at 854 West Town Street in Franklinton as part of the Mount Carmel West development, as required by City Code Chapter 3318. In addition, this ordinance will authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to grant a temporary construction access easement and enter into a park construction and maintenance agreement with the Developer.\n \nSince 2019, the former Mount Carmel West Hospital Campus in Franklinton has been in planning to redevelop the area into a mixed use neighborhood of residential, commercial, and office spaces. During the rezoning process, the Department has been working with the Developer to establish highly needed public park space in Franklinton.  As a result of these discussions, the Department and the Developer have agreed to the terms of an MOU that will require the Owner to donate a 1.7 acre parcel of land to the City to be dedicated as public parkland. Upon completion of construction of other buildings in this direst vicinity by the Developer, the Developer has also agreed to build a new park on the donated parkland and to maintain the park improvements in perpetuity.   \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Commission approved the terms of the MOU and authorized the Director to accept the land donation at its September 14, 2022 meeting.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nWagenbrenner Development Inc. DBA Thrive Companies\n842 North 4th Street, Suite 200\nColumbus, Ohio  43215\nMark Wagenbrenner, (614) 545-9247\n \nFranklinton Apartments I QOZB, LLC \n842 N. Forth St. Ste 200\nColumbus, OH 43215\n                       \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to authorize the Director to enter into the MOU and grant the temporary construction easement so as not to delay the Developer's construction schedule which is set to begin by November 2022.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: Franklinton is the City's most underserved community for parks and active recreation. Providing small neighborhood-scale recreation spaces will improve community health and wellness through outdoor play, walking, social interaction, and a sense of neighborhood pride.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During 2020, public engagement with the Franklinton Community was done to review conceptual designs of the park. The project was also reviewed by the area commission and the Recreation and Parks Department, approving the 1.7 acre park design and noting its key location in a neighborhood that has no park space.\n   \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by supporting partnerships as well as providing quality parks, paths, and connectivity for Columbus residents.  \n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Wagenbrenner Development, DBA Thrive Companies and Franklinton Apartments I QOZB, LLC; to authorize the Director to formally accept and dedicate a 1.7 acre parkland parcel at 854 West Town Street in Franklinton as part of the Mount Carmel West development; to authorize the Director to grant a temporary construction access easement and a park construction and maintenance agreement to Wagenbrenner Development, DBA Thrive Companies; and to declare an emergency.
