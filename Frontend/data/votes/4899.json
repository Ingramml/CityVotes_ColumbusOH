Ransom on the occasion of his retirement from The Ransom Company\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, The Ransom Company was founded in the late 1890’s by Benjamin Ransom, as a coal & ice delivery service by way of horse and buggy. In the 1940’s, the coal business was passed down to his son, Lewis, along with his wife Martha and their children. Together, the family worked to diversified services during that tenure. \n \nWHEREAS, Elyot L.
