    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to enter into an agreement with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. (CGI), for PragmaCAD software maintenance and support services, for a one-year term, beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2023, at a cost of $65,159.00. The PragmaCAD system, which is the mobile dispatching system for the Department of Public Utilities, interfaces with the current work order system and helps DPU optimize service order assignments and capture field information for immediate use. \n \nCGI is the sole provider of the PragmaCAD source code and the Banner interface. No other party is authorized to install, modify, maintain or support this proprietary code. As such, this ordinance is submitted in accordance with the Sole Source provisions of the City of Columbus Code, Chapter 329.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to modify and extend existing agreements with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. through the extension of purchase orders PO231970 and PO336928. There are no additional funds associated with these extensions. Rather the extensions ensure access to the balance of funds on both aforementioned purchase orders through December 31, 2023 and are necessary due to project delays (attributable primarily to the Covid pandemic). Purchase order PO231970 was originally authorized by Ordinance 1164-2020, which passed on June 15, 2020. This purchase order was subsequently extended by Ordinance 2130-2021, which passed on November 1, 2021. Purchase order PO336928 was established following passage of Ordinance 1466-2022, which passed on June 13, 2022.\n \nAll parties involved with this project (DPU, DoT and CGI) have agreed to pursue the extending purchase orders PO231970 and PO336928 through December 31, 2023.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for software maintenance and support services are available and budgeted in the Information Services Operating Fund. No additional funds are required for the extension of the abovementioned purchase orders.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nCGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc.\nCC#/F.I/D. #: 54-0856778; Expires: 07/15/2023\nVendor Acct. #: 009176\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities, to enter into a contract with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. for PragmaCAD software maintenance and support services in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities, to modify and extend existing agreements with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc. through the extension of purchase orders PO231970 and PO336928; and to authorize the expenditure of $65,159.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund.
