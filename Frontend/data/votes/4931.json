    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Human Service Chamber Foundation (HSCF) in an amount up to $300,000.00 to provide funding in support of an expansion of existing services provided to the central Ohio nonprofit sector and to allow for payment of expenses starting October 1, 2022.\n \nThe HSCF, a nonprofit organization, currently provides support services to nonprofits in central Ohio. In the summer of 2022 a Shared Services Committee of the Human Services Chamber (HSC) was convened to identify the greatest need for specific professional services. The findings of the committee identified that the top professional services needed in the nonprofit sector that could be provided under a shared services model were human resources, communications and marketing, accounting and finance, development, IT, data management, and legal services. There was universal interest in such services, but near-universal acknowledgment that the agencies lacked the capacity or resources to integrate such efforts into their operations.\n \nFurthermore, a “sustainability survey” conducted with Smart Columbus in the summer of 2021, was done in order to identify the interest in providing professional services or resources specific to helping health and human services nonprofits mitigate against the accelerating effects of global warming, both for their clients as well as for their own agencies. \n \nThis Shared Services approach will create unprecedented efficiencies and cost-savings while improving the business operations of the nonprofit sector.  As such, HSC seeks to expand and improve upon its current roster of professional services and resources. By hosting, administering, and facilitating these services, HSC can create equitable access to human resources, PR and communications, legal services, sustainability efforts, accounting services, development, and more for nonprofits of all sizes and service areas across the city. The cost-savings and capacity-saving will allow agencies to have greater resources and capacity to invest in addressing the most pressing needs of the people of our community, now and well into the future.\n \nThe Human Service Chamber of Franklin County will offer the following through a Shared Services approach: Human Resources, Communications/Marketing, Sustainability and Global Warming Preparedness for the nonprofit sector in Columbus. Additional services may be added in the future.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Department of Development Division of Administration 2022 General Fund Budget.  Funds will be transferred from Object Class 03 to Object Class 05.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 028003 and expires 9/7/2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Auditor’s Office to transfer funds within the General Fund in the Department of Development, Division of Administration; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Human Service Chamber Foundation in an amount up to $300,000.00 to provide funding in support of an expansion of existing services provided to the central Ohio nonprofit sector and to allow for payment of expenses starting October 1, 2022; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $300,000.00 from the General Fund.
