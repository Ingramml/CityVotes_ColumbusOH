    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Greater Columbus Arts Council (GCAC) in an amount up to $250,000.00 for the creation of a Columbus Public Art Master Plan. \n \nThe purpose of the Public Art Master Plan will be to set a vision and develop a clear set of community-informed goals, policies and objectives to provide guidance for GCAC, the City of Columbus, the Columbus Art Commission, and other community stakeholders regarding the development, improvement, and enhancement of public art and cultural arts programs in the community. This Plan will cast a bold vision to catalyze the creation of more public art in public spaces in Columbus, and serve as a tool to guide the community in arts planning for the short-term (5-year) and long-term (10-year) basis. This process will include a comprehensive inventory of public art, robust and equitable community engagement, an analysis of current and forecasted needs and recommendations for implementation strategies. This will be the first public art master plan for the city of Columbus, Ohio. \n \nGreater Columbus Arts Council (GCAC) will administer the project funding. GCAC works to support and advance the arts and cultural fabric of Columbus. GCAC funds artists and arts organizations and provides marketing services for local artists and organizations.
