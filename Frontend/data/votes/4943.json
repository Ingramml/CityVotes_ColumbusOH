Const., Inc.                                          $3,758,516.88\n3.                     Shelly & Sands, Inc.                                          $4,264,558.20\n4.                     George J. Igel & Co., Inc.                              $4,483,604.58\n \n3.1 PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS: The Ruhlin Co. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \nRuhlin Co.’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $3,283,895.58.  Their Contract Compliance Number is 34-0640780 (expires 9/3/24, Majority) and their DAX Vendor Account No. is 17759.  Additional information regarding all bidders, description of work, contract time frame and detailed amounts can be found on the attached Information form.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against The Ruhlin Co.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM:  This contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 27% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 27% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency designation is requested so that the embankment repair can be completed before the spring rains that cause high river levels which may interfere with the construction and cause additional erosion.  This, in turn, would result in increased costs to the City.\n \n6. FISCAL IMPACT:  A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Voted Bonds Fund - Fund No. 6006 will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with The Ruhlin Co. for the Lockbourne Road Quarry Embankment Improvements Project; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $3,285,895.58 within the Water General Obligation Voted Bonds Fund; to provide for payment of prevailing wage services to the Department of Public Service; for the Division of Water; to authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; and to declare an emergency.  ($3,285,895.58)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, four (4) bids for the Lockbourne Road Quarry Embankment Improvements Project were received and publicly opened in the offices of the Director of Public Utilities on September 21, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid was from The Ruhlin Co. in the amount of $3,283,895.58; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to award and execute a construction contract for the Lockbourne Road Quarry Embankment Improvements Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to encumber and expend funds to provide for payment of prevailing wage services associated with said project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a transfer and expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
