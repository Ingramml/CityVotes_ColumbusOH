The objective of the engagement is to quantify the costs and benefits, where possible, to calculate an expected return on investment, for both the County and the City, separately.\nA waiver of competitive bidding is requested because Stout Risius Ross, LLC has a proven track record working with municipalities across the country on the study and analysis of tenants facing an eviction.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that Stout can immediately begin providing analysis at eviction court on behalf of Columbus residents facing eviction.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds are available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund to support this contract.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Stout Risius Ross, LLC in an amount up to $100,000.00 in support of a cost-benefit analysis study for tenants facing eviction in the City of Columbus; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
