    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND AND BID INFORMATION:\nThis legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to issue purchase orders to Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Sutphen Corporation, and Stryker Sales Corporation for the purchase of Fire and EMS emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment.\nCompetitive bidding is being waived for each of the below vendors.  City agencies are required to obtain at least three actual quotes from STS vendors; the Fire Division is not able to do so with Atlantic Emergency Solutions and Sutphen Corporations, given the lack of available manufacturers of custom fire apparatus within the State of Ohio's STS schedule. Given the Division of Fire's need for custom apparatus, referencing a contract awarded through this program with three quotes is not possible, thus the submission of this bid waiver legislation to City Council.  This custom apparatus from Pierce and Sutphen has been the Fire Division's standardized equipment for several years, as Fire believes these products are the best for their operations given the quality, durability and customizability each manufacturer offers, as well as the cost effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with each manufacturer during the build process.  By dealing directly with each manufacturer during the specification and price negotiation processes, Fire is able to control costs to remain within budgeted funding, and manage lead times.  The subsequent contracts established by Fleet Management with each manufacturer has also simplified the managing of parts/service after purchase.\n \nCompetitive bidding is being waived for Stryker Sales Corporation as the Stryker Power Cot is the standardized ambulance cot deployed by Columbus Fire, making it manifestly impractical to bid given Stryker is the sole distributor for their proprietary equipment.\n \nAtlantic Emergency Solutions  ~  FID #273187193  /  Vendor 034448  ~  The Division of Fire is in need to purchase one (1) Pierce Tandem Axel 107' ladder in the amount of $1,983,538.00; included in the quote for this purchase is the cost for three (3) inspection trips for eight (8) CFD personnel totaling $33,000.00 (pre-construction, post paint, and final).  This purchase is made in accordance with State of Ohio Index #STS618, Schedule #800918, which expires 6/30/2023, however bidding requirements for STS purchases cannot be fulfilled for this custom apparatus given the lack of available suppliers, thus a waiver of bidding is necessary.\nSutphen Corporation ~ FID #310671786  /  Vendor 004200  ~  The Division of Fire is in need to purchase two (2) Sutphen Corporation Monarch Custom Pumpers in the amount of $1,726,368.00 to replace apparatus that are beyond their useful life with high maintenance costs; included with the Sutphen Monarch Custom Pumpers purchase will be the purchase/installation of all pertinent equipment to be utilized on the respective vehicles.  This purchase is made in accordance with State of Ohio Index #STS618, Schedule #800814, which expires 8/31/2024, however bidding requirements for STS purchases cannot be fulfilled for this custom apparatus given the lack of available suppliers, thus a waiver of bidding is necessary.\nStryker Sales Corporation ~ FID #382902424 / Vendor 030281 ~ The Fire Division is in need to purchase seven (7) Stryker Ambulance Power Cots for each of the EMS Transport vehicles being ordered from Horton Emergency Vehicles.  While in the past these cots have been included in the specifications along with other EMS equipment that comes included on the vehicle, it has been discovered that buying directly from the manufacturer will result in a significant savings to the City.  A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code, Chapter 329 is necessary for this purchase as the Stryker Power Cot is the standardized ambulance cot deployed by Columbus Fire, making it manifestly impractical to bid given Stryker is the sole distributor for their proprietary equipment.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Current build times (900 calendar days for aerial ladders and 24 months for engines) for the fire apparatus purchased in this ordinance require emergency action to insure funds are encumbered immediately to allow for the production of these custom apparatus to commence upon passage of this ordinance and confirmation of the subsequent purchase orders.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  Cash is available upon transfer from various projects within the Safety Voted Bond Fund for this purchase; these transfers are a temporary funding method, and will be refunded when the City sells notes or bonds to fund the current Capital Improvement Budget. \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $4,118,758.72 within various projects of the Safety Voted Bond Fund; to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into contracts with and issue purchase orders to Atlantic Emergency Solutions for the purchase of one (1) ladder in the amount of $1,983,538.00, Sutphen Corporation for the purchase of two (2) Monarch Custom Pumpers in the amount of $1,726,368.00, and Stryker Sales Corporation for the purchase of seven (7) Stryker Ambulance Power Cots; to authorize the expenditure of $4,159,152.91 from the Safety Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($4,159,152.91)\nBody\nWHEREAS, a need exists within the Fire Division to purchase front line response rescue and fire apparatus and related equipment; and,\nWHEREAS, a transfer of funds within the Safety Voted Bond Fund is necessary to fund this purchase; and,\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2021 Capital Improvement Budget; and,\nWHEREAS, the City will sell notes or bonds to fund the current Capital Improvement Budget and will reimburse the various projects within the Safety Voted Bond Fund; and,\nWHEREAS, this transfer should be considered as a temporary funding method; and,\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to issue purchase orders to Atlantic Emergency Solutions, Sutphen Corporation, and Stryker Sales Corporation, for the purchase of emergency response apparatus/vehicles and related equipment needed by the Division of Fire; and,\nWHEREAS, a waiver to the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes is necessary as per the attachment to this ordinance; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to make these purchases and transfer said funds from within the Safety Voted Bond Fund as a temporary funding measure to purchase said equipment, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
