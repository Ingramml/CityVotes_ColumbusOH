    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with EDGE Group to provide professional services associated with the detailed design of three median parks in the West Franklinton Neighborhood as part of the West Franklinton Parks Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $157,520.00.\n \nOrdinance 0073-2021 authorized the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with EDGE Group to perform preliminary design of three median parks in the West Franklinton Neighborhood. This design work entailed conceptual designs for the three medians, public meetings, surveys, coordination with other city departments, and selection of amenities for Phase 1 of park development. This ordinance is a planned modification of that contract to perform final design and bid documents for the Phase 1 improvements.  The improvements include new play spaces, courts, small shelters, neighborhood gathering spaces, and signage. The project will also improve access and safety at these locations. \n \nLocated just west of downtown, Franklinton has become a diverse cross section of neighborhoods from the arts district along the eastern edge, to the redeveloping West Broad Street corridor, to the dense single family housing in the western side of the area. The West Franklinton Community predominantly encompasses neighborhoods west of State Route 315 to Interstate 70 and from Interstate 670 to Mound Street on the south edge. Like many older built-out communities, providing quality greenspace, recreation, and accessibility presents a significant challenge for the long-term health and well-being of the community. Three of West Franklinton’s largest public spaces are the wide medians of Dakota Avenue, West Park Avenue, and Guilford Avenue. These are the spaces that will be improved.  The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Land Plan shows that West Franklinton is the most underserved community in the City for parks and recreation facilities per capita. A mere 10.8 acres of parkland exists in an inner city community of over 9,000 residents. To address some of this need, this project will design selected recreation improvements for the medians. These areas comprise almost 6.5 acres of public greenspace.  Over 6,000 residents live adjacent to or within a few minutes’ walk from these three sites. \n \nSince 2017, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has been collaborating with the City’s Department of Development and engaging with the Franklinton Community on the potential of activating these greenspaces as small neighborhood parks with potential amenities such as walking paths, gathering spaces, and play spaces. In 2019, the Franklinton Area Commission endorsed this project to move forward with Urban Infrastructure Recovery Funds (UIRF) for design and construction.  In 2022, an additional $400,000 in funding was approved through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program to support future construction. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEDGE Group, Inc.\n330 West Spring Street, Suite 350\nColumbus, Ohio 43215 \nTedd Hardesty, (614) 486-3343\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 001500, 20-8054208\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: April 28, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so the detailed plans can be completed, allowing construction to be bid and the project completed by the end of 2023 in order to meet the timeliness requirements of the CDBG funding that will support the construction phase of this project. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Franklinton is one of the city's most underserved communities for parks and active recreation. Providing small neighborhood-scale recreation spaces will improve community health and wellness. This is achieved through outdoor play, walking, social interaction, and a sense of neighborhood pride.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Extensive public input was gathered throughout 2017 and 2018 through direct engagement at public meetings and person-to-person exchanges at the Franklinton Library. A survey was also conducted and playgrounds, trees, open active space, walking paths, benches, and shelters were listed as the top park priorities. The project was discussed with the Franklinton Area Commission and Franklinton Board of Trade in 2018, 2020 and 2021. Also, a public open house was held on May 5, 2022 to discuss the project. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks and paths while offering easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $87,436.00 was legislated for the Cultural Arts Center Parking Lot and Site Improvements Project by Ordinance 0073-2021. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $157,520.00. $157,520.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $244,956.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with EDGE Group for the West Franklinton Parks Improvements Project; to authorize the expenditure of $157,520.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
