    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Decker Construction Company for the Turnberry Golf Course Improvements Construction Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $175,000.00.\n \nThe Turnberry Golf Course, bordering Blacklick Creek, is an Arthur Hills designed links style championship course. This course hosts many local youth tournaments, provides learning opportunities for all ages, and is open to the public. This project will be addressing some of the badly deteriorated cart paths on the course as well as improved drainage in areas that will make the course more usable for our customers. Revenues generated through greens fees, cart rentals, tournaments, and permitted rentals support the operation of the golf courses. These improvements to the golf course will encourage increased use and revenue for the department.\n \nBy modifying this contract, Decker Construction Company will be able to finish the repairs to the cart path and finish the drainage improvement associated with said improvements. The original contract underestimated the areas of deterioration from the time the project was designed to the time it was actually built. The needs for these funds were not anticipated at the time of initial award and, therefore, the areas of repair exceeded what was originally anticipated.  It is not recommended to award this work through another procurement process since unit prices have already been established with Decker Construction Company and they are already mobilized on site. The costs for the additional repairs were determined for using existing unit prices that were already established by the original contract multiplied by verified field measurements.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDecker Construction Company\n3040 McKinley Avenue \nColumbus, Ohio 43204                                                      \nJonathan R. Apple, 614-488-7958                                                   \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004549, 31-0983557\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: December 2, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as construction work is currently underway and this will allow the contractor to perform the necessary additional work while already on site so that the course can return to a normal state of operation. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Improving drainage to reduce standing water and improving the circulation of cart paths for ease of player use will provide a better experience at this course, encouraging increased use of the course. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: This site hosts various tournaments and golfers demand that the playing surfaces be in satisfactory condition, especially when competing in tournaments.\n \nArea(s) Affected: South East (65)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by improving revenue producing amenities. Additionally, this project will help maximize the use of existing recreational facilities for enhanced programming and offerings. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $493,100.00 was legislated for the Turnberry Golf Course Improvements Construction Project by Ordinance 0165-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $175,000.00. $175,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $668,100.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Decker Construction Company for the Turnberry Golf Course Improvements Construction Project; to authorize the transfer of $175,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $175,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
