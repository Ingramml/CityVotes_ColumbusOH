($750,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Advanced Metering System (AMS) Study and Implementation Project, Division of Water Contract No. 2073.\n \nUnder Original Contract No. EL017444, the Department of Public Utilities contracted with EMA, Inc. to assist in Phase 1 of the contract which was to develop and recommend a strategy, roadmap, and implementation plan of an Advanced Metering System (AMS) for water and electric meters. Under this phase, EMA, Inc. evaluated state-of-the-art AMS technologies; evaluated and compared cost impacts; developed a detailed implementation schedule; and assisted the City in budgetary planning efforts.\n \nModification No. 1 occurred in May 2017 to procure Phase 2 Services, which included preparation of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an AMS system that clearly defined the City’s objectives and requirements.  \n \nModification No. 2 occurred in June 2019 to provide Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services, which included coordination of the AMS System vendor selection process, assisting the City in negotiating the technical requirements of the project so a final scope and cost could be determined for the project solution, and program management assistance. \n \nModification No. 3 occurred in October 2021 to provide continued Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services.  This included coordination of AMS business process development, program management assistance during the implementation of the project, and coordinating the system installation, system interface development and testing plans.\n \nModification No. 4 (current) is a planned modification to continue providing Phase 4 Services. These services include continued program management assistance during implementation from Proof of Concept through mass meter installations, introduction to the customer portal, vendor management, area management, continued public outreach communications, installations inspections, and reporting. \n \nFuture modifications were anticipated and expected as outlined in Ordinance No's 1597-2015, 0797-2017, 1847-2019, and 2572-2021.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $750,000.00\nOriginal agreement:                     $369,077.71  (EL017444)\nModification No. 1:                     $550,000.00  (PO065223)\nModification No. 2:                     $750,000.00  (PO218378)\nModification No. 3:                     $750,000.00  (PO304311)\nModification No. 4 (current):                     $750,000.00\nTotal to Date:                     $3,169,077.71\n \n 1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:   \nThis is a planned modification as indicated in the original authorizing legislation, Ordinance No. 1597-2015, as well as the following modifications under Ordinance No’s 0797-2017, 1847-2019, and 2572-2021.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nModifications to the agreement were planned as part of the original Request for Proposals RFP.  Additionally, the current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the work to-date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will further delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost proposal was provided by EMA, Inc.  The proposal was reviewed by Department staff and deemed acceptable.\n \n2.0 FUTURE CONTRACT MODIFICATION(S):  Due to the volume of meter installations this phase is projected to last the remainder of the project and will need annual funding through the project completion, which is estimated to be January 2027.\n \nThe planning area is “99 - N/A” as this project serves multiple planning areas.\n \n3.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nAn AMS program is favorable to the DPU’s operations and customer service functions, as replacing older water and electrical meters will improve service, decrease burden on maintenance operations, reduce water loss, and improve revenue.  Moving from quarterly to monthly billing will have a positive impact on customers as the bills will be more manageable in both cost and time.\n \n4.0 CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  41-1467091; expires 10/7/23, Majority. DAX Vendor No. is 007843.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against EMA, Inc.\n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  There is sufficient cash and budgetary authority for this project within the Water G.O. Bond Fund - Fund No. 6006. \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned modification of the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Advanced Metering System Project; for the Division of Water; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $750,000.00 from the Water General Obligations Bond Fund.  ($750,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, contract No. EL017444 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1597-2015, passed July 20, 2015, was executed on August 21, 2015, and approved by the City Attorney on September 2, 2015, for the Advanced Metering System Study and Implementation Project; and\n \nWHEREAS, modification No. 1 under Contract No. PO065223 was authorized by Ordinance No. 0797-2017, passed May 1, 2017, was executed on June 2, 2017, approved by the City Attorney on June 6, 2017, and established funding for Phase 2, preparing a Request for Proposal (RFP); and\n \nWHEREAS, modification No. 2 under Contract No. PO218378 was authorized by Ordinance No. 1847-2019, passed July 29, 2019, was executed on March 10, 2020, approved by the City Attorney on March 12, 2020, and established funding for Phase 3 and Phase 4 Services, which include continued coordination of the AMS System vendor selection process and program management assistance during the implementation of the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, modification No. 3 under Contract No. PO304311 was authorized by Ordinance No. 2572-2021, passed November 1, 2021, was executed on December 10, 2021, approved by the City Attorney on December 17, 2021, established funding for Phase 3 and Phase 4 services which include continued coordination of AMS business process development and program management assistance during the implementation of the project; and \n \nWHEREAS, modification No. 4 (current) a planned modification to continue providing Phase 4 Services, which include: continued program management assistance during implementation from Proof of Concept through mass meter installations, introduction to the customer portal, vendor management, area management, continued public outreach communications, installations inspections, and reporting; and\n \nWHEREAS, due to the volume of meter installations, future modifications are anticipated through project completion, estimated to be January 2027; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional services agreement with EMA, Inc. for the Advanced Metering System Study and Implementation Project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds within the Water G.O.
