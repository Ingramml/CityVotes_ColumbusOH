    "description": "Explanation\nThe Civil Service Commission needs to increase the maximum authorized expenditure in the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to add funds for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police and Fire Academy classes. Funding is typically added annually or prior to each academy class.  As part of our 2022 budget development, Finance advised us they were purposefully under-funding entry-level safety medical screenings but would monitor expenses as the year progressed and identify additional funds as determined necessary.  The original academy classes identified for 2022 were two (2) Police Officer classes of 35 each (total of 70), and two (2) Firefighter classes of 35 each (total of 70).  As the year progressed it was determined by Public Safety that there would need to be (3) Police Officer classes totaling 170 recruits, one (1) “lateral” class of (50) out-of-jurisdiction Police Officer recruits, and three Firefighter classes totaling 135 recruits. So, knowing the original 140 medical assessments needed were under-funded to begin with, and then accommodating the increase in classes/recruits requiring a total of approximately 450 additional medical assessments to cover upcoming Police and Fire classes beginning in December and first quarter of 2023, it becomes quickly evident how our original budget appropriation was grossly under-funded and a significant increase in funding is now required.\n \nSince this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process (see below), the contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes.  Pricing for the additional assessments is in accordance with bid pricing previously submitted by Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for 2022/23 services.\n \nBid Information: In 2019, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFP 013916) for these services and accepted proposals through December 13, 2019. Four proposals were submitted by the deadline. An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP and the Executive Director selected and executed a contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. (Ordinance 0440-2020).\n \nEmergency designation: Emergency legislation is requested in order to allow sufficient time for the Department of Public Safety to continue to schedule police and fire candidates for upcoming recruit classes.\n \nContract Compliance Number: CC005227, expires 10/4/2023. \n \n                     \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify, by increasing, the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; to authorize the expenditure of $280,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($280,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the contract to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. based upon the submissions of RFP 013916; and\n \nWHEREAS, for 2022, One Hundred and Fifty Thousand dollars ($150,000.00) have been authorized to Mount Carmel Health Providers for the pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits services; and\n \nWHEREAS it is now necessary to increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes; and,\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to modify, by increasing, the contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes, and thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare; now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to modify, by increasing, the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the purpose of administering pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress tests to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $280,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
