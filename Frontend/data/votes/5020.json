    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance is to authorize the City Auditor to establish an auditor’s certificate in the amount of $450,000.00 for various expenditures for professional architectural, engineering, and construction management services in conjunction with park, trail, and facility capital improvement projects. This ordinance will also waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329, authorizing the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into contracts on behalf of the City for the professional services mentioned herein so long as total expenditures under any contract do not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). Ordinance 2453-2018 authorized a similar arrangement of pre-qualified vendors for the period of 2018 to 2020 and Ordinance 2050-2020 authorized a similar arrangement of pre-qualified vendors for the period of 2020 to 2022. The 2018 to 2020 pilot arrangement was a success and was continued for the 2020 to 2022 period, creating efficiencies for many projects during this time. Therefore, this ordinance will renew this pre-qualified arrangement for the period of 2022 to 2024. \n \nThis legislation will authorize the establishment of an auditor certificate for the future award of contracts for Architectural, Engineering, and Construction Management Services. Contracts will be awarded to Consultants that have been pre-qualified in accordance with Columbus City Code Sections 329.26 and 329.27. Services that will be provided may include, but are not limited to:\n \n● Architectural Design, Structural Engineering\n● Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC Engineering\n● Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Structural Engineering\n● Construction Management and Inspection \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department solicited Requests for Statements of Qualifications for Professional Architectural and Engineering Services as well as for Professional Construction Management Services. Multiple contracts will be awarded to various companies that were deemed to be prequalified through the evaluation process. The RFSQ’s were advertised through the City’s Vendor Services website on April 29, 2022 and received on May 27, 2022. The City received 14 responses for Architectural Design and Structural Engineering, 8 responses for Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and HVAC Engineering, 21 responses for Civil, Environmental, and Structural Engineering, and 15 responses for Construction Management and Inspection. In accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommends that the firms identified be selected to perform the work.  The firms were chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project understanding. After a review by the Selection Committee, the following companies were deemed prequalified through 2024:\nArchitecture and Engineering:\nAEC (MBE)\nBBCO (MBE)\nCompass (MBE)\nCT Consultants (MAJ)\nDesign Group (MAJ)\nDLZ (MBE)\nEDG (MAJ)\nEL Robinson (MAJ)\nFishbeck (MAJ)\nGPD Group (MAJ)\nKorda (MAJ)\nKramer Engineering (MAJ)\nLatus Studios (MAJ)\nM+A Architects                      (MAJ)\nOA Spencer (MBE)\nOHM (MAJ)\nPrime AE (MAJ)\nResource International (MBE)\nStone Environmental (MBE)\nStrand (MAJ)\n \nConstruction Management and Inspection:\nAsner (MAJ)\nAscension Construction Services (MBE)\nCTL Engineering (MBE)\nDynotec (MBE)\nMS Consultants (MAJ)\nRoberts (MAJ)\nSmoot Construction (MBE)\n \nAs was done per 2453-2018 and 2050-2020 for the previous two year arrangements and per City Code Section 329.15, regarding non-emergency waiver of regulations, it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code for the purpose of this ordinance. Authorizing the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contracts up to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), raising the threshold from twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) noted in Section 329.24, will continue to create significant efficiencies within the Recreation and Parks Department moving forward. The Department has many recurring, non-project specific needs for Professional Service contracts in excess of $20,000.00 that are essential to the ongoing operation of the Department’s strategic planning, design, and construction management functions. Instead of drafting new legislation to approve all contracts over twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00), all contracts anticipated as a result of this ordinance will be able to move forward as soon as they are needed, as a result of this ordinance. \n \nFurthermore, the process used by the Recreation and Parks Department to prequalify the vendors noted herein provided a significant amount of competition among potential vendors. The process used to select the prequalified vendors was in accordance with City Code Sections 329.26 and 329.27. These sections are the standard process used to select and authorize professional services contracts over fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). This ordinance will allow the Recreation and Parks Department to use the results of this completed process to collect technical proposals from the prequalified vendors as each new need arises. In turn, there will be sufficient competition for all contracts authorized by this ordinance. All relevant city codes, in regards to selecting vendors for professional services have been met. All contracts will be entered into in accordance with the prequalification process described herein this ordinance and in\ncompliance with the procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 regarding professional services.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Having this funding in place for needs as they arise will benefit the community by helping to ensure that parks, trails, and facilities remain accessible, safe, updated, and user friendly.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community input has not been obtained on this legislation because it is being used mainly for staff augmentation needs, as well as, emergency and unanticipated needs. However, community input will be sought as appropriate for work that results from contracts awarded through this auditor certificate.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This arrangement will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to ensure that parks, trails, and facilities remain accessible, safe, updated, and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: $450,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Bond Fund 7702 and 7712 to meet the financial obligations of these various expenditures. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish an auditor’s certificate in the amount of $450,000.00 for various expenditures for professional architectural, engineering, and construction management services in conjunction with park, trail, and facility capital improvement projects; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into multiple future professional service contracts; to authorize the transfer of $450,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; and to authorize the expenditure of $450,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
