    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to pay Delaware County for sewer service provision during fiscal year 2022 according to an agreement entered into by the City of Columbus and Delaware County in 1991, authorized by Ordinance 2424-91. This agreement authorizes discharge of sewage from Delaware County into the sewer system of the City of Columbus and from the City of Columbus sewer system into the Delaware County sewer system in order to avoid duplication of wastewater treatment. A copy of the original agreement and a 2018 amendment and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are attached to this legislation.
