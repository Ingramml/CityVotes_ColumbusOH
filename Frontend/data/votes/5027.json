    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish a Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to purchase defibrillators and related consumable supplies with Zoll Medical Corporation.  The Division of Fire is the sole user of defibrillators.  The Fire Division needs to purchase these medical devices and supplies for use in daily emergency services and emergency medical service (EMS) operations.  The term of the proposed option contract would be approximately two (2) years, expiring December 31, 2024, with the option to renew for one (1) additional year.  In addition, the expenditure of $1.00 is hereby authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002025.  \n \nBid Information:  This purchase is recommended to be made with a waiver of formal bidding requirements, as Zoll Medical Corporation is offering special pricing that exceeds the savings offered in their current State Term Pricing; a bid waiver would also result in a more expedient process to replace existing aging defibrillators currently in use by the Division of Fire.  This ordinance also authorizes the waiver of the surplus property requirements of the City Code, as Zoll's pricing reflects the trade in of existing equipment that is nearing the end of it's useful life cycle.\n \nZoll Medical Corporation, CC# 000197 expires 9/24/2024, All Item, $1.00\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to make funding immediately available to acquire this important equipment, and ensure EMS response services can continue without interruption.\n                      \nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Parties listing of the Federal Government and are not listed in the Auditor of States database for Findings for Recovery.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The expenditure of $1.00 is hereby authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002025.  City Agencies will be required to obtain approval to expend from their own appropriations for their estimated annual expenditures.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract for the option to purchase defibrillators and related consumable supplies with Zoll Medical Corporation; to authorize the expenditure of $1.00; to waive the provisions of competitive bidding; and to declare an emergency. ($1.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need to purchase Zoll Medical Corporation defibrillators for the Division of Fire; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Fire recommends that it is in the City's best interest to waive the competitive bidding procedures of City Code Chapter 329 to allow the purchase from Zoll Medical Corporation in order to take advantage of special pricing that exceeds the savings offered in Zoll's State Term Pricing; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Fire recommends that it is in the City's best interest to waive the the surplus property requirements of the City Code, as Zoll's pricing reflects the trade in of existing equipment that is nearing the end of it's useful life cycle; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, to ensure that proper safety equipment is available to medics providing additional life saving measures in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately enter into a Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase Defibrillators and related consumable supplies, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to enter into the following contract for the option to purchase defibrillators and related consumable supplies for a term of approximately two (2) years, expiring December 31, 2024, with the option to renew for one (1) additional year, as follows:\n \nZoll Medical, All Items, $1.00\n \nSECTION 2.
