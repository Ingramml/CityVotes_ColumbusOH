    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: The Council of the City of Columbus, Ohio (the “Council”) passed Ordinance 1993-2019 on July 22, 2019 authorizing the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) to enter into an Economic Development Agreement by and between the City, North Market Development Authority, Inc. (“NMDA”), and NM Developer LLC (the “Developer”), dated September 11, 2019, as modified by the letters dated August 9, 2021 and September 20, 2022 from the City to the Developer (as so modified, the “EDA”), concerning the development of a 31-story, mixed-use building on the surface parking lot adjacent to the existing public market owned by the City (the “North Market”) and together located on Franklin County Tax ID Parcel Nos. 010-054645 and 010-307276 (collectively, the “Site”). The mixed-use development will include an expansion of the North Market, a new public atrium, a new shared community plaza (the “Shared Plaza”), structured parking, office, residential units, and a hotel (collectively, the “Project”). The Developer has agreed to provide 20% of the residential units as workforce housing on the condition that the City provide financial assistance, which pursuant to Ordinance 3215-2021 passed July 25, 2022, the City will fund using a portion of the hotel/motel/short-term rental excise taxes that are generated by the hotel located within the Project (the “North Market Hotel Bed Taxes”). Additionally, the City committed to using the remaining North Market Hotel Bed Taxes to provide funding to NMDA for the maintenance of the North Market and the cultural enrichment it provides to the community. Within the EDA, the City, NMDA, and the Developer also committed to establishing a new community authority in relation to the Project on a portion of the Site not including the existing North Market (the “NM Mixed-Use Project NCA”). The purposes of the NM Mixed-Use Project NCA include, but are not limited to, receiving a remaining portion of the North Market Hotel Bed Taxes at the expiration of the workforce housing term as well as providing an additional annual payment to NMDA all for capital maintenance of the North Market, and also managing the Shared Plaza. On or about October 28, 2022, a petition for the organization of the NM Mixed-Use Project NCA (the “Petition”) was filed with the Clerk of Council by the City, as the statutory developer under Section 349.01(E) of the Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”), with the written consent of the Developer. By this resolution, Council approves and authorizes the Director, for and in the name of the City, signing and filing the Petition, and Council, as the organizational board of commissioners described and required by R.C. Chapter 349, will determine the sufficiency of the Petition, authorize public notices, and set a public hearing date on the Petition. Furthermore by this resolution, Council authorizes the Director, or his or her authorized designee, to hold the required hearing and to forthwith certify to Council that the hearing was held as advertised.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to timely provide notice in a newspaper for three consecutive weeks prior to a public hearing and set the public hearing date within 30-45 days of the date after the Petition was filed in accordance with R.C. Chapter 349.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo approve and authorize the Director of the Department of Development, for and in the name of the City, signing and filing the petition to establish the NM Mixed-Use Project New Community Authority; to determine that the petition to establish the NM Mixed-Use Project New Community Authority is sufficient and complies with the requirements of Chapter 349 of the Ohio Revised Code; to authorize the appropriate City officials to hold a public hearing on the petition at the time and place set herein; to authorize the notice of such public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county for three consecutive weeks; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Council of the City of Columbus, Ohio (the “Council”) passed Ordinance 1993-2019 on July 22, 2019 authorizing the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) to enter into an Economic Development Agreement dated September 11, 2019, as modified by the letters dated August 9, 2021 and September 20, 2022 from the City to the Developer, (as so modified, the “EDA”) by and between the City, North Market Development Authority, Inc.
