($2,628.29)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND:\nThis legislation authorizes payment for design services by DLZ Ohio, Inc. for revised pavement design for the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project based on observations in the field during construction to keep the City within current design standards in an amount up to $2,628.29.\n \nThe Department of Public Service is engaged in the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project.  This project consists of the installation of approximately 3,900 feet of sidewalk along Deshler Avenue between 18th Street and Lockbourne Road and approximately 1,600 feet of sidewalk along Kossuth Street between Carpenter Street and Linwood Avenue.  Sidewalk will be installed along one side of both streets.\n \nOrdinance 2919-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with DLZ Ohio, Inc., in an amount up to $200,000.00 for the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South contract, a part of the Operation Safewalks - CelebrateOne Sidewalk project.  Ordinance 3236-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the professional services contract with DLZ Ohio, Inc., to add additional funds for project.\nOrdinance 2187-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with G&G Concrete Construction, LLC for the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South (Deshler from 18th Street to Lockbourne Avenue) and Operation Sidewalks - Celebrate1 Sidewalk - Near South (Kossuth - Carpenter to Linwood) projects and to provide payment for construction, construction administration and inspection services.  \n \nThe construction contract (PO291515) for this project is near completion resulting in the closure of the design contracts (PO101853 and PO150589) with DLZ Ohio, Inc. with the expectation that design services had been completed and were no longer needed.  Late in the construction phase of the project, inspection staff realized the new curb at two intersections would be well outside the standard max slope once the typical pavement replacement was completed at those locations. This would result in a fairly big dip for a car between the pavement replacement and the existing pavement. DLZ Ohio, Inc. figured out a solution resulting in site visits, meetings, and hours for the design. DLZ Ohio, Inc. provided revised pavement design for both intersections based on field observations to keep the City within current design standards and avoiding any abrupt pavement transitions for drivers.  \n \nDLZ Ohio, Inc. made adjustments to the construction plans after the closure of the design phase of the project.  It is now necessary to legislate in order to make payment to DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the work performed as it relates to the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds for this project are available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bonds Fund, Fund 7704.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \n3.  COMPLIANCE NUMBER:\nThe contract compliance number for DLZ Ohio, Inc., is CC004939 and expires 12/3/22.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of this program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to pay design costs to DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,628.29 for utility relocations for this project from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  ($2,628.29)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is engaged in the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project; and \n \nWHEREAS, the project consists of the installation of approximately 3,900 feet of sidewalk along Deshler Avenue between 18th Street and Lockbourne Road and approximately 1,600 feet of sidewalk along Kossuth Street between Carpenter Street and Linwood Avenue; sidewalk will be installed along one side of both streets; and\n \nWHEREAS, the design contracts (PO101853 and PO150589) for this project were closed too early necessitating the need for legislation to create a PO in order to make the final payment to DLZ Ohio, Inc. for design services rendered; and \n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to expend $2,628.29, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay the final design invoice on the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project; and\n \nWHEREAS, this expenditure is to pay for design services from contracts put in place prior to the implementation of the City’s Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program and as such is not a part of the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service to pay design costs to DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the CelebrateOne Sidewalk - Near South project; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
