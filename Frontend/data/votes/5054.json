    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for approximately $1 billion in discretionary grant funding for FY 2022 through the new Safe Streets for All (SS4A) grant program. This is the first round of funding for the RAISE grant program.  The final NOFO was released on August 1, 2022 and remained open through September 15, 2022.\n \nThe purpose of SS4A grants is to improve roadway safety by significantly reducing or eliminating roadway fatalities and serious injuries through safety action plan development and implementation focused on all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation users, motorists, personal conveyance and micromobility users, and commercial vehicle operators. The program provides funding to develop the tools to help strengthen a community’s approach to roadway safety and save lives and is designed to meet the needs of diverse local, Tribal, and regional communities that differ dramatically in size, location, and experience administering Federal funding.  There are two types of grants: Action Plan Grants (for comprehensive safety action plans) and Implementation Grants.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit a SS4A Implementation Grant application because the City’s Vision Zero Action Plan is a comprehensive safety action plan.  As part of its Livingston Avenue Improvements Study, the Department of Public Service is currently working with community members and other stakeholders to understand safety concerns along the corridor and develop a plan to promote safety for all roadway users and reduce vehicle speeds and severe crashes.  The Department is requesting $12 million in SS4A funding from USDOT, and it anticipates this will provide approximately 50% of the funding for implementing safety improvements for the Livingston Avenue corridor between 18th Street and Nelson Road.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally apply for a SS4A Implementation Grant.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USDOT or others in connection with the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nRAISE grants may be used for up to eighty percent (80%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Program Implementation Grant from the United States Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Transportation and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced the first round of funding for the Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Grant Program, which is a RAISE grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDOT accepted applications for the FY 2022 funding round through September 15, 2022; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City is working with community members and other stakeholders to develop safety improvements for the Livingston Avenue corridor, from 18th Street to Nelson Road; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service to authorize the Director to apply for and accept the grant funding; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from USDOT’s SS4A program for the Livingston Avenue corridor between 18th Street and Nelson Road; to accept said grants, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 3.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period by law.",
