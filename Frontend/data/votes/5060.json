    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes a contract between the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods and the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity, a 501(c)(3), in an amount of up to $200,000.00 for purposes of conducting a 16-month comprehensive post pandemic assessment and impact study related to the needs of boys and young men of color.\nThe Kirwan Institute will assist the city through a comprehensive assessment of the needs of boys and young men of color for the purpose of identifying post pandemic opportunity areas and impact study of current programming for the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) program. The assessment will provide demographic information, a vulnerability index and mapping, mapping of community assets, and definition of areas of focus, including education, mentoring and workforce development, violence prevention, and trauma intervention.  This study will inform future policy and programming aimed at improving the quality of life and access to opportunity for boys and young men of color in Columbus.\nMy Brother’s Keeper is an initiative launched under the administration of President Obama and is intended to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through MBK, cities, towns, businesses, and foundations take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class.\nThe Kirwan Institute is a national leader in diagnosing structural conditions that drive inequity as well as at identifying strategic intervention points for advocacy and policy. The Institute has regularly worked as partner and advisory consultant to social justice organizations and community groups across the nation. This includes spearheading a significant number of projects, research and collaboration efforts to promote community organizing, community development, fair housing, and social justice through our “Opportunity Communities” program and “Community of Opportunity” framework.\nEmergency action is requested in order to expedite the completion of the post pandemic assessment and impact study in order to implement the recommendations contained therein.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is available in the Department of Neighborhoods general operating budget, Fund 1000.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a 16-month contract with the Kirwan Institute for the completion of a community assessment and impact report for the My Brother’s Keeper initiative; to authorize the expenditure of $200,000.00, and to declare an emergency. ($200,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, there remain persistent opportunity gaps for boys and young men of color in the areas of education, mentorship, and networks of support that would allow them to reach their full potential; and\nWHEREAS, the My Brother’s Keeper initiative seeks to address those gaps by bringing together public and private partners in cooperation to create those opportunities for boys and young men of color to attain the skills they need for jobs or higher education; and\nWHEREAS, the Kirwan Institute is a national leader in identifying both conditions that lead to inequality and intervention points and actions to reduce that disparity; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily business of the Department of Neighborhoods in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a 16-month contract with the Kirwan Institute for the expedited completion of the assessment and the more immediate implementation of the recommendations contained therein, for the preservation of the public health, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
