    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management on behalf of the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Thermo Electron North American LLC for the purchase of one (1) ThermoFisher Scientific Integrion Reagent Free Ion Chromatography System (includes complete installation and training) to be used at the Division of Water Quality Assurance Laboratory (WQAL).  ThermoFisher Scientific Integrion Reagent Free Ion Chromatography System will be used by the WQAL for simultaneous analysis of anions and cations in drinking water and source water to protect public health.\nAnions and cations include fluoride, chloride, sulfate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and bromide.  The chloride to sulfate ratio impacts the corrosive nature of the water and impacts our compliance with the Lead and Copper Rule.  Monitoring bromide in the source water is important since bromide is converted to bromate by ozone during treatment.  In addition, bromide is incorporated into the disinfection byproducts (trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids) during drinking water disinfection.  Both bromate and the disinfection byproducts are regulated under the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations.  Sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium contribute to the hardness of the water and results are used to help determine the optimal way to treat the water at each water plant.\nThe Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding (RFQ022485).  Two hundred-eight (208) bidders were solicited and two (2) bids were received and opened on August 25, 2022.  \n \nAfter a review of the bid, the lowest bidder Metrohm USA, Inc. did not meet bid specifications.  The Division of Water recommends an award be made for all items to Thermo Electron North American LLC in the amount of $111,824.90 as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. \n  \nSUPPLIER:  Thermo Electron North America LLC, Vendor#008050, Contract Compliance is pending.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $111,824.90 was budgeted for this purchase.  \n \n$0.00 was spent in 2021\n$0.00 was spent in 2020\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with Thermo Electron North American LLC for the purchase of a Ion Chromatography System for the Division of Water;
