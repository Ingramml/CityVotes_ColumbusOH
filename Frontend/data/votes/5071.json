    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a storm water joint basin easement described and recorded in Instrument Number 202203080036689, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”). The Easement burdens real property located in the vicinity of Renner Road {Franklin County Tax Parcel 203-299510} (“Servient Estate”) currently owned by Homewood Corporation, an Ohio for profit corporation. The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed a request by the owner of the Servient Estate to vacate the existing easement and determined that the Easement is no longer needed as a new easement was recorded in Instrument Number 202208170118934. DPU has determined that terminating the City’s rights to the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release the City’s easement rights.
