    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (Mod #12) an existing Construction Administration and Construction Inspection (CA/CI) services agreement with Prime AE Group, Inc. for the 2017 General Construction Contract Project. The services for this contract include oversight of the project during construction to ensure that work performed by the construction contractor conforms to project plans and specifications. Prime AE Group, Inc. will perform the CA/CI services for the Division of Sanitary Sewers and Drains on this project. PRIME AE Group, Inc. has been performing the construction administration and inspection services for CIP 650491-100005.  This modification is required due to the contractor failing to meet the required contract durations and extending the services timeline required.                                                                \n      \nPlanning Area for this modification: 64 - Far South \n \nModification information: CA/CI project 2017 General Construction Contract Project \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:_______$ 48,000.08\n              Original Contract                                                              $ 818,854.35\n              Modification 1                                                                  $ 680,589.29                                          \n            Modification 2                                                                  $   98,106.23     \n            Modification 3                                                                  $ 385,938.01\n            Modification 4                                                                  $ 862,977.80\n            Modification 5                                                                  $ 104,336.39 \n            Modification 6                                                                  $ 263,382.27\n            Modification 7&8                                                             $ 390,245.55\n            Modification 9                                                                  $   71,376.76\n            Modification 10                                                                $ 405,802.13\n            Modification 11                                                                $   99,997.90\n                         Modification 12                                                                                                                     $   48,000.08\n           CONTRACT TOTAL                                                   $4,229,606.76\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \n        This is an unplanned modification. The main driver for this modification is due to the lack of progress of the contractor.  The Contractor was given notice to proceed with the construction on this contract on May 7, 2020.  The Substantial Completion Date for the project was January 2, 2021.  While the contractor did begin submittals and some minor site activities, they did not mobilize to the site fully until January 18, 2021.  The Contractor was granted an extension of the Substantial Completion date until October 22, 2021.  However, the Contractor has not yet started the Operational Demonstration Period that is necessary prior to Substantial Completion.  Nor have they completed all construction necessary for Substantial Completion.\n \n1.3 Reasons other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant.\n                      \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of Mod #12 was determined by negotiations between Prime AE Group and DOSD.\n2.   PROJECT TIMELINE: The project NTP was issued in May of 2020 with a completion date of January 2021.  The Contractor was granted an extension of the Substantial Completion date until October 22, 2021 but they have not achieved it as of this request.  Engineering services during construction are expected to take another 8 months (construction completion, as-built plans, close out documents and warranty).\n \n3.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: Prime AE Group, Inc.: 26-0546656 | MBE | Exp. 3/1/2023 | Vendor # 002102 \n4.   EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \n5.   ECONOMIC IMPACT: This project is being completed to prevent future odor complaints within the project area once the Lockbourne Intermodal Subtrunk sewer is completed.  An evaluation of the proposed subtrunk showed that constructing odor control facilities will be necessary once it is put into service.  This project will allow the City to improve the environment of the neighborhoods in and around the facilities and future subtrunk alignment while fostering a better working relationship with the surrounding community.\n \n6.   FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance requires a transfer within of up to $48,000.08 and an expenditure of up to $48,000.08 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109 and amends the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing Construction Administration and Construction Inspection services agreement with Prime AE Group, Inc. for the 2017 General Construction Contract Project; to authorize the transfer within of up to $48,000.08 and the expenditure of up to $48,000.08 from the Sanitary Sewer Obligation Bond Fund for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, and to amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget.
