    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew and modify the scope of services of a contract (renewal number 3) with ATC Group Services Inc. for an additional year to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000                     .00                     n/a                                                               PO209253                     PY 2020\nModification No. 1 amount                     $45,000.00                     Ord. 0466-2020                                          PO222097                     PY 2020\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $         0.00                     Ord. 2627-2020                                          n/a                                          PY 2021\nRenewal No. 2 amount                                          $         0.00                     Ord. 3042-2021                                          n/a                                          PY 2022\nModification No. 2 amount                     $50,000.00                     Ord. 0759-2022                                          PO320741                     PY 2022\nRenewal No. 3 amount                                          $90,000.00                                                                                                                              PY 2023\nTotal contract amount                                          $230,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to increase the capacity of the City of Columbus to produce high quality, lead based paint inspections, risk assessments, work specifications, and final clearance testing as outlined in the HUD 2012 Guidelines and to generate lead-safe units in a timely and efficient manner for the citizens of Columbus.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014279 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for Licensed Lead Risk Inspector/Assessor services for the Lead Safe Columbus program.  Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2020, with an option to renew until the grant period has been completed.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The department and the vendor wish to modify the contract to add an escalator/de-escalator clause to the contract to account for changes in pricing since the original contract in 2019.\n \nChanges to the contract include:  adding additional funds, extending the contract term one year, and adding an escalator/de-escalator clause to the contract.\n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  While the HUD grant ends in 2023, the department anticipates requesting an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  If HUD grants an extension, the Director may submit future legislation to renew or modify the contract through the new end date of the HUD grant.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant, G441900.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 008453 and expires 9/19/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew (renewal #3) a contract with ATC Group Services Inc. for an additional year, to add up to $90,000.00, and to modify the contract terms, all to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; to authorize the expenditure of up to $90,000.00; and to declare an emergency. ($90,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew a contract with ATC Group Services Inc. for an additional year (ending December 31, 2023), add additional funds, and modify the contract terms to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ014279 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for Licensed Lead Risk Inspector/Assessor services for the Lead Safe Columbus program, two bids were received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved multiple ordinances to modify and renew this contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to renew and modify this contract in order to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development is hereby authorized to renew and modify the contract with ATC Group Services Inc. for lead assessment services to add up to $90,000.00, extend the contract term one year, and add an escalator/de-escalator clause to the contract.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $90,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary is hereby authorized in Fund 2220 (General Government Grant fund), Dept-Div 44-10 (Housing), in Object Class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
