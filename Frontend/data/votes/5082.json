    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew (renewal number 3) a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC, dba Homewood Suites, in an amount up to $67,000.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000.00                     n/a                                                               PO220351                     PY 2020\nRenewal No. 1                                                               $         0.00                     n/a                                                                                                         PY 2021\nRenewal No. 2                                                               $22,000.00                     Ord. 3043-2021                                          PO306789                     PY 2022\nRenewal No. 3                                                               $67,000.00                                                                                                                              PY 2023\nTotal Contract Amount                                          134,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide hotel services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2019 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus program. Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with two bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19. The original contract was PO220351 and expired December 31, 2021.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The fee for services in the new contract term will be the same as that of the original contract. \n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  While the HUD grant ends in 2023, the department anticipates requesting an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  If HUD grants an extension, the Director may submit future legislation to renew or modify the contract through the new end date of the HUD grant.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the fund 2220 grant G441900 for this purpose.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 031229 and expires 10/14/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC dba Homewood Suites in an amount up to $67,000.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program; to authorize the expenditure of up to $67,000.00 in the General Government Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($67,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC, dba Homewood Suites, for an additional year to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2020 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus program, two bids were received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation will authorize the contract for an additional year, from January1, 2023, to December 31, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC, dba Homewood Suites, to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to renew a contract with H.S.
