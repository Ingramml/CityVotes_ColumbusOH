    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew and modify the scope of services of a contract (renewal number 3) with Treasurer Franklin County through Franklin County Public Health for an additional year to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000                     .00                                                                                    PO209571                     PY 2020                     \nModification No. 1 amount                     $45,000.00                     Ord. 0467-2020                                          PO239190                     PY 2020\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $         0.00                     Ord. 2699-2020                                                                                    PY 2021\nRenewal No. 2 amount                                          $         0.00                      Ord. 3038-2021                                                                                    PY 2022\nRenewal No. 3 amount                                          $90,000.00                                                                                                                              PY 2023\nTotal contract amount                                          $180,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to increase the capacity of the City of Columbus to produce high quality, lead based paint inspections, risk assessments, work specifications, and final clearance testing as outlined in the HUD 2012 Guidelines and to generate lead-safe units in a timely and efficient manner for the citizens of Columbus.\n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014279 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for Licensed Lead Risk Inspector/Assessor services for the Lead Safe Columbus program.  Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Codes Section 329.19.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2020, with an option to renew until the grant period has been completed.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract. The department and the vendor wish to modify the contract to add an escalator/de escalator clause to the contract to account for changes in pricing since the original contract in 2019.\n \nChanges to the contract include:  adding additional funds, extending the contract term one year, and adding an escalator/de-escalator clause to the contract.\n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  While the HUD grant ends in 2023, the department anticipates requesting an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  If HUD grants an extension, the Director may submit future legislation to renew or modify the contract through the new end date of the HUD grant.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption as an interruption in services will negatively affect the health of program recipients.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is not needed for this renewal.  Funding remaining on the original purchase order and modification number one shall be utilized under this contract renewal.  Funding is available in the of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant, G441900.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006183 and expires 10/18/2024.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract (renewal number 3) with Treasurer Franklin County through Franklin County Public Health for an additional year, to add up to $90,000.00, and to modify the contract terms, all to provide lead risk inspection/assessor services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; to authorize the expenditure of up to $90,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
