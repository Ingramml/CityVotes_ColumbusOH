    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew (renewal number 3) the contract with Inservice Training Network for an additional year for professional development/certification services for city staff who administer the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000                     .00                                                                                    PO222797                     PY 2020\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $         0.00                     Ord. 2626-2020                                                                                    PY 2021\nRenewal No. 2 amount                                          $         0.00                                                                                                                              PY 2022\nRenewal No. 3 amount                                          $         0.00                                                                                                                              PY 2023\nTotal contract amount                                          $45,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to increase the capacity of the City of Columbus to produce high quality, lead based paint inspections, risk assessments, work specifications, and final clearance testing as outlined in the HUD 2012 Guidelines and to generate lead-safe units in a timely and efficient manner for the citizens of Columbus.\n \nThe Director of Development entered into contract with Inservice Training Network under the provision of Columbus City Code Section 329.19 in April 2020.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2020.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract.\n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  While the HUD grant ends in 2023, the department anticipates requesting an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  If HUD grants an extension, the Director may submit future legislation to renew or modify the contract through the new end date of the HUD grant.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption as an interruption in services will negatively affect the health of program recipients.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is not needed for this renewal.  Funding remaining on the original purchase order shall be utilized under this contract renewal.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 005113 and expires 10/18/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew the contract with Inservice Training Network for an additional year for professional development/certification services for city staff who administer the Lead Safe Columbus program; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew the contract with Inservice Training Network for an additional year for professional development/certification services for city staff who administer the Lead Safe Columbus program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development entered into an original contract with Inservice Training Network under the provision of Columbus City Code Section 329.19 in April 2020; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to renew this contract to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to renew the contract with Inservice Training Network for an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
