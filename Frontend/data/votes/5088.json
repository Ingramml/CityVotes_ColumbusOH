($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew (renewal number 1) a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC. dba Towneplace Suites Columbus Easton to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $50,000.00                     Ord. 0323-2022                                          PY 2022\nRenewal No. 1                                                               $         0.00                                                                                    PY 2023\nTotal Contract Amount                                          $50,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide hotel services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2019 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus program. Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with two bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19. The original contract was PO258533 and expired December 31, 2021.  Because a contract renewal number 1, authorized under ordinance 3044-2021, was not executed before the original contract expired, an additional ordinance (Ord. No. 0323-2022) was needed to provide services in 2022.  Thus, this ordinance, is renewal number 1 to the latest original contract.\n \nBecause the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The fee for services in the new contract term will be the same as that of the original contract. \n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  While the HUD grant ends in 2023, the department anticipates requesting an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  If HUD grants an extension, the Director may submit future legislation to renew or modify the contract through the new end date of the HUD grant.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption as an interruption in services will negatively affect the health of program recipients.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  To date, a contract has not been executed under the authority of ordinance 0323-2022.  A contract, with an end date of December 31, 2023, shall be executed using the funding from ordinance 0323-2022 (ACPO007382) and the term extension from this ordinance.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033213 and expires 10/14/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to renew (renewal number 1) a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC., dba Towneplace Suites Columbus Easton, to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew (renewal number 1) a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC. dba Towneplace Suites Columbus Easton to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2019 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus program, two bids were received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to renew this contract to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to renew (renewal number 1) a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC., dba Towneplace Suites Columbus Easton, to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus program.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
