    "title": "To authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the psychological screening of public safety recruits; to authorize the expenditure of $320,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($320,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nNeed:  This ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission, contingent upon passage of Ordinance 2853-2022 and the transfer of funds included therein, to increase a contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice (ForPsych) for psychological screening of public safety recruits for upcoming classes at the Police Academy and the Fire Academy.\n \nThe Civil Service Commission needs to increase the maximum authorized expenditure in the current contract with ForPsych in order to add funds for upcoming screening services. Funding is typically added annually or prior to each academy class.  As part of our 2022 budget development, Finance advised us they were purposefully under-funding entry-level safety psychological screenings but would monitor expenses as the year progressed and identify additional funds as determined necessary.  The original academy classes identified for 2022 were two (2) Police Officer classes of 35 each (total of 70), and two (2) Firefighter classes of 35 each (total of 70).  As the year progressed it was determined by Public Safety that there would need to be (3) Police Officer classes totaling 170 recruits, one (1) “lateral” class of (50) out-of-jurisdiction Police Officer recruits, and three Firefighter classes totaling 135 recruits. So, knowing the original 140 psychological assessments needed were under-funded to begin with, and then accommodating the increase in classes/recruits requiring a total of approximately 450 additional psychological assessments to cover upcoming Police and Fire classes beginning in December and first quarter of 2023, it becomes quickly evident how our original budget appropriation was grossly under-funded and a significant increase in funding is now required.\n \nSince this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process (see below), the contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes.  Pricing for the additional assessments is in accordance with bid pricing previously submitted by ForPsych for 2022/23 services.\n \nBid Information:  The City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ 019812) for these services and accepted proposals through October 8, 2021.  Three proposals were received by the deadline. An evaluation committee reviewed all proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP which included quality and feasibility of proposals, cost, competence, ability, past performance, and timeliness of reporting results.  \n \nBased upon the committee’s review and ranking of the submitted proposals, it was determined that ForPsych was the best and most responsive bidder for the required services.  Therefore, the Commission awarded the contract to ForPsych for the psychological assessment services beginning January 1, 2022.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested in order to increase the contract immediately so that needed assessment services can be completed for police and fire academy classes scheduled for December 2022.\n \nContract Compliance Number:  CC033463, expires October 18, 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these services was partially budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2022 General Fund budget, and can be covered by remaining and increased Object Class 03 funds previously appropriated and recently transferred in to the Commission budget by the Department of Finance and Management with the passage of Ordinance 2853-2022. \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the psychological screening of public safety recruits; to authorize the expenditure of $320,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($320,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2021, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for psychological screening services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded a contract to ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice based upon the submissions of RFQ019812; and,\n \nWHEREAS, for 2022, One Hundred and Twenty-five Thousand dollars ($125,000.00) have been authorized to ForPsych for the provision of psychological screening services; and\n \nWHEREAS the current contract is insufficient to pay for upcoming services needed to fill 2022 academy classes and it is therefore now necessary to increase the value of the current contract with ForPsych, contingent upon the passage of Ordinance 2853-2022 authorizing the transfer of funds from the Department of Finance and Management; and,\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to modify the contract with ForPsych in order to continue scheduling police and fire recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be, and is hereby, authorized to modify the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the purpose of administering additional psychological screenings to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2.  That, upon passage of Ordinance 2853-2022, the additional expenditure of $320,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
