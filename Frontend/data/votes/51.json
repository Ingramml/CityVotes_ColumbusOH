    "description": "Explanation\nThe Human Resources Director requests to modify and extend the existing contract with the YMCA of Central Ohio to operate the Front Street Fitness Center for one year and to provide funding from February 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022 for this program. \n \nThe city’s current contract with the YMCA requires them to execute the daily operations of the city’s employee fitness center and expires in January, 2021.  The YMCA of Central Ohio has over 30 years of experience and a unique ability to engage city employees and their family members in wellness and physical activity.  \nThe Human Resources Department is making this request primarily as a result of the lack of use at the Center resulting from the nation’s ongoing health crisis as well as the uncertainty of operational safety requirements once the center is fully open.  The department plans to bid this contract out in 2021 for February 1, 2022 start date.\nThe maximum program fees for employee fitness center management services from February 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022 will not exceed $60,240. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency action is requested to ensure employee fitness center management services for city employees are able to commence as soon as contractually possible, thereby maintaining continuity of service.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available from and within the 2021 Employee Benefits Fund for this contract.  This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2021 insurance appropriation ordinance 0020-2021.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Human Resources Director to modify and extend the contract with The YMCA of Central Ohio to provide employee fitness center management services from February 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022; to authorize the expenditure of up to $60,240.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay the costs of said contract; and to declare an emergency. ($60,240.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to modify and extend the existing contract with the YMCA of Central Ohio for one year from February 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Human Resources Department will bid these services out in 2021 for a start date of February 1, 2022; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $60,240, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay contract costs for employee fitness center management services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify and extend the existing contract with the YMCA of Central Ohio to ensure employee fitness center management services for city employees are able to commence as soon as contractually possible, thereby maintaining continuity of service;  Now, Therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                      That the Human Resources Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the existing contract with The YMCA of Central Ohio to provide employee fitness center management services from February 1, 2021 through January 31, 2022. \n \nSECTION 2.                       That the expenditure of $60,240 or so much thereof as may be necessary for coverage is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment of this ordinance.  \n \nSECTION 3.                     That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage, if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
