    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to transfer $400,000.00 within the general fund from the Department of Finance and Management, Division of Financial Management, to the Department of Human Resources, to allow the Department of Human Resources Director to fund two new projects in early 2023.  \n \nProject One will be to contract with a consultant to complete a comprehensive compensation study in which all 660+ job classifications within the City will be reviewed and analyzed.  The overarching goal is to retain and attract the best employees to the City.  To accomplish that goal, it is necessary to assess how competitive the city is in the market and make results-based corresponding and appropriate changes. This is estimated to cost $250,000.00.\n  \nProject Two is the purchase of labor relations costing software.  This software will be used by both the Human Resources Department and the Finance and Management Department to cost out various proposals exchanged by the city and unions during labor negotiations.  This will provide a real time assessment of total costs for any proposal to modify compensation and benefits for any union or employee group. This software automation aims to increase the efficiency of cost forecasting and take human error out of the equation.  This is estimated to cost $150,000.00.\n \nIn addition, this ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $400,000.00 to fund these two projects.\n \nSeparate RFPs will be bid for each project.  The department’s goal is to bid both these projects in 2022 and assess and score proposals from vendors as soon as they are back.\n \nAfter proposals have been accepted, the Human Resources Department will submit ordinances seeking Council authorization to enter into contracts. \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so the transfer of funds can be made in 2022 and a certificate can be established prior to the City Auditor’s 2022 year-end deadline.\n \nFiscal Impact: $400,000.00 is available for transfer from Finance and Management Department, Division of Financial Management, Citywide Account, in 2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the general fund, from the Department of Finance and Management, Division of Financial Management, to the Department of Human Resources, general fund, to allow the Human Resources Director to fund a comprehensive compensation study and purchase labor relations cost modeling software; to authorize the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $400,000.00 for these projects; and to declare an emergency.
