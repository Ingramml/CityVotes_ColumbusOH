    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Columbus Department of Development to petition the Director of the Ohio Department of Development to amend the certification of an area designated within the City of Columbus (City) as a Community Reinvestment Area (CRA).  CRAs have been designated by Columbus City Council (Council) under the general guidelines of Ordinance 1698-78.  Such areas allow for the granting of real property tax incentives to encourage industrial, commercial and residential growth.  This designated area, currently known as the South Grove CRA, number 049-18000-31, was authorized by Council by Resolution No. 0218X-78, passed on August 3, 1978 and certified by the State of Ohio on September 3, 1978.\n \nThis ordinance will amend the existing South Grove CRA by (1) renaming the South Grove CRA to be the Southside Investment District CRA (the “CRA”); (2) to revise the improvements eligible for abatement within the CRA; and by (3) adding approximately 8,931 acres as described in Attachments A-1 and A-2 (City of Columbus Community Reinvestment Area Expansion Map (A-1) and List of Parcels to be added to the CRA (A-2)).  This addition is comprised of 1,959 individual parcels within the City of Columbus, contiguous with the current boundary of the CRA but not currently within the boundary of the CRA.\n \nApproximately ninety percent (90.0%) of the parcels to be added to the CRA are within the Columbus City School District (CCSD), five percent (5.0%) are within the Groveport Madison Local School District, one percent (1.0%) will be within the Hamilton Local School District (HMSD) and four percent (4.0%) will be  within the South-Western City School District (SWCSD). This CRA, as amended herein, results in sixty-two percent (62%) of the area is within the CCSD, six percent (6%) of the area to be added is within the GMLSD, seventeen percent (17%) of the area to be added is within the HLSD and fifteen percent (15%) of the area to be added is within the SWCSD.\n \nThis amending ordinance is the first of the “first two amendments” as defined in Sections 3735.661(A) and 3735.661(B) of the Ohio Revised Code (Pre-1994 community reinvestment area term extension) as related to Section 3 of Am. S.B. 19 of the 120th General Assembly and will authorize the expansion of the CRA and will continue to provide the City the ability to offer real property tax abatements for parcels within the expansion area described in Exhibits A1, A2 and A3.\n \nThe Columbus City School District, Hamilton Local School District, Groveport Madison Local School District and the South-Western City School District have been advised of this proposal as required under State law.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to petition the Ohio Department of Development to amend the existing South Grove Community Reinvestment Area as established by the Ohio Revised Code to (1) rename the Community Reinvestment Area as the Southside Investment District Community Reinvestment Area (the “CRA”); (2) to revise the improvements eligible for abatement within the CRA; and (3) to add approximately 8,931 acres of land within the City of Columbus, contiguous with the current boundary of the CRA but not currently within the boundary of the CRA.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Council desires to pursue all reasonable and legitimate incentive measures to assist in encouraging housing maintenance and economic and community development in areas that have not benefited from reinvestment through renovation or new construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1698-78, approved by City Council on August 3, 1978, authorized the Columbus Department of Development to implement a Community Reinvestment Program, pursuant to Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code, and approved certain administrative procedures for the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, on August 3, 1978, City Council approved Resolution No. 0218X-78 designating the South Grove CRA as a Community Reinvestment Area as established by Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, the South Grove CRA has been assigned the CRA number 049-18000-31 by the Ohio Department of Development and was certified by the State of Ohio on September 3, 1978; and\n \nWHEREAS, the proposed area and its immediate vicinity have been surveyed and has been found to meet the criteria for designation of a Community Reinvestment Area; and\n \nWHEREAS, the opportunity exists to modify the boundaries of the South Grove Community Reinvestment Area to include parcels within the expansion area shown on Exhibits A1, A2 and A3 (the Expansion Area); and\n \nWHEREAS, this amending ordinance is the first of the “first two amendments” as defined in Sections 3735.661(A) and 3735.661(B) of the Ohio Revised Code (Pre-1994 community reinvestment area term extension) as related to Section 3 of Am.
