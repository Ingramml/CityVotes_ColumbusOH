    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a non-profit services contract in an amount up to $560,000.00 with Smart Columbus LLC. Smart Columbus LLC is the non-profit organization created to continue the efforts of the Smart Columbus US Department of Transportation Grant.\n \nThis contract is in addition to, and provides additional funds, to continue work authorized via ordinances 3301-2021 and 0670-2022, both of which authorized contracts between the Development Director and Smart Columbus. \n \nSmart Columbus was established to be an agile and collaborative innovation lab delivering impact through the following elements: \n \n● Thought leadership is developing and advocating for a point of view on the future of cities, convening like-minded cities, our community and partners to accelerate learning and imagine a different future together, and inspire future change by telling the story of the ecosystem’s work and impact and uplifting stories of impact across the region.\n \n● Fostering an ecosystem of partnerships motivated by, invested in, and taking action toward, a shared vision through counsel; connecting partners; developing strategies; and building and deploying solutions. \n \n● Delivering impact through human-centered, technology-enabled solutions co-created with the community. Project include intersectional; new and next; impactful, doable, and real. These projects are undertaken under the following business models:\no                     Incubation Model: The organization will proactively invest in an idea or domain area, taking it through incubation, market analysis, and product development with invested resources. This direct influence on creating a solution requires high investment but allows for building and influencing of solutions to impact a defined area of work. The projects are longer term commitments and iterative to get to impact outcomes and are funded by grants and community investment.\no                     Consulting Model: This model uses Smart Columbus as project manager on selected projects or ideas owned by existing entities, businesses and/or partners. Engagements could be more short term and are funded by a project management fee. \n \n● Support plans and activities related to the City’s broadband and digital equity initiatives with Smart Columbus. These funds will also be used to study and plan further efforts to scale solutions that close the digital divide in the city.\n \nThe City's Department of Technology and the Franklin County Digital Equity Coalition (a collaboration of organizations across the city, including the Columbus Metropolitan Libraries, the YWCA, Jewish Family Services, MORPC, NDIA, etc.) are working to find ways to provide affordable and quality internet to opportunity neighborhoods in the city. During the pandemic, the city piloted in two (2) neighborhoods, thus providing a foundation for moving forward with the program across the city. \n \nThe services being funded by this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees as they are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEMERGENCY \nEmergency action is requested so that Smart Columbus LLC can find ways to provide affordable and quality internet to opportunity neighborhoods in the city without delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for the above described services was identified in DoT’s second quarter financial report.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor #: 040255, expiring 11/30/23\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a non-profit services contract with Smart Columbus LLC in an amount up to $560,000.00 to support the ongoing efforts and work of the Smart Columbus organization; to authorize the expenditure of $560,000.00 from the Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
