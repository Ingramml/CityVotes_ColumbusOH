    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) accepted applications to fund projects that address locations with a history of fatal or injury crashes where low-cost safety improvements have failed to solve the problem.  The Highway Safety Improvement Program accepts formal safety applications once a year, on August 31; and it accepts abbreviated safety applications four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.  These grants require a 10% local match.\n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications seeking funds to construct safety improvements at (1) the intersection of Dublin-Granville Road (SR-161) at Busch Boulevard, (2) the intersection of Bethel Road at Dierker Road, and (3) the Gantz Road bridge over I-270. This ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute project agreements for approved projects, to accept and expend grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications for the projects listed below:\n \n538022-100000 - Intersection - Busch Blvd at Dublin Granville Road: This project includes improvements to intersection of Dublin Granville Road and Busch Boulevard as well as modifications to the mainline Dublin Granville Road to mitigate crash patterns.  The project also includes changes to the south leg of Busch Blvd to mitigate crashes associated with Roche Dr.  This project will include widening, signal work, signing, intersection, and striping upgrades.  This is a formal safety application, and the total project cost is approximately $3,493,300.00.\n \n598029-100000 - Intersection - Bethel Road at Dierker Road: This project includes safety modifications to the intersection of Bethel Road at Dierker Road.  These modifications include the removal of portions of Bethel Road’s concrete median to reduce the negative offset of the turn lanes and improve sight distance along Bethel Road.  This is an abbreviated safety application, and the total project cost is approximately $133,373.00\n \n590105-100476 - Pedestrian Safety - Gantz Road Bridge over I-270: This project includes improvements to ODOT’s Gantz Road bridge over I-270.  ODOT has a project to rehabilitate the existing bridge over I-270.  The City of Columbus would partner with ODOT to add pedestrian facilities to the bridge.  This is an ODOT led project.  This is a formal safety application, and the total cost for the additional pedestrian improvements is approximately $1,860,000.00.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) accepts formal applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds until August 31, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT accepts abbreviated applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service submitted applications seeking funds to construct roadway and pedestrian safety improvements at various locations throughout the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Deparetment of Public Service to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with ODOT, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to execute grant agreements, with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program and to accept and expend awarded grant funds.\n \nSECTION 2.  The Department of Public Service plans to submit applications for the projects listed above.  City Council understands and approves that this list may change at the discretion of the Director of Public Service if other projects are found to be good candidates to be awarded these grant funds or if a reason should be found not to submit one of the listed projects.\n \nSECTION 3.  The Department of Public Service is authorized to issue refunds of awarded or reimbursed grant funds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued. \n \nSECTION 4.  That, at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which those funds originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
