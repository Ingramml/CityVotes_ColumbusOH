    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Public Safety Director, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract for a preventative maintenance agreement and to purchase parts, accessories and supplies, on an as needed basis, with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the maintenance and repair of Stryker Power Load Cots for use in daily emergency services and emergency medical service (EMS) operations, and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code.  In 2018-2019, the Division of Fire standardized on Stryker Power Load Cots for their emergency medical squads.  Stryker Power Load Cots are purchased on a continuing basis for installation in all new-build emergency medical squads, and Stryker consumable parts (pads, straps, batteries, etc.) are purchased at regular intervals due to the normal daily utilization of these cots.  The Division of Fire purchases these cots and supplies directly from Stryker versus a resale provider which allows the Division to secure the lowest pricing available on these products given our purchasing volume.  As the Division of Fire has standardized on the Stryker Power Load Cot product, it is critical that the Division be able to maintain a stock of both this equipment and consumable supplies.  Stryker Sales Corporation LLC is the manufacturer, distributor and authorized service agent of and for the Stryker Power Load Cots.\n \nBid Waiver Justification:  The Division of Fire has the ability to purchase directly from Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for Stryker Power Load Cots, related consumable supplies, and preventative maintenance.  This eliminates any mark-up from distributors ensuring the lowest available price on Stryker products.\n \nContract Compliance:  Stryker Sales Corporation LLC (FID #38-2902424 / Vendor #030281)\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested as funds for the ambulance cot consumable supplies are needed to keep supplies stocked at adequate levels, and to establish a preventative maintenance agreement.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $110,543.00 from the Division of Fire's general fund operating budget to purchase ambulance cot consumable supplies, and to establish a preventative maintenance agreement. This ordinance is contingent upon the passage of the 2021 General Fund Budget, ordinance 2502-2020.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Public Safety Director, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract for a preventative maintenance agreement and to purchase parts, accessories and supplies, on an ongoing basis, with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the maintenance and repair of Stryker Power Load Cots for use in daily emergency services and emergency medical service (EMS) operations; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; and to authorize the expenditure of $110,543.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($110,543.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, there is a need for the Division of Fire to purchase Stryker Power Load Cots and consumable supplies for use in daily emergency services and emergency medical service (EMS) operations from Stryker Sales Corporation; and,\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need within the Division of Fire to establish a preventative maintenance agreement with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the maintenance and repair of Stryker Power Load Cots; and,\n \nWHEREAS,  it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $110,543.00 from the General Fund; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 to purchase directly from Stryker Sales Corporation LLC in order to receive the best possible pricing; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management, through its Purchasing Office, and to authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into contracts with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for supplies and preventative maintenance services, respectively; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Fire, Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Public Safety Director to enter into contracts with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the purchase of Stryker Power Load Cots, along with consumable supplies, and a preventative maintenance agreement for said equipment, respectively, in order to maintain adequate levels of such supplies, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, property, safety, and welfare of the public; now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Public Safety Director be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract for Stryker Power Load Cots and consumable supplies, as needed, with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC on behalf of the Division of Fire.  \n \nSECTION 2. That the Public Safety Director be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract for preventative maintenance services for Stryker Power Load Cots with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC on behalf of the Division of Fire.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.   \n \nSECTION 4.  That the expenditure of $110,543.00, or so much thereof as is necessary, is hereby authorized from the Division of Fire's General Operating Fund Budget, as per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 5. That this Council finds it to be in the best interests of the City to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to Competitive bidding for this purchase.\n \nSECTION 6.
