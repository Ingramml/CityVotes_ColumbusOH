    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1852-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on July 11, 2022, to allow for reimbursement of project related expenses incurred before the purchase order for the original grant agreement was approved by the City.\n \nOrdinance No. 1169-2020, passed by City Council on June 1, 2020, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) for the Project.  The HDA stated that the city would provide up to $500,000.00 through two installment payments of $250,000.00 each.  The first installment was authorized under Ordinance 0780-2021 and the second installment was authorized under Ordinance 1852-2022.  During the drafting of Ordinance No. 1852-2022, the department inadvertently left out the request to pay for expenses incurred before the purchase order for the original grant agreement was approved by the City.  The developer of the project is Erie Ohio Capital, CDFI, LLC.  \n \nThe Jenkins Street project is an approximately 60 multi-family residential unit, low income housing tax credit rental project consisting of 15 one bedroom units, 30 two bedroom units, and 15 three bedroom units (subject to final design and requite approvals).  All of the units will be occupied by and affordable to households in affordable tiers of 30%, 50%, 60%, and 70%, but not exceeding 80% of the area median income. Other developers involved in the Project include Woda-Cooper Development and Community Development for All People.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the project schedule, which is in the closeout phase.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033062 and expires 6/24/2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 1852-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on July 11, 2022, to allow for payments of project related expenses that have been incurred before the purchase order for the original grant agreement was approved by the City; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1852-2022 authorized the Director of Development to modify a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI, LLC for the Jenkins Street project; and\n \nWHEREAS, the department inadvertently left out the request to pay for project expenses that were incurred before the PO for the original grant agreement was approved by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development requests that Ordinance No. 1852-2022 be amended in order to pay for project expenses incurred before the PO for the original grant agreement was approved by the City: and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to amend Ordinance No. 1852-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on July 11, 2022, in order to maintain the project schedule, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, property, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That Section 4 of Ordinance No. 1852-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on July 11, 2022, be amended to read as follows:  “SECTION 4.  That the Director of Development is hereby authorized to modify a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI, LLC, in an amount up to $250,000.00, for the Jenkins Street project and to allow payments for project related expenses incurred before the purchase order for the original grant agreements was approved by the city.” \n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes it.",
