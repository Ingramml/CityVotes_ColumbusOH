    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Civil Service Commission needs to enter into a contract, contingent upon passage of Ordinance 2853-2022 and the transfer of funds included therein, with a vendor yet to be selected for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits for upcoming Police and Fire Academy classes.  \n \nBid Information:  The Commission is in the process of soliciting proposals for the provision of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits, but will be unable to complete the proposal assessment, vendor selection, and associated legislative actions prior to Council’s last meeting of this year, December 12, 2022.  As such, the Commission is asking that initial funds for the assessment services be encumbered now, and its executive director be authorized to enter into contract with the successful bidder selected in accordance with applicable provisions of City Code 329.\n \nThe current contract for provision of required medical/stress assessment expires February 28, 2023.  In the past, finalizing the RFP and selection process immediately following the passage of the budget in February would have enabled us to have candidates through medicals in time for the typical June and December recruit classes.  However, with the likelihood of an additional recruit class being scheduled for April 2023, medicals would now need to be completed in February and early March of 2023, prior to the finalization of the 2023 General Fund Budget.  Consequently, funds from the Commission’s 2022 appropriation will need to be authorized and encumbered to cover assessments completed in these two months.  Approval of this ordinance would eliminate the need for any further action by Council, authorize contract execution, and ensure monies are in place that, all together, would result in no disruption to the assessment and provision of recruits for the April 2023 police and fire classes.  \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested as the authorization to encumber 2022 funds for these medical/stress services will need to occur by Council’s December 12, 2022 meeting in order that the assessments may continue through the first three months of 2023 resulting in sufficient numbers of candidates being available for the April 2023 recruit classes.\n \nContract Compliance Number:  N/A\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding for this service is contingent upon passage of Ordinance 2853-2022 and the transfer of funds included therein.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to enter into a contract with a vendor selected in accordance with applicable provisions of City Code for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits for the Divisions of Police and Fire; to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($40,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission is in the process of soliciting proposals from qualified vendors for medical services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Commission’s executive director will need to be able to enter into contract for said medical services and 2022 dollars will need to be encumbered to pay for said medical services provided prior to the adoption of the 2023 General Fund Budget; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the last opportunity to authorize the use of 2022 dollars for said medical services is December 12, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with a vendor yet to be selected and to encumber necessary funds in order that medical assessment services may continue through the first three months of 2023 resulting in sufficient numbers of candidates being available for the April 2023 recruit classes, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; now therefore:\n   \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with a vendor selected in accordance with applicable provisions of City Code 329 for the purpose of administering pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress tests to public safety recruits for the Divisions of Police and Fire.\n \nSECTION 2.  That, upon passage of Ordinance 2853-2022, the expenditure of $40,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in object class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
