During negotiations with the selected vendor for the Enhanced Meter Project, the department determined that using a Software-as-a-service (SAAS) and Managed Services model, which will include the vendor hosting all data and software on their computer servers as well as maintaining the system, is in the best interest of the City and the Division of Water.  This operating contract is for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the system and software to ensure the system implemented as part of the Enhanced Meter Project is usable. As legislated under Ord #1024-2020, the Enhanced Meter Project CIP will replace outdated and underperforming meters, install radio transmitting infrastructure to allow wireless readings relayed to the billing software at a central location, and provide an environmentally efficient way to read meters.  This is an operating contract which was negotiated after a vendor was selected as part of the Enhanced Meter Project legislated under Ordinance 1024-2020.\n \nOrdinance 1266-2020 was approved in July 2020 to accept the contract and provide $275,000 in funding. \n \nOrdinance 0626-2021 was approved in March 2021 to provide $1,350,000 in funding through March 31, 2022. \n \nOrdinance 1298-2022 was approved in June 2022 to provide $250,000 in funding through March 31, 2023. \n \nThis current request is planned and is to add $1,100,000 in funding through March 31, 2024.\n \nFuture anticipated needs include $1,550,000.00 for services ending March 31, 2025 and $1,600,000.00 for services ending March 31, 2026.\n \nPlanning area - 99 (Entire service area including suburbs)\n \nIf unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.
