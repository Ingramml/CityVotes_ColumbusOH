    "title": "To amend Sections 1137.01, 1147.01 and 1147.11 of the Columbus City Codes to revise sewer charge definitions, revise the discretion to reduce sewer front footage fees, and enact new sanitary sewer service rates for the year beginning January 1, 2023; and to repeal the existing sections being amended.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance revises sewer charge definitions, revises discretion to reduce sewer front footage fees, and authorizes an increase in sewer rates effective January 1, 2023 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and to amend Chapter 1147 of the Columbus City Codes, 1959.\n \nSewer charge definitions need to be revised from time to time and in this ordinance grit waste is being added to the list of \"Scavenger wastes\" which are usually collected at the source by tank truck for disposal. \n \nThis ordinance also eliminates the authority of the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to reduce the amount of the front footage fee per section 1137.01 due to the infrequency of reduction requests and lack of a promulgated rule. \n \nThe proposed rate configuration for 2023 recognizes that water and sewer charges disproportionately affect lower income groups. The Department of Public Utilities will continue the Low Income Discount Program that discounts participant's sewer commodity portion of their sewer bill by 20%.  \n \nRequested adjustments in rates result in a typical inside city residential sewer rate increase of 5%.  When a water increase of 4% and a 2% increase in stormwater rates are considered, the overall impact on a typical residential customer's bill in the City of Columbus is 4.45%, and for a typical outside city residential customer, the overall bill impact is 4.51%. Low Income Discount participant's overall bill impact is 4.42%. Outside city customers are not charged stormwater fees. Considering the 2022 rate increases for water, sewer, and storm combined -- based on average household water use of 30 ccf's per quarter, City of Columbus residents are estimated to see their total bill increase $14.07 per quarter, or $56.29 per year. \n \nIn 2005, in accordance with Ordinance No.1904-2005, passed November 28, 2005, Council created a Clean River Fee to recover costs of construction of projects necessary to meet the requirements of the two consent orders that mandate elimination of wet weather flow from Combined Sewer Overflows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows. This charge was assessed based on each property's measured impervious surface area. Since 2005, Council has approved across-the-board rate increases, including the Clean River Fee. The Department of Public Utilities, with approval of the Sewer and Water Advisory Board (SWAB), recommends that the Clean River Fee again be increased with an across-the-board rate increase of 5% to continue to allow wet weather construction projects to be paid for by a blend of the Clean River Fee and Commodity Charges.\n \nThe proposed rate structure is necessary to continue to address projects related to the two (2) consent orders entered into in 2002 and 2004 mandating the City of Columbus to mitigate wet weather flow from Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) and Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSO) and other operating costs and infrastructure improvements. \n \nThe Division of Sewerage and Drainage charges some industrial customers an extra strength charge. Extra strength charges are for the treatment of high strength wastewater generated by various industries that require additional treatment processes within the wastewater treatment plants. To stay economically competitive, the Department of Public Utilities is recommending an increase of extra strength charges for inside-city and outside-city BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) by 5% beginning January 1, 2023 and an increase to outside-city TKN (Total Kjeldal Nitrogen) 2% beginning January 1, 2023. No changes are recommended to TSS (Total Suspended Solids) Extra Strength Charges beginning January 1, 2023.\n \nThe Sewer and Water Advisory Board (SWAB) met on October 19, 2022, and after reviewing the Department of Public Utilities' projected expenditures for Fiscal Year 2023, recommends to City Council a 5% increase in sewer rates and extra strength increases for inside-city and outside-city BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) by 5% and an increase to outside-city TKN (Total Kjeldal Nitrogen) by 2% starting January 1, 2023. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  These rate increases will generate approximately $12.2 million in additional revenue in the Sewer Operating Fund in Fiscal Year 2023.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Sections 1137.01, 1147.01 and 1147.11 of the Columbus City Codes to revise sewer charge definitions, revise the discretion to reduce sewer front footage fees, and enact new sanitary sewer service rates for the year beginning January 1, 2023; and to repeal the existing sections being amended.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to eliminate the authority of the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to reduce the amount of the front footage fee per section 1137.01 due to the infrequency of reduction requests and lack of a promulgated rule; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to revise sewer charge definitions from time to time; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to establish new sewer sanitary services rates, effective January 1, 2023, for sewerage services to properties discharging into the sanitary sewerage system of the City of Columbus in order to recover the cost of rendering said sewerage services for the calendar year; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage requests a 5% increase in sewer rates for 2023 to pay for necessary ongoing operations and needed improvements; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage recommends extra strength increases of 5% for inside-city and outside-city BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) and a 2% increase to outside-city TKN (Total Kjeldal Nitrogen) by 2% starting January 1, 2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities requests that sewer capacity fees not be increased in fiscal year 2023, and\n \nWHEREAS, in addition to the commodity rates, City Council finds it necessary to continue a Clean River Fee to fund the wet weather capital improvement projects required by the Consent Orders with the State of Ohio; and \n \nWHEREAS, City Council finds that the most appropriate way to assess the Clean River surcharge is by correlating the surcharge to the amount of impervious surface, as the factor most closely associated with increased inflow and infiltration is impervious cover from urban development; and \n \nWHEREAS, City Council recognizes that increased sewer rates disproportionately impact low income residents.  Low income residents already pay a higher percentage of their household income in utility bills, and this percentage would increase with higher rates; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council further recognizes that past rate increases in the City have demonstrated that increasing rates leads to increased delinquencies among the City's customers; delinquency rates are higher among low income residents.  It is well recognized that increased delinquencies are expensive for the City and its customers; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council finds that continuing the discount rate for low income users at 20% is appropriate to assist those least able to manage the impacts of increased sewer and water rates; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Sewer and Water Advisory Board has adopted recommendations that are consistent with the rates established in this legislation; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council finds that the rates and the low income discount established are equitable to all of the City's customers; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That effective January 1, 2023, Section 1137.01 of the Columbus City Codes be and is hereby amended to read as follows:\n \n1137.01 - Tapping sewer where property not assessed.\n \nUpon application to tap any sewer built by the city for the purpose of draining the service lateral of any property directly into such sewer, the Director of Public Utilities shall require a fee of forty-five dollars ($45.00) per foot of width of front-footage be paid for the privilege of making such a direct connection from the service lateral to the main or lateral sewer before a permit is issued. This charge shall not be imposed if the owner of the property concerned can show that the owner or the owner's predecessor in title paid, or is paying a special assessment for the construction of the sewer to be tapped or that the sewer to be tapped was constructed at no expense to the sanitary enterprise fund. The number of feet to be paid for shall be determined by one of the following applicable methods:\n \n(1)Lots or parcels of ground having the same width at the front and rear and the same depth on each shall be charged for on the basis of the actual frontage.(2)Lots or parcels of ground which are irregular shape shall be charged for on the basis of the width of the property as measured on a line forty (40) feet from the front lot line and parallel to the center line of the street upon which property is to face, except that for lots or parcels of ground having curved frontage the width to be charged for shall be measured on a line parallel to and forty (40) feet distant from a line tangent to the curved frontage at a point midway between the sides of the lots or parcels of ground.\nThe width of front-footage to be paid for shall be determined by the use of an engineer's scale applied to the record drawings of the sewers sought to be tapped, on file in the office of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, and the widths so determined by the clerk issuing the permit shall be final. The amounts collected shall be deposited to the credit of the sewer fund.\n \nThe Director of Public Utilities may, in the Director's sole discretion, may reduce the amount of the front footage fee if the fee is disproportionate to the benefit to the property due to a significant portion of the property not being subject to development. The director shall promulgate a rule to implement this section.\n \nSECTION 2.
