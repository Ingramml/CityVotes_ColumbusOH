    "description": "Explanation\n \nBy Resolution Nos. 0268X-2019 and 0284X-2019, City Council, as the “organizational board of commissioners,” previously established the Marble Cliff Quarry Community Authority (the “Authority”) pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (“ORC”) Chapter 349 to support that redevelopment of approximately 300 acres of real property located at the northeast corner of Dublin Road and Trabue Road adjacent to a new metro park.  Pursuant to Ordinance 3095-2019, the City and the Authority subsequently entered into the Marble Cliff Quarry Utility Cooperative Agreement to authorize the Authority to provide water and sewer service within its new community district.  The Columbus and Franklin County Metropolitan Park District (“Metroparks”) is currently constructing the Quarry Trails Metro Park on land adjacent to the Authority’s new community district.  Metroparks now seeks to join the Authority in order to obtain water and sewer service.  On September 28, 2022, Metroparks submitted to the Clerk of City Council a Consent to Add Property to a New Community District (the “Consent”) to add the Quarry Trails Metro Park parcels to the Authority’s new community district.  City Council, by Resolution No. 0197X-2022, adopted on October 17, 2022, determined the sufficiency of the Consent and set a public hearing date on the Consent, which was held on November 2, 2022.  This resolution authorizes the expansion of and defines the boundaries of the Authority’s new community district by adding the Quarry Trails Metro Park property identified as Tax Parcel ID Nos. 560-298177 and 560-298033.

and to certify compliance of the requirements for the public hearing on the expansion.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to Chapter 349 of the Ohio Revised Code, on August 26, 2019, Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC  filed a petition (the “Petition”) for the establishment of the Marble Cliff Quarry Community Authority (the “Authority”) with the Clerk of City Council; and\nWHEREAs, this Council, as the “organizational board of commissioners” as that term is defined in Section 349.01(F) of the Ohio Revised Code, adopted Resolution No. 0268X-2019 on October 7, 2019, and determined that the Petition complied as to form and substance with the requirements of Section 349.03(A) of the Ohio Revised Code and fixed the time and place for a hearing on the establishment of the Authority;

and\nWHEREAs, Section 349.03(B) of the Ohio Revised Code authorizes this Council to add property to the Authority’s District, with the consent of the owner of the property, so long as the developer who submitted the Petition does not file a written objection; and\nWHEREAS, the Columbus and Franklin County Metropolitan Park District, as owner of the property known as Quarry Trails Metro Park, shown as the “Expansion Area” on Exhibit A attached hereto, filed a written consent with the Clerk of City Council to add such property to the District (the “Consent”) pursuant to Chapter 349.03(B) of the Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, this Council, as the organizational board of commissioners, adopted Resolution No. 0197X-2022 on October 17, 2022, and determined that the Consent complied as to form and substance with the requirements of Section 349.03(B) of the Ohio Revised Code and fixed the time and place for a hearing on the expansion of the Authority’s District; and\nWHEREAS, this Council, as the organizational board of commissioners, authorized the Department of Development to hold a public hearing on the expansion of the Authority’s District on November 2, 2022, after public notice was duly published in accordance with Section 349.03(A) of the Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, the Department of Development certifies to City Council that the public hearing was held as advertised as attested on the Certificate of Compliance with the Public Hearing Requirements attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Certification”);
