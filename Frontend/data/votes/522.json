    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a contract with Sensus USA Inc. to provide ongoing software, hardware, and maintenance of the system that is required as part of the Enhanced Meter Project legislated under ordinance 1024-2020. During negotiations with the selected vendor for the Enhanced Meter Project, the department determined that using a Software-as-a-service (SAAS) and Managed Services model, which will include the vendor hosting all data and software on their computer servers as well as maintaining the system, is in the best interest of the City and the Division of Water.  This operating contract is for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the system and software to ensure the system implemented as part of the Enhanced Meter Project is usable. As legislated under Ord #1024-2020, the Enhanced Meter Project CIP will replace outdated and under performing meters, install radio transmitting infrastructure to allow wireless readings relayed to the billing software at a central location, and provide an environmentally efficient way to read meters.  This is an operating contract which was negotiated after a vendor was selected as part of the Enhanced Meter Project legislated under Ordinance 1024-2020.\n \nThe Initial Term of the contract is from the date of execution through March 31, 2026.  The contract is subject to annual funding approval by Columbus City Council between 2021 to 2025 during the Initial Term.  The Maximum Obligation for the first year of this contract between the contract execution and March 31, 2021 was $275,000.00.  The Division of Water now wishes to add $1,350,000.00 in funding for the second year of the contract between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022.  If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested. The City may, at its option, perform a contract modification under the same terms and conditions, for fifteen additional one-year terms after the Initial Term. Costs for these renewals after the initial term will be negotiated at a future date.\n \nSUPPLIER: SENSUS USA, Inc.  #51-0338883, (exp. 4/13/22, MAJ, DAX#008960)\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds:  The amount of additional funds needed for this contract is $1,350,000.00.  The funding for the first year of the contract, from contract execution through March 31, 2021, was $275,000.00.  This ordinance authorizes an additional $1,350,000.00 for the second year of the contract, from April 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, for a total obligation of $1,625,000.00.\n \n2.                     Reason the need for additional funds was not foreseen:  The need for additional funds was foreseen and provided for in the original contract.  The Initial Term of the contract is from the date of execution through March 31, 2026.  This ordinance provides funding for the second year of the contract.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used:  The Initial Term of the contract is from the date of execution through March 31, 2026.  The City may, at its option, perform a contract modification under the same terms and conditions, for fifteen additional one-year terms after the Initial Term. Costs for these renewals after the initial term will be negotiated at a future date.  No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.                     How cost was determined:  The cost, terms, and conditions are in accordance with the original agreement.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $1,350,000.00 is budgeted and available for this contract in the Water Operating Fund.\n \n2020- $275,000.00\n2019- $0\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: This ordinance is being submitted as an emergency measure in order to expedite the approval of this modification and to avoid delays in paying invoices.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a contract with Sensus USA, Inc. for ongoing software, hardware, and maintenance of the system that is required as part of the Enhanced Meter Project for the Division of Water; to authorize the expenditure of $1,350,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
