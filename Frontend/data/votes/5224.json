    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a contract with ThriveIN LLC to operate their WorkSpace Program. WorkSpace is a professional development, career accelerator program for Gen Z and millennial Black women and women of color. \n \nThe contract with ThriveIN will expand the WorkSpace program, which will provide participants with in-person and virtual programming, mentor-matchmaking, and job training. In addition to professional development activities, WorkSpace will work alongside corporations to recruit and promote additional talented women of color. Their program includes 8-12 months of professional development for a cohort of up to 50 women. In additional to mentoring and personal development opportunities, WorkSpace includes networking opportunities and a unique job portal for women in the program.\n \nWorkSpace is currently the only professional development program in Columbus actively targeting and supporting Gen Z and Millennial black women. Because black women face disproportionate barriers to career advancement, including being made 37% less than white men, this programming is essential to the promotion of pathways out of poverty and to equitable workforce development in Columbus. These services cannot be provided by current City employees at this time.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure timely financial support ahead of the end of the City’s fiscal year and in advance of the WorkSpace program at the beginning of 2023.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a contract with ThriveIN LLC to operate the WorkSpace program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
