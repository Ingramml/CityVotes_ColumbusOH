    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Legacy Youth Sports Academy, a non-profit entity, to support the Exposure is Key Initiative.\n \nLegacy Youth Sports Academy, or LegacyU, is hosting the Exposure is Key Initiative in early 2023, a trip and personal development opportunity for Columbus youth. Exposing youth to opportunities outside of their neighborhoods will give them a window to future dreams and goals. LegacyU seeks to motivate Columbus youth to dream about their future and make decisions that promote their safety and their community engagement. Their Exposure is Key initiative helps improve student achievement, community ties, and build stronger relationships with their mentors.\n \nThe 2023 program will serve 126 youth from ages 6 to 15 years old. LegacyU expects this event to increase youth engagement in their ongoing programs, create permanent positive community connections, promote social-emotional well-being, and expose youth to opportunities beyond their neighborhood. One of the intended goals is to reduce rates of delinquency and violence amongst youth and to increase life skill development, leading towards self-sufficiency at an age-appropriate level.\n \nThe support of Columbus City Council will provide for youth to travel to be exposed to sports and personal development/career opportunities both within and outside their neighborhoods. The event occurs in early 2023, making emergency legislation necessary to support the organization in a timely manner.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Legacy Youth Sports Academy in support of the Exposure is Key Initiative; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
