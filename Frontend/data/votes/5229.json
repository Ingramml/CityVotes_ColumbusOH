Robinson Engineering to add additional funds for design of the Bikeway Development-Georgesville Road SUP - Parkwick Drive to Sullivant Avenue.\nOrdinance 1796-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with E.L. Robinson Engineering for the Bikeway Development- Georgesville Road SUP - Parkwick Drive to Sullivant Avenue project in the amount of $250,000.00.  This project consists of design for a new shared use path (SUP) along the east side of Georgesville Road from Parkwick Drive to Sullivant Avenue (south leg, west of Georgesville).  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of up to $615,000.00.  This modification is necessary to cover the design phase of the project.  The original contract was set up to complete the study phase which delivered a preliminary alignment plan as well as recommendations for sidewalks, lighting, and curb and gutter for the SUP design.  Additional efforts covered in the modification scope will include the detail design work and efforts required to complete the design, right of way plans, and construction plans as well as additional services through the construction phase. It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $250,000.00     (PO282002, Ord. 1796-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $615,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                         $865,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against E.L. Robinson Engineering.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for E.L. Robinson Engineering is CC005858 and expires 2/15/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $504,371.00  is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align funding with the proper project. \n \nThe balance of funding needed will come from ACPO006747 created by Ordinance 1796-2021 has funding available in the amount of $110,629.00 to be used for this project.  \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of this program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to avoid a delay in designing the project and keep on schedule to complete construction in a timely manner, to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with E.L.
