    "description": "Explanation\nBackground\n \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused unforeseen challenges related to virtual learning.  During the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year My Brother’s Keeper partnered with non-profit agencies to fund virtual and in-person academic support for boys and young men of color.  The need for online support continues as communities address the pandemic.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $288,000.00 from the CARES Fund 2207; and authorizes the Director of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with Community Development for All People, Community for New Directions, the Columbus Urban League, and Legacy U in an amount up to $288,000.00 to continue providing academic support services during COVID-19 for boys and young men of color. \n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to ensure that academic support is provided to boys and young men of color as new the remote school year begins.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Fund Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 27, 2020. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \nCommunity Development for All People and is valid from 9/15/2020-9/15/2022\nCommunity for New Directions 005361 and is valid from 8/24/2020-8/24/2022\nColumbus Urban League 006073 and is valid from 4/24/20-4/24/2022\nLegacy U 032877 and is valid from 7/1/2020-7/1/2022\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with  Community Development for All People, Community for New Directions, the Columbus Urban League, and Legacy U in a total amount of up to $288,000.00 to add needed capacity to address COVID-19 specific services for boys and young men of color; to authorize the expenditure of the related expenses starting March 1, 2021 in an amount up to $288,000.00 from the CARES Act Fund; and to declare an emergency.
