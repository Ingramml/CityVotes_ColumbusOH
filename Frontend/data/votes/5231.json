    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with VS Engineering, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Pedestrian Safety - General Engineering 2022-2 project.\nOrdinance 0384-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with VS Engineering, Inc. for the Pedestrian Safety - General Engineering 2022-2 project.  The intent of this project is to provide continuing, contractual access to additional resources that are necessary to perform professional engineering and survey services as well as provide technical expertise for the Department to implement sidewalk and bikeway projects.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $125,000.00. This modification is necessary to cover the negotiated fee for the project.  The original contract was based on an estimate before a scope and task list was finalized.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $361,927.55                     (PO319186/PO319193, Ord. 0384-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $125,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $486,927.55  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against VS Engineering, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for VS Engineering, Inc. is CC031373 and expires 6/25/2022.  The consultant will need to renew their contract compliance number before the contract modification can be executed.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $125,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. Funds are appropriated.\n \n4.
