    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a contribution agreement with and to provide funding to the Short North Alliance relative to the operation of the Short North Ornamental Arches (“Arches”). \nIn 2002, the City of Columbus, in collaboration with the Short North Special Improvement District, installed 17 Arches on High Street between Goodale and Fifth avenues, which pay homage to earlier wooden arches first built in 1888 when Columbus was known as “Arch City”, making the Arches of considerable historical, cultural, and civic importance to Columbus and its residents. Eventually the Arches needed major maintenance, repair, and upgrading, prompting the City, acting through its Department of Public Service, to engage a contractor to perform this work. \nFollowing the restoration of the Arches, the Short North Special Improvement District assumed responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Arches pursuant to an infrastructure maintenance agreement, effective August 19, 2020. That agreement also noted an anticipated need for 960 replacement lights for future use, with the City informally agreeing to provide a portion of the monies necessary to support the fabrication of said lights.  The purchase and installation of the lighting was included in the Downtown Streetscape - Short North SID  - High Street Improvements Phase 3 project, approved by Council via Ordinance 0030-2019, which passed February 4, 2019.  Due to supply chain issues and a long lead time in procuring the bulbs, the Department of Public Service desires to closeout the existing construction project and turn the procurement of the lighting over to the Short North Alliance.    \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to enable the City, acting through the Department of Public Service, to satisfy that obligation by making a one-time, lump sum payment of $159,609.48 to the Short North Alliance to facilitate the procurement of the same.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $159,609.48 is available in Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Non-Bond Fund, Project P530053-100000.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to establish budget authority for the correct project.  The funds are appropriated.\n3.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThe Short North Alliance is a local, non-profit organization, and as such, MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements are not applicable to the proposed expenditure. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to enable the Department of Public Service to make payment to the Short North Alliance as soon as reasonably possible due to supply chain issues and the long lead-time required to obtain the lighting. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute a contribution agreement with and make payment to the Short North Alliance relative to the Short North Ornamental Arches; to authorize the expenditure of up to $159,609.48 from the Street and Highway Non-Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($159,609.48).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Short North Ornamental Arches (“Arches”) are of significant historical, cultural, and civic importance to the City of Columbus and its residents;

and \n \nWHEREAS, eventually the Arches needed major maintenance, repair, and upgrading, prompting the City, acting through its Department of Public Service, to engage a contractor to restore the Arches to perform this work; and \nWHEREAS, following the restoration of the Arches, the Short North Special Improvement District assumed responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Arches pursuant to an infrastructure maintenance agreement, effective August 19, 2020;

and \n \nWHEREAS, the purposes of this ordinance are to authorize the execution of a contribution agreement between the Department of Public Service and the Short North Alliance and the encumbrance and expenditure of funds to facilitate the procurement of the replacement lights; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Short North Alliance is a local, non-profit organization, and as such, MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements are not applicable to the proposed expenditure; and\n \nWHEREAS, an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to provide sufficient budget authority for the proper project; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contribution agreement in order to make payment to the Short North Alliance as soon as reasonably possible due to supply chain issues and the long lead-time required to obtain the lighting;
