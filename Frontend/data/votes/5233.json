    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to accept up to $1,000,000.00 from the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) relative to the Roadway - Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project. This legislation also authorizes the Director of Public Service to, as may be necessary, issue a refund to or accept additional monies from COTA based on the actual cost to complete that project. \n \nThe aforementioned project encompasses converting Front Street between Broad Street and Hickory Street and Marconi Boulevard between Broad Street and Spring Street to two-way operation. Other planned improvements include: upgrading the existing traffic signals; and installing curbs, sidewalks, street and pedestrian lighting, enhanced pedestrian crossings, and landscaping within the project limits. The estimated cost to complete the project is $13,333,365.10, with COTA agreeing to contribute up to $1,000,000.00 toward said cost. However, it may be necessary for the Department of Public Service to accept additional monies from or return funds to COTA based on final quantities and unit costs, and this ordinance seeks to authorize the same in the absence of additional legislation for that purpose.   \n                  \n2.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with COTA as soon as reasonably practicable to facilitate the acceptance and expenditure of requisite construction funding so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the aforementioned public improvements.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nA separate ordinance authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of City funds to support the construction phase of the Roadway - Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project will be put forth for Council consideration at a later time. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to accept funding from the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) relative to the Roadway - Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project; to authorize, as necessary, either the acceptance of additional monies from COTA for the project or the issuance of a refund of any unspent funds received from COTA after final accounting has been completed; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is administering the Roadway - Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project, which will culminate in the conversion of Front Street between Broad Street and Hickory Street and Marconi Boulevard between Broad Street and Spring Street to two-way operation; and\n \nWHEREAS, COTA has agreed to contribute up to $1,000,000.00 to support the completion of the aforementioned project; and  \n \nWHEREAS, this legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to accept funding from COTA relative to the aforementioned effort; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to execute agreements with COTA as soon as reasonably practicable to facilitate the acceptance and expenditure of requisite construction funding so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the aforementioned public improvements, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n                     \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service hereby is authorized to enter into agreements with and to accept up to $1,000,000.00 from the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) toward work performed as part of the Roadway - Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of Public Service hereby is authorized, as necessary, either to accept additional funds from COTA to support its proportional share of construction costs or to refund the unexpended balance of the funds deposited by COTA after final accounting is complete for the Roadway - Front Street and Marconi Boulevard project or the Department of Public Service, Division of Design and Construction determmines the remaining funds are no longer needed. \n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the mayor, or ten days after passage if the mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
