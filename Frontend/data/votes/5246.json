    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish a purchase order to George Byers Sons, Inc. (PA004790 & PA004948) for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks by the Fleet Management Division for subsequent distribution to various city departments. These vehicles are to be purchased as replacements for older, high mileage, high maintenance and out of life cycle vehicles currently in service. They are more fuel efficient and will relieve the city of maintenance expenses. The current environment for purchasing from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) is unstable and characterized by extremely short order windows. As such, this volatility is requiring a high level of agility in procurement efforts. The previous procurement order of these trucks was unable to be completed before the rollout of the new models for the year. The amount being requested is to provide for the price discrepancy between the models for the fifty seven vehicles being purchased.\n \nGeorge Byers Sons, Inc. vendor#006008, PA004790 & PA004948 - Light Duty Trucks & Police Vehicles - expires 6/30/23\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal Excluded Parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract as per the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance seeks authority to expend $176,083.00 from the Special Income Tax Fund for the acquisition of vehicles. $7.5 million was budgeted collectively in the General Fund and the Special Income Tax Fund for the 2022 Citywide Vehicle Acquisitions. This ordinance is contingent on passage of Ordinance 2318-2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicle order windows to open and close, at random, with little to no notice. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet may secure competitive pricing in light of these on-going supply chain issues.\n \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles for use by the Department of Public Safety, Development, Finance, Public Service and Recreation and Parks with Byers Ford; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $176,083.00 from the Special Income Tax Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($176,083.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Departments have a need to replace older high mileage and high maintenance vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, the replacement of these vehicles will reduce maintenance, service, and fuel-related costs associated with ongoing ownership of older vehicles and is necessary as part of the City's ongoing investment in vehicle assets; and\n \nWHEREAS, George Byers Sons, Inc. successfully bid and was awarded contracts PA004790 - Light Duty Trucks, expires 6/30/23 and PA004948- Police Vehicles, expires 6/30/23; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding for these vehicles is budgeted and available within the Special Income Tax fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Finance & Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to establish this purchase order for the purchase of new vehicles to secure competitive pricing in light of on-going supply chain issues for use by City Departments, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 8.
