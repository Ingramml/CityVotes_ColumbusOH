    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with KNS Services for continued security camera services and equipment. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $75,000.00.\n \nOrdinance 0164-2022 authorized the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with KNS Services for continued security camera services and equipment. Ordinances 1333-2022 and 1699-2022 authorized the modification of this contract for specific locations in need of surveillance upgrades. The original contract, authorized by 0164-2022, included $52,000.00 for weekly operation checks as well as $50,000.00 for new security equipment to replace failing components. It has been determined that additional funds are needed to be available for the purchase of replacement equipment when failures occur or improvements are needed. \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department owns 55 unique surveillance systems comprised of 508 cameras around the City. Failures over the past several months, coupled with escalated costs for equipment, have nearly exhausted the funding for replacement equipment. To ensure we have the necessary funding in place to keep our systems functional for the remainder of this contract cycle, this ordinance provides additional funds needed for future replacement and improvements of surveillance equipment. These equipment purchases are usually not known until urgently needed to keep surveillance fully operational. This ordinance will also provide funding for the addition of a mobile app to the system that will allow staff to view cameras at any of our Genetec Platform sites remotely on their cell phones and other devices. This upgrade to the surveillance system will prove to be invaluable for incident response and to monitor system operations.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nKNS Services, Inc.\n8450 Rausch Drive, Plain City, OH 43064\nNathan Bladen, 614-733-3880\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 005443, 31-1460220\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 8, 2023                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to make this funding immediately available for any equipment replacements or improvements needed as they arise.  These equipment needs are critical surveillance system infrastructure that assists Columbus Police Detectives when incidents occur. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract provides higher reliability of all of our surveillance systems to assist in minimizing crime in our facilities and parks. The mobile app addition to the system will allow easier access by staff, allowing them to keep a closer eye on facilities and system performance issues.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: We receive hundreds of calls from citizens regarding safety in parks every year. This contract will assist in improving the safety of our parks and facilities throughout the system.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving system wide safety and security. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $858,676.00 was legislated for continued security camera services and equipment improvements by Ordinances 0164-2022, 1333-2022, and 1699-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $75,000.00.
