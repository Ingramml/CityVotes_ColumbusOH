    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with GPD Group to provide architectural and engineering services for the Whetstone Field Improvements Project. The contract amount is $224,009.97, with a contingency of $50,990.03, for a total of $275,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThis project involves the preparation of construction documents for grading, drainage, and turf improvements to address ponding of water in the existing sports fields at Whetstone Park. By improving these fields it will allow for the fields to be used as intended with no flooding interruptions or safety concerns during the sports season. Wells and irrigation are also included in the improvements planned for these fields.\n \nGPD Group will also conduct an assessment for the casting pond and adjacent shelter to determine future improvements and renovations. At that time, a determination will be made as to include additional work in this project or to have a separate project to address the needs of the pond and shelter.  \n \nThere is a desire to have this project completed in 2023 so that the fields can be back in use for the 2024 sports seasons as this is a very busy park for programming.  Though a final construction estimate will be created as part of the project, the estimated construction budget is approximately $1,500,000.00 to $2,000,000.00. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 2, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 23, 2022  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nGPD Group (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended GPD Group be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nPrincipal Parties: \nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven DBA GPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210\nColumbus, Ohio 43215 \nAngela Short, Project Manager, (614) 588-8955\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006560, 34-1134715\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 20, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to minimize the impacts to the daily operations of sports programs at Whetstone Community Center and Park. It is the goal of the Department to complete construction in 2023 so that the fields can be used for programming by the time the 2024 sports season starts. It is also the goal of the Department to minimize the time of disturbance to the area under construction for public benefit and use.  This project timeline is extremely sensitive as it relates to the permitting required for work in the floodplain and floodway. Construction must also be complete prior to the 2023 fall planting season. Starting as soon as possible gives the Department the greatest opportunity to achieve these goals. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will improve and provide high quality sports fields for traveling teams and leagues.  Needed improvements have been identified by both staff and the community. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for well-kept and user friendly facilities through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff. The Clintonville Community and traveling soccer teams that utilize these fields have requested grading and drainage improvements to the sports fields due to continual flooding and poor quality of the sports fields. Irrigation is also being added to address the turf conditions of the fields themselves.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Clintonville (39) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to improve the safety standards of these fields and updating five neighborhood parks per year. \n \nFiscal Impact: $275,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with GPD Group to provide architectural and engineering services for the Whetstone Field Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $275,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $275,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
