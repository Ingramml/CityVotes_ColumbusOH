    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Setterlin Building Company for the Frank Fetch Park Improvements Project. The contract amount is $264,105.00, with a contingency of $35,895.00, for a total of $300,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nFrank Fetch Park, a neighborhood park in the heart of German Village, was built in 1962.  This park was originally constructed in the style of a “Bier Garten” with brick paving and brick walls used as a backdrop for the extensive landscaping. The variety of lush plants and large planters are maintained by the German Village Society Garten Club for all residents in Columbus to enjoy. A wood pergola is the focal point of the park and was originally intended for use as a picnic spot. It has also grown to be used a seasonal structure for summer concerts, reunions, and as a wedding venue.  This pergola is in need of replacement prior to it becoming a safety concern for the park users. \n \nThis work includes removal and replacement of the wood pergola that is long past its service life.  The new pergola will provide a metal roof to offer overhead cover from weather as an upgrade to the open canopy that is currently in place.  The work also includes installing conduits for future electrical service to the pergola in a future phase.  \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on September 8, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 29, 2022. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nSetterlin Building Company (MAJ): $264,105.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Setterlin Building Company was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Setterlin Building Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nR W Setterlin Building Company\n560 Harmon Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio 43223\nMark Setterlin, (740) 417-9195, m.setterlin@setterlin.com                               \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 004372, 31-0836188\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 19, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to minimize the impacts to a highly visible, highly used park in the heart of German Village. It is immediately necessary to begin the procurement of roofing and lumber materials so that the project does not interrupt the operation of this park during the peak season, including scheduled events starting in May of 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project includes removing equipment and structures that are badly damaged and at the end of their expected life cycle. Work will include replacing existing materials and equipment, repairing the existing pavement, and electrical connections as needed, making the park safer for everyone using the space.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Needed improvements were identified by both internal staff and from community requests. The community has expressed the desire for well-kept facilities and amenities through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with staff.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: German Village (61)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by participating in partnerships with public and private entities. Frank Fetch Park area originally became a park as a joint effort between the German Village Society to identify the purchase of the property and agreed to assist in the maintenance of the public parkland.  The Society has had continued to partner with the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department through ongoing fundraising efforts for site furnishings and moveable planters.  \n \nWhen the German Village Society Garten Club identified that the pergola was in need of more than maintenance, they conducted a fundraising effort to design and to provide funding to leverage the Department’s capital improvement budget.  The location of the current pergola continues to be used for community events and the improvements have been designed to include a roof overhead and electrical service in the future, providing a more user friendly site for the community.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $300,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund 2223 and Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Setterlin Building Company for the Frank Fetch Park Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $238,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $300,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund and Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
