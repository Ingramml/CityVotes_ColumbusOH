    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department modify an existing contract with Stantec Consulting Services to provide professional services associated with detailed design of the Scioto Trail from Fifth Avenue to Trabue Road. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $236,166.00.\n \nOrdinance 1574-2019 authorized the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Stantec Consulting Services to do a preliminary alignment study of extending the Scioto Trail from Fifth Avenue to Griggs Park. The study involved extensive public involvement, analysis of seven potential trail corridors, preliminary cost estimating, coordination with key regional trail building agencies within the local area, and a phase one inventory of environmental resources. The results produced a preferred alignment for Recreation and Parks to advance into an intended stage two modification for detailed design. The contract modification was planned in 2019 to continue the engineering once the preferred alignment was determined.  Procurement of a separate consultant contract would cost the city additional funds, delays in the project advancement, and would not provide the Department with required cost estimating to apply for grant funding.\n \nThe Scioto Trail is a major regional greenway from the south side of downtown in Berliner Park to Fifth Avenue. This nine miles of open trail is one of the City’s most heavily used paths for cyclists, pedestrians, commuters, runners, and special events.  Plans call for over 27 miles of trail to be completed from the far northwest side of the City through downtown, to the far south side of Columbus near Lockbourne. This key middle section will tie together regional trail partners such as Hilliard, Upper Arlington, Metro Parks, Upper Arlington, and Marble Cliff. Over 8,000 residents live within a 10 minute walk of this proposed segment. Over 350,000 residents from around the larger area will begin to be connected to downtown, Quarry Trails Metro Park, and the entire 130 mile regional Central Ohio Greenways network.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nStantec Consulting Services Inc.\n1500 Lake Shore Drive Suite 100\nColumbus, Ohio 43204\nBrian Hagerty, (614)485-8352\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 000462, 11-2167170\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 28, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the Department will need to have the consultant team provide a certified cost estimate by January 25, 2023 as a necessary requirement to apply for state grant funding for the project.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project ties together several years of regional collaboration between public and private trail building partnerships and the public at large with the goals of creating recreational opportunities, as well as providing a car-free means of active transportation. This project will provide connections to parks, downtown, employment centers, retail, entertainment, cultural events, and other destinations.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Several planning documents and studies show extensive benefits and public demand for trail connectivity for the larger northwest corridor of Columbus. The current end of the trail at Fifth Avenue limits thousands of residents from safe access to the trail system. Development of new housing, attractions, and parks within this trail section is moving ahead rapidly.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors while improving the environmental health of the City’s waterways. This project will also improve recreational access to streams and provide long term protection corridors for water quality and trail development.  \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $ $169,500.00 was legislated for the Scioto Trail Extension Project by Ordinance 1574-2019. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $236,166.00. $236,166.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $405,666.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Stantec Consulting Services to provide professional services associated with detailed design of the Scioto Trail from Fifth Avenue to Trabue Road; to authorize the transfer of $236,166.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $236,166.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
