    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $825,000.00 for the purchase of equipment and vehicles for the Recreation and Parks Department. These purchases will be made through the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. \n \nThe City of Columbus Purchasing Office previously obtained bids and awarded contracts for the purchase of equipment and vehicles in compliance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  They were authorized by prior Ordinances 0924-2021, 0722-2022, and 1331-2022.  They all authorized the purchase of equipment and vehicles, encumbering funds on Auditor’s Certificates totaling $5,168,656.00, based on estimated expenditures for those purchases. A number of supply chain issues and economic factors have caused increased costs for distributors and longer lead times for delivery. The actual bids and awards have exceeded the amount of funding authorized from those prior ordinances. Based on actual and pending awards, there is a need for an estimated $600,000.00 to enter into the remaining contracts for all equipment specified in prior ordinances listed above.\n \nFurthermore, the Purchasing Office recognizes the need to identify contingency funding and/or modify contracts to pay for cost increases if and when the awarded vendor requests additional funding and can provide the required documentation to the Purchasing Office to justify the requested price increase after award. The awarded vendor must demonstrate that the request for price increase to the City and subsequent contract modification is directly attributed to unforeseen acquisition cost increases from the manufacturer or distributor at some point in time between entering into contract with the City and before delivering the equipment to the City.  Acceptable documentation must include cost estimates or quotes at the time of procurement and new cost estimates or quotes. Actual acquisition costs from the manufacturer or distributor at time of purchase can also be used as acceptable documentation. $225,000.00 is requested for contingency funding to modify contracts as needed in the future. The contingency funding represents approximately 5% of contract pricing for all equipment listed in the previous ordinances noted above and that is still pending award and/or delivery. \n \nIt may be necessary to increase costs for the previously authorized contracts rather than pursue new procurement to ensure timely delivery of equipment.  Additional delays in procurement would lead to delays in delivery from manufacturers or distributors and will likely lead to increase costs for the City.  Recreation and Parks has an immediate need to provide equipment for staff to maintain City facilities, parks, and trees. This ordinance will authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify all contracts authorized by the previous ordinances mentioned in order to purchase of equipment on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department. The City is experiencing extremely long lead times for the delivery of equipment, vehicles, and parts and this ordinance will allow these purchases to be completed in the most efficient manner possible. \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to have equipment and vehicles delivered and available as soon as possible in order to allow the Recreation and Parks Department to continue performing necessary work. The duties supported by this equipment and vehicles has been greatly impacted by delays in the delivery of new equipment and vehicles caused by the global supply chain issues. This ordinance is establishing the funding required for the equipment and vehicles being purchased. Equipment will be ordered immediately upon the approval of this ordinance and resulting purchase orders. The City is seeing extremely long lead times on most equipment and vehicles. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Trees, parkland, sports fields, and golf courses maintained by the city enhance the quality of life of our citizens. The equipment will allow for the continued upkeep of these amenities.\n \nCommunity Input Issues: The community has expressed a desire for accessible and well-maintained parkland, facilities, golf courses, and sports fields. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This Auditor’s Certificate and resulting purchases support the Department’s Master Plan by helping to ensure that trees, facilities, golf courses, sports fields, and parks remain accessible, safe, updated, user friendly, and well maintained. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $5,168,656.00 was legislated for the purchase of equipment and vehicles by Ordinances 0924-2021, 0722-2022, and 1331-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $825,000.00. The aggregate total amount authorized for the purchase of equipment and vehicles by these ordinances is $5,993,656.00. $825,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 and Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of these various expenditures.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $825,000.00 for the purchase of equipment and vehicles for the Recreation and Parks Department; to authorize the increase of $825,000.00 to the total amount authorized for the purchase of equipment and vehicles authorized by Ordinances 0924-2021, 0722-2022, and 1331-2022; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify contracts as needed for the purchase of equipment on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department detailed in Ordinances 0924-2021, 0722-2022, and 1331-2022; to authorize the appropriation of $223,350.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the transfer of $600,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund; to authorize the transfer of $223,350.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $825,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund and Permanent Improvement Fund; and to declare an emergency.
