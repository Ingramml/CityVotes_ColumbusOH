($62,601.52)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Gable Elevator for elevator maintenance services for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD). DOSD facilities served by the contract are the Sewer Maintenance Operations Center and Southerly and Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plants. Other department facilities may be added in the future. \n \nThe work under this contract mainly concerns the servicing of elevators and their associated equipment and systems that require inspection, testing, troubleshooting, maintenance, and repair or replacement of failed components. The work may also include software updates for the various units and their associated equipment.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU) solicited competitive bids for the services in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code. RFSQ023154 was opened on November 16, 2022 and two (2) bids were received, one of which was considered non-responsive. Gable Elevator was determined to be the lowest, responsible and responsive bidder and thus recommended to receive the contract award.\n \nThe contract was bid as a one (1) year contract with the option for three (3) additional years. These would be executed as annual renewals and contingent upon mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds, and approval of City Council. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that require additional funding, a modification would be requested. This ordinance is for the first year of the contract, which is expected to go into effect in January of 2023. If all renewals are executed, the agreement would expire in January of 2027.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nGable Elevator | Federal EIN 84-3785881 | D365 Vendor #043609 | Expires 11/9/2024 | Gable Elevator does not hold MBE/WBE status.  \n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$60,000.00 was budgeted for elevator maintenance services. There is enough surplus in both object classes 02, Materials and Supplies, and 03, Services, to cover the overage.  \n \n$0 was spent in 2021\n$0 was spent in 2020\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to avoid a lapse in critical elevator maintenance services at various DPU, DOSD facilities. The requisite services were newly bid out this year, however, due to timing, passage of a non-emergency ordinance would result in a gap between the end of the prior elevator maintenance services contract and this one.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Gable Elevator for elevator maintenance services at various Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage facilities; to authorize the expenditure of $62,601.52 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund; and to declare an emergency.
