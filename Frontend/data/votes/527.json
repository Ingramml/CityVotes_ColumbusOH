    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  The Columbus Department of Development is proposing a Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with OFFOR Health, Inc. dba SmileMD.\n \nFounded in 2014, and headquartered in Central Ohio, OFFOR Health, Inc. dba SmileMD (“SmileMD”) is a healthcare company that brings mobile anesthesia services for in-office surgical procedures. Specifically, the company brings an anesthesiologist and full care team to primarily pediatric dental offices to provide anesthesia services for their surgical procedures. Having these procedures done in small offices rather than larger facilities saves the providers and patients potentially thousands of dollars in medical bills and removes a bottleneck for services. Services areas presently include Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky. New service areas will be in contiguous states coming online later this year and are the catalyst for the new employee growth.\n \nSmileMD is proposing to invest a total project cost of approximately $45,000 including $40,000 in machinery and equipment and $5,000 in leasehold improvements to build out their corporate headquarters and renovate an approximately 9,195 square-foot office space at 1103 Schrock Road, Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43229, parcel number 610-184216 (“Project Site”), to accommodate its increased sales growth and to meet its consumer demands.
