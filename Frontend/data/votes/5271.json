Additionally, they offer supportive services and programming that can help Tenant live independently and with dignity, and further have agreed to provide supportive services and programming to any Eligible Tenant at the development.

This can also include rent and utility assistance, career training programs that offer accredited credentials in the skilled trades, or licensing or certifications in healthcare, technology fields and more.\n \nThese bond funds will be used to pay for expenses incurred prior to purchase order approval for infrastructure work such as alley and right-of way-work.\n \nEmergency action is requested to maintain the schedule of the project and to mitigate construction cost increases.\n \nFISCAL IMPACTS\nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $330,000.00 in the Affordable Housing Bond Fund. It is necessary to certify the requisite funds in the amount of $330,000.00 against the Special Income Tax Fund. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 043178 and expires 09/30/24.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Special Income Tax to the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $330,000.00 with Olde Towne Investors LLC for the Triumph Apartments development; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $330,000.00 within the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the approval of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
