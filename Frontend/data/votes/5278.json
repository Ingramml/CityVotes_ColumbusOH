    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes an amendment to Ordinance 2519-2022, passed on September 19, 2022, to allow for Columbus City Council approval to reimburse for food under the terms of the contract.\n \nOrdinance 2519-2022 authorized a Not-for-Profit Service Contract with the Community Shelter Board for the Transitional Housing Pilot Program. The goal of the program is to recognize the natural communities developed within our unsheltered population and move them into a more stable, and sheltered environment, as a community.  The program would also provide food for clients.  An additional aim for this program is to launch a transitional housing pilot that can serve as a benchmark as CSB creates a perpetual transitional housing program for the community.  \n \nAs Ordinance 2519-2022 was being drafted, the request of Council’s approval to reimburse for food expenses was inadvertently left out of the ordinance.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to execute the contract this year to implement the program.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  None\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The contract compliance number for Community Shelter Board is 004795 and expires on 01/10/2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 2519-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on September 19, 2022, to permit reimbursement of food expenses under the terms of the Not-for-Profit Service Contract with the Community Shelter Board for the Transitional Housing Pilot Program; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, ordinance 2519-2022 authorized a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB), to operate the Transitional Housing Pilot Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance authorizes and amendment of the original legislation allowing CSB to be reimbursed for all associated costs of under the terms of the contract, including food provided to clients; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to amend the ordinance in order to allow for the execution of the contract by the Director this year so that the program benefiting the homeless may be implemented prior to the winter; now, therefore,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Section 1 of Ordinance No. 2519-2022, passed on September 19, 2022, be amended to read as follows:  “SECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $300,000.00 for the Transitional Housing Pilot Program and to permit reimbursement of all associated costs under the terms of the contract, including food provided to clients.  This one-year contract will commence on September 12, 2022.”    \n \nSECTION 2. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
