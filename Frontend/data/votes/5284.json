    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This legislation authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $590,000 to support winter warming centers that will help keep unhoused individuals safe during dangerous weather.  Services and plans will cover the following three components:\n \nDaytime Warming Centers\nUnhoused residents will be able to utilize libraries, recreation centers, and a handful of churches to stay warm during the day this winter. An online interactive map will help individuals locate the various warming centers across the city. This map will outline the hours of operation and any additional services that will be provided on site.  Homeless outreach teams will focus their engagement high traffic locations, working to enroll unhoused residents in street outreach if they are interested and help develop a housing plan with them.  This online map will be developed into a hot card that can be available at public buildings and for nonprofit partners. The Coalition for the Homeless and Community Development for All People (CD4AP) - two key partners in this effort - will host 2 “hub” locations with additional resources, services, and dedicated staff.  \n \nOvernight Shelter\nEach year, Community Shelter Board develops a plan to handle winter overflow. Due to a tight housing market and reduced outflow from the shelters, it is worthwhile to provide residents additional choices during the winter months. The Coalition for the Homeless and CD4AP are seeking to operate overnight warming centers from the start of December to the end of February to augment the shelter spaces available for unhoused residents.\n \nExtreme Cold Events\nDuring level 3 snow emergencies, shelters keep individuals inside and remain open all day. Additionally, homeless outreach teams conduct specific, concentrated engagement in an attempt to get individuals inside ahead of extreme weather events. The Coalition’s two 24 hour sites would continue operating as normal. CRPD Community Recreation Centers will open five regional Community Recreation Centers and will extend operating hours, 9:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. to accommodate those who need a warm place in extreme cold (below 0 degrees).\n \nExpenses to support the three components include but are not limited to staff salaries and benefits, facility rentals and security, food for individuals at the facilities, COTA passes, and administrative costs.  It is estimated that approximately $130,000 of the funds will be used to provide meals to individuals at the various warming facilities.\n \nThese services cannot be provided by existing city employees as they do not have the resources to perform the program services\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow Community Shelter Board to provide warming services to unhoused individuals as the temperatures are dropping in the winter months.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding of $295,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund (100018) and funding of $295,000.00 is available and will be transferred from the General Fund Citywide Account to the Department of Development General Fund. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 004795 and expires on 01/10/24.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service agreement with Community Shelter Board in an amount up to $590,000.00 for the purpose of supporting winter warming services; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $295,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund; to authorize the transfer of $295,000.00 from the General Fund Citywide Account to the Department of Development General Fund Budget; to authorize the total expenditure of $590,000.00 from the 2022 General Fund Budget; to authorize the reimbursement of expenditures incurred prior the approval of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
