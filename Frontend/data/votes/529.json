    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: The City will enter into a grant agreement with Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (“CFCFA”) in the amount of $2,000,000.00 in order to provide gap financing for urban redevelopment projects within the City of Columbus.\nThe CFCFA program will provide funding for projects within the urban core and adjacent neighborhoods within the City in order to facilitate projects that will assist in the revitalization of properties and the urban core of the city as a whole.  The long term goal of this fund is to enable the CFCFA to help fill funding gaps for the redevelopment of smaller scale projects in traditional neighborhood corridors.

This fund will allow CFCFA to provide flexible funding to fill these cost gaps for targeted projects in the City.\nFiscal Impact: This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of $2,000,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development Fund 2237.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 009436 and is valid until 5/16/21.\nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is required to allow for immediate execution of the grant agreement, which is necessary to facilitate the execution of the contract so that CFCFA is able to issue funding for urban redevelopment projects.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to provide funding for urban redevelopment projects; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $2,000,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development Fund; and to declare an emergency ($2,000,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary for the City to enter into a grant agreement in the amount of $2,000,000.00 with CFCFA in order to provide gap financing for urban redevelopment projects within the City of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, CFCFA will provide funding for projects in the urban core and adjacent neighborhoods; and\n \nWHEREAS, CFCFA will work directly with the City in order to determine project eligibility; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into the grant agreement to maintain the established program timeline, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to enter into the grant agreement in the amount of $2,000,000.00 with Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to provide funding for urban redevelopment projects.\nSECTION 2.
