    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City of Columbus, Department of Public Safety, received three years of Overdose Data to Action funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via a sub award from Franklin County Public Health (FCPH). This sub award addresses the local opioid crisis by supporting the Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT) and increasing linkage to RREACT outreach and education services. This ordinance accepts and appropriates year one project funds totaling $489,020.93.  The 2022 award budget period is September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023. This ordinance authorizes an appropriation of funds upon receipt of annual executed agreements.\n \nRapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT) is an innovative outreach effort addressing the opioid crisis ravaging Columbus, Ohio. RREACT team members go out into the community and do face-to-face follow up visits with substance users revived from opioid overdose by police or fire first responders who then refuse immediate transport to clinical facilities thereby bypassing treatment and recovery resources available through emergency rooms across the city. RREACT connects with survivors in their neighborhoods within 48 hours of overdose. The team includes a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trained peace officer, a paramedic, a social worker and a trauma specialist.  The goal of this multi-disciplinary outreach team is to help stabilize the household in an effort to reduce barriers to accessing drug and/or behavioral treatment for the substance user. \nCDC funding will continue mobile crisis response by providing outreach in high-risk areas of Columbus, in addition to continuing direct outreach services.  RREACT leadership will continue to bolster relationships with suburban law enforcement teams to gain countywide buy-in for adopting naloxone/NARCAN© administration as standard protocol for opioid overdose incidents.  \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay program services and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $489,020.93 in year one U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention award monies from Franklin County Public Health to fund RREACT outreach activities. This initiative does not generate any revenue nor require a City match.  Sub recipient Agreement Number: CDCOD2A (this is a federal award administered as a sub award via Franklin County Public Health).\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Public Safety Director to accept U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Overdose Data to Action program funding via a sub award from Franklin County Public Health (FCPH); to appropriate award funds to Columbus Public Safety for the Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team outreach activities; to authorize the appropriation of $489,020.93 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund 2220; and to declare an emergency. ($489,020.93)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Franklin County Public Health sub awarded the City of Columbus $489,020.93 in federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funds for the first year of this grant for the Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT) outreach services to high-risk, under served areas within Franklin County; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate CDC funds from Franklin County Public Health to support the RREACT outreach activities; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City desires to accept said project award; and\n \nWHEREAS, the year one contract period with FCPH is September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023, and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to accept the award and appropriate award funds so services may commence and financial transactions can be posted in the City’s accounting system given the project start date of September 1, 2022, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
