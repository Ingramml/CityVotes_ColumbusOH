    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify Agreement PO-209875 with the YMCA of Central Ohio by extending the Agreement termination date from January 31, 2021 to March 31, 2021. This extension will allow the YMCA of Central Ohio to fully complete emergency shelter repairs at the Van Buren Emergency Shelter. \n \nOne of the impacts of COVID-19 was the quarantine period in which the YMCA could not get a company in the building to work. The YMCA decided to utilize existing staff however that staff was then redirected to open an expansion shelter for social distancing. During this time, the YMCA obtained a new vendor and the work began in late fall 2020. Currently repairs are in progress and approximately 90% complete. This legislation would modify the Agreement authorized by Ordinance No. 2819-2019.\n \nEmergency action is requested so repair activities can continue and be completed without further delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are needed for this modification.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the emergency shelter repair agreement with the YMCA of Central Ohio by extending the Agreement (PO-209875) termination date to March 31, 2021; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to modify Agreement PO-209875 with the YMCA of Central Ohio by extending the Agreement termination date from January 31, 2021 to March 31, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification supports the purpose of the YMCA of Central Ohio fully completing emergency shelter repairs at the Van Buren Emergency Shelter; and\n \nWHEREAS, no additional funds are needed to modify this agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify the agreement with the YMCA of Central Ohio so repair activities can continue and be completed without further delay, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify the Agreement, PO-209875, with the YMCA of Central Ohio by extending the termination date from January 31, 2021 to March 31, 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to Agreement modifications.  \n \nSECTION 3.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
