    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The Department of Development anticipates entering into multiple contracts in the future in an amount totaling up to $675,000.00 to implement the Accelerate Columbus: Scale Up and Grow program targeting small businesses.  \nIn 2019, the City of Columbus launched Accelerate Columbus Small Business as part of a branded set of small business training, technical assistance, mentoring, and advisement programs targeting aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners. Initially offered as a pilot program, the goal of the program was to provide structured as well as on-demand training, one-on-one advisement, and technical assistance to both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs and small businesses.\nDuring the pilot year, the City selected and contracted with two organizations to administer the program on behalf of the City. The consultants administered the program in both classroom and small group settings over two tracts targeting businesses at particular stages of the business lifecycle. Accelerate Columbus: Start-Up and Launch targeted individuals in the exploration, ideation, and pre-revenue business lifecycle stages and Accelerate Columbus: Scale Up and Grow targeted those businesses in a revenue-generating posture and who were uniquely positioned for growth.\nBy way of this ordinance, the director seeks to encumber the planned funds from the 2022 operating budget for multiple contracts for the services mentioned above with to-be-determined firms.  The department is currently engaged in the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, but the process will not be completed before City Council’s last meeting in 2022. It is estimated that the contracts with the selected vendors will be legislated and executed in January 2023.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in to order to encumber the funds before the end of the fiscal year.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $675,000.00 is planned and available within the Economic Development Division’s General Fund budget.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to encumber funds for anticipated contracts totaling an amount up to $675,000.00 with to-be-determined firms to implement the Accelerate Columbus: Scale Up and Grow program targeting small businesses; to authorize the expenditure of up to $675,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($675,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development anticipates entering into multiple contracts to implement the Accelerate Columbus: Scale Up and Grow program targeting small businesses; and\n \nWHEREAS, the department is currently engaged in  the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, and the process will not be completed, nor legislation ready, before City Council’s last meeting in 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, by way of this ordinance, the director seeks to encumber the planned funds from the 2022 operating budget for the services mentioned above with to-be-determined firms in an amount up to $675,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to encumber the funds before the end of the fiscal year, such immediate action is necessary for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
