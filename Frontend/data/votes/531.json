    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to establish an encumbrance within the Special Income Tax Fund to pay 2021 waste disposal tipping fees for the Division of Refuse Collection and to expend funds to pay the tipping fees.  This expense is necessary to safely and contractually dispose of the waste collected by the division in the course of pursuing its mission by providing residential refuse collection services to over 320,000 households weekly, picking up bulk items and illegally dumped items as needed, and to provide radiation remediation services to process quarantined loads at SWACO tipping sites.\n \nThe Department of Public Service has determined that $17,391,000.00 should be adequate for this purpose.  This number is based upon an estimated waste stream of 327,000 tons in 2021.  Actual tonnage is ultimately dependent on variables such as the weather, the actual number of households collected that cannot be specifically calculated at this time, and the unknown amount of bulk and illegally dumped items.  If necessary, additional legislation will be submitted to increase funds at a later date.  \n \nSWACO tipping fee rates are determined by SWACO's established rate-setting process.  Due to an existing contractual relationship where the City of Columbus participates in the rate-setting process, the City is required to use SWACO waste disposal services.  The vendors and waste disposal fees for tire disposal services and construction/demolition material disposal services, will be determined through the city's competitive bidding process. The existing contract for radiation remediation was created using a competitive bidding process and resulted in a one-year contract with the option of renewing for three additional years. The Department of Public service would like to extend this contract utilizing year two. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis expense is budgeted and available within the Special Income Tax Fund. \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to avoid delays of payment to SWACO that could result in the city incurring interest penalties as specified within the contract.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the expenditure of $17,391,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary from the Special Income Tax Fund to pay 2021 waste disposal tipping fees, tire disposal,  construction debris disposal and radiation remediation services for the Division of Refuse Collection; to authorize the Director of Public Service to establish an encumbrance of $17,331,000.00 to pay refuse tipping fees to the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio for the Division of Refuse Collection pursuant to an existing lease agreement; to authorize the Director of Public Service to modify and extend a radiation and remediation service contract with Solutient Technologies Inc.; to establish encumbrances up to $10,000.00 for tire disposal and construction debris material disposal; to establish an encumbrance up to $50,000.00 for a radiation remediation services contract with Solutient Technologies Inc.; and to declare an emergency.  ($17,391,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Division of Refuse Collection must encumber funds to continue refuse tipping at the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO) facilities, pursuant to the lease agreement between the City and SWACO for those facilities, and must encumber funds for disposal of tires, construction/demolition material disposal, and radiation remediation services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service has determined that $17,391,000.00 should be adequate for this purpose and is based upon an estimated waste stream of 327,000 tons in 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, actual tonnage is ultimately dependent on variables such as the weather, the actual number of households collected that cannot be specifically calculated at this time, and the unknown amount of bulk and illegally dumped items; and\n \nWHEREAS, if necessary, additional legislation will be submitted to increase funds at a later date; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the vendors and waste disposal fees for tire disposal services, construction/demolition material disposal services will be determined through the city's competitive bidding process; and\n \nWHEREAS, the existing contract with Solutient Technologies Inc. for radiation remediation services must be modified and extended; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Refuse Collection, Department of Public Service, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to establish an encumbering document with the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio for 2021 refuse disposal services to avoid incurring interest penalties due to late payments, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to establish an encumbrance of $17,331,000.00 with SWACO for 2021 refuse tipping services for the Division of Refuse Collection at the various rate charges assigned to each tipping location and any legal subsequently adjusted rates; and to establish an encumbrance of $10,000.00 for disposal of tires and construction/demolition material; and to establish an encumbrance of $50,000.00 for radiation remediation services contract renewal with Solutient Technologies Inc.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $17,391,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 4430 (Special Income Tax Fund) in Object Class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \nSECTION 3.  That, due to an existing contractual relationship where the City of Columbus participates in the rate-setting process, the City is required to use SWACO waste disposal services.
