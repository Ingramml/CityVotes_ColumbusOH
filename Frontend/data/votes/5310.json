A bidding waiver is requested to award a contract to Lake Erie Construction Company and Rocal Inc. to upgrade or replace existing highway signs to maintain the safety of the traveling public on Columbus highways.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Lake Erie Construction Company or Rocal Inc.\n \n2.

The contract compliance number for Rocal Inc. is CC004186 and the vendor is in the process of completing the contract compliance questionnaire.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this project is available in Fund 2265, the Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair Fund, in an amount of up to $90,000.00.  \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThese expenditures are being made for services utilizing waiving the competitive bid process and as such do not require MWBE goals to be established.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow ODOT to maintain the highway signage upgrading schedule and to promote highway safety. \n \nTitle\nTo waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with Lake Erie Construction Company and Rocal Inc. relative to highway signage replacement services; to authorize the expenditure of up to $90,000.00 from the Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair Fund for services; and to declare an emergency.  ($90,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, existing highway signs are in need of upgrading to maintain safety on Columbus highways; and \n \nWHEREAS, these improvements are located within the Columbus corporate boundaries; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code, enter into a contract with Lake Erie Construction Company and Rocal Inc. in the amount of up to $90,000.00 relative to highway signage replacement services to accommodate an accelerated schedule due to specific material failure and scheduling needs; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds for highway signage replacement services; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to expend these funds so as to allow Lake Erie Construction Company and Rocal Inc. to upgrade or replace existing highway signs to promote highway safety, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to enter into agreements with Lake Erie Construction Company located at 25 S.
