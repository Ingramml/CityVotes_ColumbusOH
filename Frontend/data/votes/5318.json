    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC for The Columbus Renaissance Housing development.  \nThe Columbus Renaissance Housing development is intended to be structured as a partnership organized strategically to pair a local place-based neighborhood nonprofit entities, Community Development for All People (“CD4AP”) with Woda Cooper Companies, Inc. (\"Woda\"), a highly experienced nationwide developer who will serve as general contractor and property manager.\nColumbus Renaissance Housing is located at 33 West Morrill Avenue in Merion Village.  The project is a single-phase development to occur on multi parcel former industrial manufacturing site that is bounded by existing housing on two adjacent sides, a church, and the Salvation Army, and is just a short distance outside of the central downtown core.  \nThe property will feature affordable workforce housing with all units at 60% AMI. The project will be geared toward a variety of residents: young professionals, single-parent households, small families and even seniors. The combined project will foster services to support families, aging-in-place, and workforce housing concepts. Amenities on-site will include management offices, a health and wellness center, community rooms, and more. The project is within steps of COTA bus stops, the Berliner Sports Park, several restaurants, houses of worship, Salvation Army, and the highly-rated Southwood Elementary School.\nIn addition to the myriad of supportive services and programming opportunities directly offered through Community Development For All People, the development will also engage with other local partners to expand future programming to be offered to all family households, single parents, seniors or anyone residing at the Columbus Renaissance Housing.\nThe building will include nine (12) one-bedroom units, twenty-eight (28) two bedroom units and six (6) three-bedroom units. All apartments will have at least one (1) full bathroom; the three-bedroom units may have 1.5 bathrooms, pending final project design and budgeting. Over 10% of the project units will be fully accessible and at least three (3) additional units for hearing/vision impaired residents. All of the units will be “Visit-Able” with a zero-step entrance and widths/clearances acceptable to accommodating residents and visitors with wheelchairs, walkers and other mobility-assisting devices, as well as feature elements of Universal Design promoting “aging in place.”\n \nThe original ordinance 2049-2022 passed on July 25, 2022 allowed for the establishment of a Housing Development Agreement to utilize Affordable Housing bond funds coming from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget in the amount of $1,400,000.00.  This ordinance will allow for the establishment of $1,900,000.00 from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget through a bond agreement funded temporarily with the Special Income Tax Fund until bonds are issued, with a Housing Development Agreement no longer needed.\n \nEmergency action is requested to maintain the permit and closing schedule of the project and to mitigate construction cost increases.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACTS\nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $1,900,000.00 in the Affordable Housing Bond Fund. It is necessary to certify the requisite funds in the amount of $1,900,000.00 against the Special Income Tax Fund. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033062 and expires 06/24/24.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2022 Capital Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Special Income Tax to the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $1,900,000.00 with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC for The Columbus Renaissance Housing development; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $1,900,000.00 within the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
