    "description": "Explanation\n \n BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC for the Starling Yard project.  \nStarling Yard will occur on the former school site located at 120 South Central Avenue. The property contains the historic 1908 Starling School (originally built as West High School), and is bounded on its perimeter by existing housing (north, east, and south), as well as the new Starling Middle School, West Central School and existing senior apartments to the west. The site is walkable to the West Broad Street corridor, which contains a number of restaurants and retail stores. The Franklinton Branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library and City of Columbus Fire Station and EMS Station 10 are just a short distance away. When completed, the project will deliver new high-quality infill development with important safe and accessible affordable units needed by families, redevelop a vacant historic structure as additional affordable housing units while at the same time returning the building to its more appropriate 1908 configuration, and provide housing in an undeserved underserved area of the City of Columbus.\nStarling Yard will contain 18 one-bedroom units, 26 two-bedroom units, and 8 three- bedroom units. The property will be mixed-income, featuring affordable housing ranging from 30% AMI, up to 80% AMI, accommodating various household sizes. 20 units will be set-aside for residents earning at or below 30% AMI, 24 units will be set-aside for residents earning at or below 50% AMI, 11 units will be set-aside for residents earning 60% AMI, and 42 units will be set-aside for residents earning 80% AMI. The project will be appropriate for a variety of populations: singles, young professionals, seniors, single-parent households, small families needing three-bedroom units, and those needing workforce housing in close proximity to downtown and surrounding job centers. The project intends to have no fewer than 10% of the units be fully accessible, ideal for people with housing entry barriers including elderly, persons with mobility disabilities, and those less mobile. Additional units will be set-aside for hearing/vision impaired residents. \nOn-site amenities will include management offices, community room, and more. The project is less than 100' of COTA bus stops, and quality retail including United Dairy Farms store, Bottoms Up Coffee, several restaurants, houses of worship, Jubilee Market Grocery, and Lower Lights Pharmacy. Programming opportunities will be offered through Franklinton Development Association.\n \nThe original ordinance 2041-2022 passed on July 25, 2022 allowed for the establishment of a Housing Development Agreement to utilize Affordable Housing bond funds coming from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget in the amount of $3,000,000.00.  Since that time, there have been construction cost increases and the request has increased to $3,500,000.00.  This ordinance will allow for the establishment of $3,500,000.00 from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget through a bond agreement funded temporarily with the Special Income Tax Fund until bonds are issued, with a Housing Development Agreement no longer needed.\n \nEmergency action is requested LLC to maintain the permit and closing schedule of the project and to mitigate construction cost increases.\n \nFISCAL IMPACTS\nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $3,500,000.00 in the Affordable Housing Bond Fund. It is necessary to certify the requisite funds in the amount of $3,500,000.00 against the Special Income Tax Fund. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033062 and expires 06/24/24\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Special Income Tax to the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $3,500,000.00 with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC for the Starling Yard project; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $3,500,000.00 within the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
