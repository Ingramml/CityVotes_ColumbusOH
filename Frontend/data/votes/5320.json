    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project.  \nMcKinley Manor is a single-phase development to occur on a multi-parcel former commercial site that is bounded by existing housing on two adjacent sides, the City of Columbus Fire Station and EMS Station 10. The project is within steps of COTA bus stops, a United Dairy Farms store, Bottoms Up Coffee, several restaurants, houses of worship, Jubilee Market Grocery, and Lower Lights Pharmacy.\nThe property will be mixed-income, featuring low income age-restricted senior housing accommodating senior households (55+) with incomes ranging from 60% AMI and below. The project also intends to have all forty four (44) one-bedroom, housing units with Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance to target housing needs in the community for housing people with multiple entry barriers including elderly, persons with disabilities, chronically mentally ill, and homeless individuals and families.\nMcKinley Manor is working with the YMCA to receive their Permanent Supportive Housing funds from the downtown YMCA, with a commitment that McKinley Manor will take the qualified tenants from the downtown YMCA location.  Lifecare Alliance is providing the transportation needed to make this possible. \nAll apartments will have at least one (1) full bathroom. Over 5% of the project units will be fully accessible and at least one (1) unit for hearing/vision impaired residents. All of the units will be “Visit-Able” with a zero-step entrance and widths/clearances acceptable to accommodating residents and visitors with wheelchairs, walkers and other mobility-assisting devices, as well as feature elements of Universal Design promoting “aging in place.”\nThe McKinley Manor project will provide select specialized coordination of supportive support and especially to seniors to enhance residents’ ability to maintain independence and tenancy. The site amenities will include a campus setting with adequate lighting and parking, main entry driveway access, community recreation areas and garden -style units. The building amenities include elevator, common laundry, on-site property management and tenant service coordinator offices, ample tenant storage, men’s and women’s rest rooms and even an exercise room.\n \nThe original ordinance 1770-2022 passed on July 11, 2022 allowed for the establishment of a Housing Development Agreement to utilize Affordable Housing bond funds coming from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget in the amount of $1,250,000.00.  That Housing Development Agreement was closed on August 11, 2022.  This ordinance will allow for the commitment and expenditure of that $1,250,000.00 from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget through a bond agreement funded temporarily with the Special Income Tax Fund until bonds are issued.\n \nEmergency action is requested to maintain the developer’s draw schedule.\n \nFISCAL IMPACTS\nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $1,250,000.00 in the Affordable Housing Bond Fund. It is necessary to certify the requisite funds in the amount of $1,250,000.00 against the Special Income Tax Fund. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006216 and expires 10/22/23.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Special Income Tax to the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $1,250,000.00 with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the McKinley Manor Apartments project; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $1,250,000.00 within the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
