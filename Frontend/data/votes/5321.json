    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n The Franklin County Municipal Court is the busiest court in the state of Ohio. It continually strives to improve services to every litigant who appears before the Court and strives to be a wise and efficient steward of taxpayer resources. To this end, the Court charges a variety of court fees to provide additional support to the administration of its departments and programs.\nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $4,715,560 for fiscal year 2023 within the following Franklin County Municipal Court Special Funds: \nIDAT Fund - provide sufficient funds to pay the cost of attendance at court-ordered drug and alcohol treatment centers.  The Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services (ADAMH) Board administers the indigent driver alcohol treatment program of the Court, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code 4511.191(N).  \nSecurity Fund - provide funds to pay the cost of staff, supplies, and services to promote the mission and support the security department efforts.\nDispute Resolution Fund - The Franklin County Municipal Court instituted its pre-filing mediation program for small claims cases in 1984; the program provides mediation services for individuals and businesses who wish to resolve their disputes and avoid filing a small claims case.\nHome Incarceration Fund - provide sufficient funds to pay the cost of electronic monitoring and state charged work release of probationers.\nSpecialized Dockets Fund - The Specialized Dockets consist of five programs which address drug and alcohol addiction, heroin addiction, mental health issues, and the special needs of human trafficking victims and veterans:  The Solicitation Program (CATCH), Mental Health Program (LINC), Military and Veterans Program (MAVS), and the Addiction Programs (HART and RECOVERY COURT).  Each docket has received certification after submitting written materials and undergoing a site review to ensure that statewide, minimum standards are met.  The Specialized Dockets hold criminal offenders accountable while linking them with comprehensive treatment and services, which leads to a reduction in recidivism and an increase in community safety.\n \nSelf Help Assisted Civil Fund - The program began in January 2016.  The program provides information about the court system and non-legal assistance to civil litigants qualifying as indigent and appearing pro se before the Court.  \n \nProbation Fund - These funds are collected as a one-time probation supervision fee for all individuals placed under probation supervision by the Court effective December 1, 1995.  The collection of said funds was authorized by Amended Substitute House Bill Number 406, signed into law in August, 1994.  The intent of these funds is to provide for specialized probation staff, the purchase of needed equipment, services, and other similar probation-related expenses not currently available to the Court's probation services department.\n \nIDIAM Fund - to provide sufficient funds to pay the cost of attendance at court-ordered treatment centers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There are sufficient funds available within the above listed funds to support the requested appropriation level for 2023.\n \nEMERGENCY:  An emergency is being requested so that funds can be established at the start of the 2023 budget year.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $4,715,560.00 from the 2023 unappropriated balance of the Franklin County Municipal Court Special Funds to the Franklin County Municipal Court, for all anticipated expenses;
