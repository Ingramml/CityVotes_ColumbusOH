    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThe City of Columbus, Columbus Public Health, receives funding for the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio Grant Program from the Ohio Department of Health. The purpose of this grant is to create “Disruptive Innovation” by seeking to prevent new HIV infections by focusing on four (4) pillars:  treating HIV to achieve viral suppression, diagnose HIV so that all persons know their HIV status, prevent infections through PrEP and syringe support programs, and respond to HIV clusters or outbreaks within the community.  This grant specifically focuses on the diagnose and prevent pillars.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a contract with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. (KW2) for the provision of outreach education services to persons living with HIV or persons at significant risk of contracting HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, shigella or other sexually transmitted infections, or monkeypox in Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Licking, Madison, Morrow, Pickaway and Union Counties.  The outreach sought is through social and traditional media outlets, such as radio, billboards, social media platforms, dating apps and other relevant electronical or physical mediums.  The term of the contract is November 28, 2022 through July 31, 2023 with funding based on vendor estimates of annual funding requirements for allowable services. This ordinance also authorizes the Board of Health to modify the contract, if needed, if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds. \n \nKnupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. (KW2):  $222,123.00\n \n \nUsing Bonfire, competitive bids were advertised and solicited in accordance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 related to competitive bidding.  Specifically, Bonfire RFQ022658 posted on August 15, 2022 and covers a 36-month grant period with annual contracts being issued within the grant fiscal year, according to bidding requirements of the City Code.  Two bids were received and KW2 was selected based on the proposal meeting the needs of the program and their familiarity with the Sexual Health Promotions Program. In addition, service contracts for the ODH Ending the HIV Epidemic Grant Program are awarded by service category to subrecipient agencies based on capacity to provide services to clients within the jurisdiction according to the service standards set forth in the written agreement. A competitive process was used, but did not comply with 329.18, as such, this ordinance requests a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329.                                                                     \n  \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that quality medical care continues to be available to eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS and to ensure timely payment to providers.\n \nThe vendor is not debarred according to the Excluded Parties listing of the Federal Government and are not listed in the Auditor of States database for Findings for Recovery.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThe contract will be entered into by Columbus Public Health with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. (KW2) for services allowable under the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio Grant Program as well as comply with the RFQ and City bidding processes.  This ordinance will authorize one ACPO in the amount of $222,123.00 to encumber funds using available grant appropriations for contracts with vendors.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into a contract with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. (KW2) and to modify said contract if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds for the Implementing Enhanced HIV Prevention and Surveillance for Health Departments to End the HIV Epidemic in Ohio Grant Program for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio; to authorize the expenditure of $222,123.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; to waive competitive bidding of City Code Chapter 329; and to declare an emergency.
