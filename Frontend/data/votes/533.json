    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute a contract with Rubicon Global LLC for the provision of GPS tracking and route diagnostics for the Division of Refuse Collection fleet.\n \nThe aforementioned project will allow the Division of Refuse Collection to maximize efficiencies and to assess streets for pot holes, illegal dumping, and other street maintenance, as the vehicles travel around their assigned routes.\n \nRubicon is an on-demand routing solution that will interface with existing routing software systems Lucity and GIS. The process enhances efficiencies for the Division of Refuse Collection creating a streamlined option to develop optimized bulk collection and container management routes each day. Drivers receive the routing instructions through iPhones leased by Rubicon Global LLC, and the routes are developed through an online portal that will pull in all relevant information for that day. The phones also allow the drivers to take before and after pictures to confirm service.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Rubicon is CC034837 and expires February 5, 2023. \n3.  BID WAIVER \nThe Department of Public Service is seeking Council approval under City Code Section 329 to waive competitive bidding to facilitate the execution of a service contract for proprietary software with Rubicon because there is an immediate need to create route efficiencies for the Division of Refuse Collections service routes, and to assist with identifying street maintenance issues and illegal dumping sites throughout the City of Columbus.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $189,140.00 is available within Fund 7748, the General Permanent Improvement Fund, within the Department of Public Service. This ordinance will authorize an appropriation of $189,140.00 in Fund 7748 for this project. It is necessary to transfer budget authority between projects within Fund 7748 to align cash with the proper project.  \n5.  Emergency Justification\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the service contract so as not to delay the addition of needed route efficiencies, identifying street maintenance issues and illegal dumping sites, and cost savings therein.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget, to authorize the transfer of budget authority between projects within the General Permanent Improvement Fund;
