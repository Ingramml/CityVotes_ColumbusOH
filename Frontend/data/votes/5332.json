    "description": "Title\nTo object to the renewal of liquor permit number 84189940430 held by Speedway LCC LLC, doing business as SPEEDWAY #1216, located at 6175 East Livingston Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43232; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, City Council desires to object, pursuant to 4303.271 and 4303.292 of the Ohio Revised Code, to the renewal of liquor permit number 84189940430 held by Speedway LCC LLC, doing business as SPEEDWAY #1216, located at 6175 East Livingston Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43232; and\n \nWHEREAS, evidence from the Columbus Division of Police and the Columbus City Attorney’s office (see attached file \"Columbus Division of Police Letter - Speedway LCC LLC - SPEEDWAY #1216\") was presented to City Council as to the suitability of this permit holder and establishment to maintain liquor permit number 84189940430; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of City Council, in that it is immediately necessary to object to the renewal of this liquor permit prior to January 1, 2023 to meet state regulatory requirements, all to preserve the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Columbus City Council desires to object, pursuant to state statute, to the renewal of liquor permit number 84189940430 held by Speedway LCC LLC, doing business as SPEEDWAY #1216, located at 6175 East Livingston Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43232.\n \nSECTION 2. That the City Council, based on evidence provided by the Columbus Division of Police and the Columbus City Attorney’s office, hereby finds that the permit holder at such premises has operated the liquor permit business in a manner that demonstrates a disregard for the law, regulations or local ordinances of this state and city, which is a basis to refuse the renewal of a liquor permit under RC 4303.292(A)(1)(b); and further, the Council finds that the permit premises is so located with respect to the neighborhood that substantial interference with public decency, sobriety, peace or good order would result from the renewal of the permit and operation thereunder by the applicant, which also is a basis to refuse a liquor permit renewal under RC 4303.292(A)(2)(c); and based upon the above findings the City Council hereby objects to the renewal of this liquor permit.\n \nSECTION 3. That the City Clerk be and hereby is directed to forward a certified copy of this resolution to the director of the Ohio Department of Liquor Control, and with said resolution the City Attorney shall express his opinion regarding the basis for this resolution as required by 4303.271(B), Ohio Revised Code. The Clerk shall advise the City Attorney regarding the notice of any hearings pursuant to the objection.\n \nSECTION 4.
