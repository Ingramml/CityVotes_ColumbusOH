    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $180,000.00 in grant monies to fund the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program, for the period March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022.  The total amount funded for this period is $180,000.00.\n \nThe purpose of the grant program is to focus resources in jurisdictions with substantial HIV burden to implement strategies, interventions, approaches, and core medical and support services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States.  The overarching goal for this initiative is to reduce new HIV infections in the United States to less than 3,000 per year by 2030. \n \nHRSA has tasked CPH to improve the efficiency of the reallocation of federal funds as necessary in order to minimize unused funds to the greatest extent possible and to maximize the available services and avoid potential penalties as future carryover funds may not be permitted by HRSA.  For this reason, it is necessary to authorize the Board of Health to accept any additional awards for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; to authorize the appropriation of any additional awards for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; and to authorize the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Ending the HIV Epidemic Grant Program is entirely funded by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and does not generate revenue or require a City match. ($180,000.00) \n  \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept grant funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the amount of $180,000.00 and any additional funds for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; to authorize the appropriation of $180,000.00 and any additional funds from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; and to declare an emergency.  ($180,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $180,000.00 in grant funds have been made available through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program for the period of March 1, 2021 through February 28, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the support of the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, HRSA has tasked CPH to improve the efficiency of the reallocation of funds as necessary in order to minimize unused funds to the greatest extent possible in order to maximize the available services and to avoid potential penalties related to future grants; and   \n \nWHEREAS, the City may receive additional funds awarded from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the support of the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these additional funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the support of the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program as needed upon request by the Columbus Public Health department.; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to appropriate these funds to the Health Department for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare and to avoid delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
