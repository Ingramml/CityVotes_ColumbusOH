    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University College of Social Work to provide assistance for communications and outreach to senior residents, as well as to assist in a pilot program pertaining to climate resiliency among older adults (Age Friendly & Climate Smarter).   \n \nDuring the Big Table event co-hosted by Age-Friendly Columbus & Franklin County and Councilmember Barroso de Padilla, stakeholders discussed several issues with aging residents and access to services when climate change is affecting daily life more frequently.  This amendment focuses on two issues:  communications and outreach to older adults and climate resiliency for low-income seniors.  Council had allotted $50,000 in the 2022 budget for communications and outreach, and Age-Friendly will use funding for strategies to ensure access to services for all older residents, especially difficult-to-reach populations.  The second portion of the amendment is to partially fund a program called Age Friendly & Climate Smarter.  This pilot project will result in the development of a toolkit for service coordinators and others to use in affordable housing properties for older adult residents to become more prepared for extreme weather events. This work will center on the lived experiences of older adults in one affordable housing community in Columbus. Through a community-based research approach, Age-Friendly hopes to gain an understanding of challenges, barriers, strengths, and opportunities to ensure the well-being of these residents as they age in a warmer world.  \n \nColumbus City Council is supporting these efforts with $60,000.00 in funding from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Total appropriation is $60,000.00 and is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.    \n    \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Ohio State University College of Social Work, on behalf of Age-Friendly Columbus & Franklin County, in support of the organization’s communication and outreach efforts to older residents, as well as their Age Friendly & Climate Smarter pilot project; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $60,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($60,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the goal of The Ohio State University College of Social Work and Age-Friendly Columbus & Franklin County is to assist low-income seniors in our City with basic social needs; and\n \nWHEREAS, during stakeholder discussions, common issues of communication and resiliency were identified as common themes and items for Age-Friendly, City Council, and the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging to address; and\n \nWHEREAS, this budget amendment will fund OSU College of Social Work's and Age-Friendly's communications efforts, as well as a climate resiliency pilot to develop ways to age better in a warming world; and\n \nWHEREAS, $60,000.00 is available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund for appropriation and expenditure to provide for this need; and \n \nWHEREAS, this amendment will further Council's efforts to ensure access to services and programming to older adults in Columbus, as well as advance planning for improving aging in a warming world; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1:  That Columbus City Council is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the The Ohio State University College of Social Work, on behalf of Age Friendly Columbus & Franklin County, in support of communications and outreach efforts, as well as their climate resiliency pilot.\n \nSECTION 2.
