    "title": "To authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a design and construction agreement with the Nationwide Realty Investors for the Sensenbrenner Fountain Renovation Project; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code. ($0)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a design and construction agreement with the Nationwide Realty Investors (NRI) for the Sensenbrenner Fountain Renovation Project. This ordinance will also authorize the future contribution of up to $600,000.00 to reimburse Nationwide Realty Investors (NRI) for the successful completion of the Sensenbrenner Fountain Renovation Project.\n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has owned Sensenbrenner Park since 1974 and it has since developed into a ‘Pocket Park” for those working, playing, and living in the downtown area. The park was named after the late M.E. “Jack” Sensenbrenner, a former Mayor of Columbus. The park underwent renovations in 1998, 2009, and in 2011, which also included the fountain. The fountain is in need of critical renovations and this ordinance will authorize the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into an agreement with NRI for performing the project, including repairs and replacement of the components of the fountain. The agreement will focus on project objectives, construction process, NRI administration of the project, and project contributions. \n \nThe partnership with NRI has been long standing, including previous agreements in 1994 and 2015. This project is a continuation in demonstrating the partnership breadth and the overall benefits that the partnership has to the entire community. Without NRI working to identify contractors and manage this project, the fountain renovations would not be feasible at this time.  Therefore, it is in the City's best interests to waive the competitive bidding requirements of City Code. The project will expand the partnership with NRI, providing all contract and construction management for the project at no charge. In addition to managing the project, NRI will initially pay all costs up to $600,000.00. Reimbursement amounts will be adjusted to match project hard costs. As part of the agreement, the City’s cost for the Sensenbrenner Fountain Renovations Project will be to reimburse NRI, a not to exceed amount of $600,000.00 and this future contribution is being authorized by this ordinance. With separate future legislation, up to $600,000.00 will be requested for reimbursement of the work at the fountain. The reimbursement to NRI will be reimbursed in two installments of up to $300,000.00. The first reimbursement is projected to be in the fall of 2023 and the remaining balance is projected to be in the fall of 2024.\n \nThe intent of the project is to create an inclusionary environment where all members of our community feel comfortable and safe enjoying the benefits of the Sensenbrenner Fountain. It will also repair life-cycle fountain issues as part of a 10 year update, including items such as chemical delivery components, chemical storage, piping, and the repair of various mechanical and electrical components. It will also provide a visible upgrade from current functionality, with restored or new programmatic elements. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nNationwide Realty Investors\n375 North Front Street Suite 200\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                     \nG. Joey Williams, (952) 380-6878\n \nBenefits to the Public: The project will provide a renovated fountain for people to enjoy. Sitting, meditating, yoga, walking, running, and passive uses of parks provide highly recognized year-round benefits to urban lifestyles.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Sensenbrenner Park is in the heart of the downtown area and provides seating areas for the community.  The fountain has not been fully operational for many years and having the fountain functioning as an amenity is well supported by the community.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Downtown (55)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the mission of the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to ensure that amenities remain safe, updated, and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. Future legislation will encumber funding for this project as needed once the appropriate funding source has been identified and reimbursement is due.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a design and construction agreement with the Nationwide Realty Investors for the Sensenbrenner Fountain Renovation Project; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code.
