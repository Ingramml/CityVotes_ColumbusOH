    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize and Celebrate January 2 as U=U Day in the City of Columbus\nBody\nWHEREAS, U=U stands for Undetectable = Untransmittable; and\nWHEREAS, U=U is an educational campaign to raise awareness of the fact that a person living with HIV is unable to transmit the infection if their viral load is too low to measure; and \n \nWHEREAS, HIV medication can reliably reduce a person’s viral load below detectable levels, turning the once near-fatal diagnosis into a manageable condition; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is committed to ending the HIV epidemic, including through health education and partnering with community health organizations to providing testing, surveillance, and treatment; and \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council joins in the effort to raise awareness about HIV and take steps to mitigate the impact of the infection and encourages all community members to know their HIV status; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council recognizes and celebrates January 2nd as U=U Day in the City of Columbus.",
