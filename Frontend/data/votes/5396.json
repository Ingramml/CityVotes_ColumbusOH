The study will develop a plan for improvements to promote safety for all roadway users with a focus on reducing severe crashes and vehicular operating speeds.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to modify the contract in the amount of $250,000.00.\n \nThis modification is necessary to cover the cost of the third task for the project.  This task is inherently part of the Study that was initiated by original contract and is not practical to separate the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $150,000.00                     (PO316118, Ord. 0473-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $250,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                        $400,000.00\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CHA Consulting, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for CHA Consulting, Inc.  is CC000802 and expires 03/26/2023.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $250,000.00 is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so the project can proceed as quickly as possible so that safety standards can be updated as soon as possible, to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract modification with CHA Consulting, Inc. in connection with the UIRF - Livingston Avenue Pedestrian Safety Study project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($250,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
