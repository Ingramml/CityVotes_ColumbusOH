    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the emergency shelter repair agreement with Southeast Inc by extending the Agreement (PO-196106) termination date to June 30, 2021; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify Agreement PO-196106 with Southeast Inc by extending the Agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021. This extension will allow Southeast Inc to fully complete emergency shelter repairs of real property located at 924 E Main St, Columbus, OH 43205. \n \nOne of the impacts of COVID-19 was the quarantine period in which the Southeast, Inc could not get a company in the building to work. Southeast Inc.’s ability to complete the bathroom renovation and life safety items tied to shelter capacity expansion has been affected by unanticipated delays due to difficulty in getting contractors to work at the shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic. The original general contractor hired to complete the work abandoned the job and Southeast, Inc had to identify and hire multiple independent contractors to complete various aspects of the work. Currently repairs are in progress. This legislation would modify the Agreement authorized by Ordinance No. 2819-2019.\n \nEmergency action is requested so repair activities can continue and be completed without further delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are needed for this modification.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the emergency shelter repair agreement with Southeast Inc by extending the Agreement (PO-196106) termination date to June 30, 2021; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to modify Agreement PO-196106 with Southeast Inc by extending the Agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification supports the purpose of Southeast Inc fully completing emergency shelter repairs of real property located at 924 E Main St, Columbus, OH 43205; and\n \nWHEREAS, no additional funds are needed to modify this agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to modify the agreement with Southeast Inc so repair activities can continue and be completed without further delay, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify Agreement PO-196106 with Southeast Inc by extending the Agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to Agreement modifications.  \n \nSECTION 3.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
