    "description": "Title\n \nTo recognize March 24th 2021 as Equal Pay Day in Columbus and commend Women for Economic and Leadership Development for their effort to raise awareness on the gender pay gap.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Equal Pay Day is the symbolic day dedicated to raising awareness of the gender pay gap; and\n \nWHEREAS, this day denotes how far into the new year women must work to be paid what men were paid the previous year; and \n \nWHEREAS, started by the National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) in 1996, the goal was to raise awareness about the gender wage gap; and\n \nWHEREAS, today, various Equal Pay Days are recognized to denote that mothers and most women of color face a wider-than-average gap and need to work even longer to catch up to men’s earnings; and\n \nWHEREAS, Women for Economic and Leadership Development’s (WELD) mission is to develop and advance women’s leadership to strengthen the economic prosperity of the communities it serves; and\n \nWHEREAS, WELD provides women with specific tools to enhance their individual economic status and builds programs to support female leadership development and business growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, WELD builds awareness about pay disparity, especially that experienced by women of color, in the national forums it hosts; and\n \nWHEREAS, these forums bring actions to words by providing specific strategies that individuals, businesses and organizations can implement to close the gaps; and\n \nWHEREAS, WELD helps the corporate arena understand the connections between the lack of diverse representation on their boards and in their executive ranks; and \n \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nThat this Council does hereby, recognize March 24th 2021 as Equal Pay Day in the City of Columbus and commend Women for Economic Leadership and Development for their effort to raise awareness on the gender pay gap.",
