    "description": "Background\n \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\n \nRound 1 grants engaged and expanded the MBK network in Columbus by supporting work focused on boys and young men of color.  The opportunity to innovate is important as we work collectively to enhance outcomes for boys and young men of color. Round 2 grants supported the work of non-profit agencies to test new approaches and or create new partnerships in the areas of education and safety. Round 3 grants will build on lessons learned to help close the achievement gap. \n \nThis legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $400,000.00 from the general operating dollars; Fund 1000; and authorizes the Director of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with African American Male Wellness Agency, Always With Us Charities, Columbus Urban League, Heart of JOB and Ice Mentors in an amount up to $400,000.00 to provide in-school and after-school academic based interventions. \n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to ensure that services are available for the remainder of the academic school year.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funding is available within the general fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor numbers are:\n \nAfrican American Male Wellness Agency 008384 and is valid from 5/16/2022 - 5/16/2024\nAlways With Us Charities 018333 pending\nColumbus Urban League 006073 and is valid from 2/22/2022 - 2/22/2024\nHeart of Job Foundation 041659 and is 4/24/22 - 4/27/24\nICE Mentors 042295 and is valid 6/28/22 - 6/28/2024\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with  African American Male Wellness Agency, Always With Us Charities, Columbus Urban League, Heart of JOB and Ice Mentors in a total amount of up to $400,000.00 to provide in-school and after-school academic interventions; to authorize the expenditure of up to $400,000 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
