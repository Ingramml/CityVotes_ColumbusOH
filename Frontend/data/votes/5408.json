    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus receives annual grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in order to affirmatively further fair housing and provide decent housing, suitable living environments, and expanded economic opportunities. The City’s HUD 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan combines into a single submission the planning and application aspects of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs, and represents the City’s commitment to delivering these programs over the five-year period.\n \nEach year, the City of Columbus, Department of Finance and Management, Grants Management Section is responsible for completing and submitting Annual Action Plans to HUD. Annual Action Plans identify projects and establish budgets for the City’s HUD grant programs, and summarize annual efforts for consultation, citizen participation, and anticipated outcomes.  Because HUD has not announced the 2023 grant allocations, this legislation contains a Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan Summary with estimated funding amounts based on historic figures. The final plan will be adjusted to match the actual allocations upon receipt of notices of awards. The Fiscal Year 2023 allocations are expected to be announced in spring 2023. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The City expects to receive approximately $15 million in grant awards for the four programs listed above. This legislation authorizes the Mayor to accept those grant awards and enter into grant agreements with HUD, and City Departments managing these awards will submit future legislation to authorize both the appropriation and expenditure of those funds. \n \nTitle\n \nTo adopt the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan which implements the fourth year of the five-year Consolidated Plan for the CDBG, HOME, ESG and HOPWA programs; to authorize the acceptance of 2023 HUD Community Planning and Development grant awards; and to authorize the filing of the final FY 2023 Annual Action Plan with the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, under the provisions as set forth in the various federal statutes authorizing the above programs, the City of Columbus has filed a five-year Consolidated Plan application with the Department of Housing and Urban Development to be used for community development activities; and\n \nWHEREAS, in conjunction with the Consolidated Plan, the City is required to submit a one-year Annual Action Plan detailing the various projects to be funded under the plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus receives formula grants on an annual basis from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Office of Community Planning and Development for the CDBG, HOME, ESG, and HOPWA programs; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Grants Management Section conducted a public input process in compliance with the 2020-2024 City of Columbus Citizen Participation Plan, including hosting two public meetings and providing separate fifteen day and thirty day public comment periods, and received more than forty comments from the public; and\n \nWHEREAS, the final FY 2023 award allocations from HUD will be received in spring 2023, and the project budgets contained in the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan may be adjusted and upon notices of awards the final FY 2023 Annual Action Plan will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management to adopt the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan which implements the fourth year of the five-year Consolidated Plan for the CDBG, HOME, ESG and HOPWA programs;  Now, Therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1: That the City of Columbus hereby adopts the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan.  \n \nSECTION 2: That the Department of Finance and Management may revise the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan’s project budgets and upon notices of awards will submit a final FY 2023 Annual Action Plan to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \n \nSECTION 3: That the Mayor, acting on behalf of the City of Columbus, is hereby authorized to adopt the final FY 2023 Annual Action Plan, enter into grant agreements with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and accept the Fiscal Year 2023 estimated combined $15,000,000 in funds for the CDBG, HOME, ESG, and HOPWA grant programs.\n  \nSECTION 4: That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
