    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and celebrate National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day 2021 in Columbus, Ohio.\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day is an opportunity to celebrate the family-owned businesses that contribute to the heart, soul, and fabric of Columbus; and\n                     \nWHEREAS, every year National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day occurs on the 29th of March and after this past year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to highlight these important and special businesses; and\n \nWHEREAS, as small and independently owned businesses, mom-and-pop shops, restaurants, hotels, and other businesses represent the building blocks of our local economy. They create jobs, reinvest in the community, and support local initiatives; and\n \nWHEREAS, in 2020, over 850 small, minority, and women-owned businesses received $8.3 million from the Columbus-Franklin County COVID-19 Small Business Response and Recovery Fund. The Fund used CARES Act dollars to offer grants, low-interest loans, and technical assistance for small businesses in the Greater Columbus area impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus, Ohio is a welcoming city and prides itself on our inclusive vision and access to opportunities for individuals and families to start their own business, no matter where they come from or the language they speak; and\n \nWHEREAS, mom-and-pop business owners build relationships with their customers and communities that cannot be measured. In order to honor the people behind many of this city’s small businesses, Columbus City Council encourages everyone to visit a family-owned business in this community this week; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day on Monday, March 29, 2021 in Columbus, Ohio.",
