    "title": "To authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase pre-owned vehicles with Ricart Properties, Inc.; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase police pursuit vehicles with George Byers Sons, Inc.; to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify two existing Universal Term Contracts (UTC) in order to permit the Fleet Management Division sufficient flexibility to purchase thirty-four (34) units necessary to support various City agencies.  The first contract is PA004555 with Ricart Properties, Inc., for the purchase or pre-used vehicles. The contract will be modified to allow for the purchase of eighteen (18) pre-owned Ford EcoSports at market price. The contract currently only allows for the purchase of items at $1,485 over black book clean wholesale price. \n \nThe second contract is PA004948 with George Byers Sons, Inc. for the purchase of police vehicles. The contract will be modified to allow for the purchase of sixteen (16) Ford Escapes at retail price. The contract currently only allows for the purchase of items at $85 over triple net dealer invoice. The higher price for these items on both contracts is caused by the international supply chain disruption, and high inflation. These issues were unforeseen at the time the contracts were solicited. It \n \nThe original contracts were formally bid, and approved by Council action. PA004555 with Ricart Properties, Inc. was approved by Ordinance 0364-2020. PA004948 with George Byers Sons, Inc. was approved by Ordinance 1457-2020.\n \nEmergency Designation:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation be considered an emergency measure. The 34 (units) are currently available. They will be sold to other potential customers if the City is unable to purchase them in an expedient manner. Because of the international supply chain disruption, other units for purchase are not currently available. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are necessary to modify the option contracts as requested.  The Fleet Management Division will present separate legislation to authorize the necessary expenditures.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase pre-owned vehicles with Ricart Properties, Inc.; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify an existing Universal Term Contract for the option to purchase police pursuit vehicles with George Byers Sons, Inc.; to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into Universal Term Contracts for pre-owned vehicles and police pursuit vehicles; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing said Universal Term Contracts in order to provide vehicles for various City agencies; and\n \nWHEREAS, the global supply chain disruption requires the City to purchase thirty four (34) units at prices higher than the original contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Finance and Management Department, Fleet Management Division in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify the Universal Term Contracts with Ricart Properties, Inc. and George Byers Sons, Inc., so that available vehicles may be purchased by the City instead of other potential customers and due to the international supply chain disruption, other units for purchase are not currently available, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify a Universal Term Contract for pre-owned vehicles with Ricart Properties, Inc.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify a Universal Term Contract for police pursuit vehicles with George Byers Sons, Inc.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the reason stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
