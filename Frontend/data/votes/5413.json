    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders and additional funding for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks for the Columbus Division of Fire and City of Columbus Division of Police. These purchase orders for the vehicle purchases will be issued from Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) that have been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. \n \nPurchase orders will be established with George Byers Sons Inc, (PA004790 & PA004948) for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks and Ricart Properties Inc (PA004555) for the purchase of used Ford EcoSports.\n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, vendor#006008, PA004790 & PA004948, expires 6/30/23 - ($491,691.00)\nRicart Properties Inc, vendor#004963, PA004555, expires 3/30/2023 - ($113,695.00)\n \nThese vehicles are to be purchased as replacements for older, high mileage, and high maintenance vehicles currently in service and as such will reduce maintenance expenses, fuel consumption, and general upkeep costs.  \n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the combined expenditure of $605,386.00 with George Byers Sons and Ricart Properties Inc for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks for use by the Columbus Division of Fire and Columbus Division of Police. The funds will be expended from the Special Income Tax Fund. $7.2 million was budgeted for the 2021 Citywide Vehicle Acquisitions.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to market volatility of automobile manufactures and increased shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. It would be advantageous for the City to process these purchase orders as soon as possible in order to offset potential delays due to supply chain pressures. \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles for use by the Division of Fire and Division of Police with George Byers Sons Inc and Ricart Properties Inc; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $605,386.00 from the Special Income Tax Fund; and to declare an emergency.
