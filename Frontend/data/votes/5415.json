    "description": "Background: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Technical Choice for the Turnberry Golf Course Radio Repeater System Project. The contract amount is $62,494.00, with a contingency of $7,506.00, for a total of $70,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nWith over 30,000 rounds played in 2021, Turnberry Golf Course saw an increase of over 21% in rounds played over the previous 5 years and 2022 is trending in the same direction. The course is slowly becoming a known for its great playing conditions and is now home to Ohio Dominican Golf and many youth golf tournaments, including three high school sectional tournaments. For years the maintenance staff have been hampered with an irrigation system that cannot communicate back to the maintenance shop. Staff have had to water by manually flipping switches every morning out on the course. The control boxes have also been flooded three times in six years and need repaired or replaced as a result. Irrigation is critical to our golf courses in order to provide the best possible playing surfaces for our guests. This project will greatly improve efficiencies and provide improvements to the irrigation system. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on October 13, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on October 25, 2022. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nTechnical Choice (MAJ): $62,494.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Technical Choice was the lowest and most responsive bidder.
