    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Mid-Ohio Electric for the Mentel Memorial Golf Course Irrigation Improvements Project. The contract amount is $56,803.05, with a contingency of $5,680.31, for a total of $62,483.36 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nWith over 38,000 rounds in 2021, Mentel Memorial Golf Course saw an increase of over 20% in rounds played over the previous five years and 2022 is trending in the same direction. The irrigation pumps and motors are 26 years old and have been in a decline over the past few years. Irrigation is critical to our golf courses in order to provide the best possible playing surfaces to our guests. This project will replace the existing pumps, have the motors rewound, rebuild a clay valve, install starters, and install overloads to the system. After reinstallation there will be a start and testing required to ensure the system works properly. This project will greatly improve efficiencies and the reliability of the irrigation system. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on September 26, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on October 14, 2022.
