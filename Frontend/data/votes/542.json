    "description": "Title\n \nTo recognize Minority Health Month in the City of Columbus and to encourage a year round commitment to reducing health care inequities while promoting systematic efforts that work to improve the Social Determinates of Health for us all. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Minority Health Month was first started more than 105 years ago when Dr. Booker T. Washington wrote a letter in April of 1915 arguing that \"Health was the key to progress and equity in all other things - and that without health and long life, all else fails;\" and \n WHEREAS, Dr. Washington called on local health departments, schools, churches, businesses, professional associations, and the most influential organizations within the African-American community to \"pull together and to unite in one great National Health Movement;\" and\n WHEREAS, this observance has grown into  a month-long initiative to advance health equity across the country on behalf of all racial and ethnic minorities - now known as National Minority Health Month; and\nWHEREAS, health disparities have existed in America for more than 400 years - however we are witnessing a coronavirus pandemic that is highlighting the long-running racial divide - black patients are dying in larger-than-expected numbers and are disproportionately suffering due to long standing unaddressed health disparities; and  \nWHEREAS, African Americans experience high rates of homelessness, incarceration, reduced educational opportunity, life expectancy, adverse childhood experiences, health outcomes, and economic hardship as a result of years of discriminatory lending practices, redlining, limited access to nutritious food, increased rates of lead poisoning, access to clean water, infant mortality and chronic disease which include asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and more; and\nWHEREAS, this Council recognizes these disparities as a public health crisis that affects us all - and deserves action from every level of a civil society - moreover this council applauds Columbus Public Health and the Office of Minority Health for steadfastly bringing these issues to our community’s attention with a year around focus on health awareness, disease prevention, and strategies to reduce health inequities in Columbus and the surrounding region; and\nWHEREAS, this Council urges every sector of Government to declare these disparities as a public health emergency and to immediately take steps to address and fund and support areas that strategically reduce the long term impact of the Social Determinants of Health for at risk communities - this includes reducing and eliminating preferential opportunities for some while subjecting the disadvantaged and people of color to hardships and disadvantages in every area of life; now therefore,\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \nThat this Council does hereby recognize Minority Health Month in the City of Columbus and encourages a year round commitment to reducing health care inequities while promoting systematic efforts that work to improve the Social Determinates of Health for us all.",
