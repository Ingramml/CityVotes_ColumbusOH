The WPCLF Loan Fund program provides below-market interest rate loans for municipal Wastewater and Stormwater system improvements.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:  There is sufficient budget authority in the 2023 Sewer Systems and Stormwater Operating Funds for the loan application fee expenditures.  These loans will be paid off over a 20-year period from Sewerage System and Stormwater rates (dedicated source of repayment).  Sewerage System and Stormwater rate increases have been projected and planned in anticipation of these projects and loans.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to apply for, accept, and enter into up to sixty-five (65) Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund Loan Agreements with the Ohio Water Development Authority and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, for the financing of up to sixty-five Division of Sewerage and Drainage construction projects; and to designate a dedicated source of repayment for the loans.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS,  the Department of Public Utilities is scheduled to prepare loan applications for up to $677 million in financing, for submittal to the Ohio EPA under the Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) program to finance, through below-market interest rate loans, the construction of up to sixty-five capital improvements projects under the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, which said financial assistance may be of help in reducing total project costs to the City's Sewerage and Stormwater customers; and\n \nWHEREAS, prior to WPLCF loan agreement approval by the Ohio Water Development Authority, the WPCLF loan application and loan agreement documents require the City to submit to the Ohio EPA a certified copy of approved City Council legislation authorizing the Director of the Public Utilities Department to apply for and subsequently execute said WPCLF agreements, and to authorize a dedicated source of loan repayment for the loans; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities to authorize the Director to apply for, accept and enter into WPCLF loan agreements with Ohio Water Development Authority and submit a copy of this legislation to the Ohio EPA prior to the OWDA board's consideration for approval as part of the loan agreements’ approval process; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to apply for, accept, and enter into up to sixty-five (65) Water Pollution Control Loan Fund Loan Agreements with the Ohio Water Development Authority and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, for the financing of up to sixty-five Division of Sewerage and Drainage projects as described with the \"not to exceed\" project costs listed below:\n \n\n\n\n1\n\n610050-100000\n\nFountain Square Stormwater System Improvements\n\n$5,600,000.00\n\n\n\n2\n\n610739-100000\n\nPetzinger Rd.
