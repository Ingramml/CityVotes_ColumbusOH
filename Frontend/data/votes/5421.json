    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.   BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (Mod #1) a professional engineering agreement with GS-OH, Inc. for the Jackson Pike WWTP Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements, CIP 650277-100000 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage. \n \nThe City’s Wastewater Treatment Plants require continual development and upgrades in order to keep processes and equipment up to date, in compliance, and running well.  All re-development requires compliance with the City of Columbus Stormwater and Drainage Manual as well as OEPA Stormwater general permit and FEMA requirements.  This project will provide a phased development stormwater and floodplain masterplan for the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant. The first phase of the contract provided preliminary engineering, which analyzed several alternatives for meeting these regulations and account for any unmitigated historical impacts as well as impacts for future development.  \n \nThe current legislation will provide for the detailed design phase to construct the chosen alternative.  A future renewal will be for engineering services during construction to ensure the design intents are met.   \n        1.1   Modification Information: Amount of additional funds:  $879,100.78\nOriginal contract                                $   556,933.18 (PO242741)\nModification #1 (current)                    $   879,100.78\nTotal Contract                                    $ 1,436,100.96 \n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis was a planned contract modification for design services after alternatives analysis completed during preliminary engineering.  \n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nIf this phase of the project were bid out it would result in inefficiencies and added fees, while attempting to bring a new consultant up to speed on the design, and repeating hydraulic modeling and analysis from the first phase.  The design team that performed the preliminary engineering phase of design has key technical knowledge regarding the design intent which is required for progressing into detailed design.\n 1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by GS-OH Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage, and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.\n \n2.  THE PROJECT TIMELINE: The original agreement for preliminary engineering is complete.  This contract modification is for detailed design work. A second contract modification is expected first quarter 2025 for services during construction.  The projected end date for this contract is second quarter 2027, however, this timeframe could be extended depending on the complexities encountered during design and construction.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency legislation is not being requested at this time.\n \n4.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE NO: 62-1736493| MAJ | EXP. 1/24/2024 | Vendor #: 009789\n \n5.  ECONOMIC IMPACT: This project will take a holistic approach to site development at the wastewater treatment plant site.  It will be more efficient to perform all of the stormwater and floodplain design under one contract, providing compliance to stormwater and drainage manual, and reducing coordination efforts and delays on other CIP projects within the department.\n \n6.  FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of up to $879,100.78 from the Sanitary the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify a professional engineering services agreement with GS-OH Inc. for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage for the Jackson Pike WWTP Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $879,100.78 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund ($879,100.78).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a planned modification for the Jackson Pike WWTP Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements with GS-OH Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original engineering agreement was authorized by Ordinance No. 1502-2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of up to $879,100.78 from the Sanitary Sewer System GO Bond Fund 6109; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing professional engineering services agreement with GS-OH Inc. for the Jackson Pike WWTP Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements; now, therefore                     \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify the professional engineering services agreement with GS-OH Inc., 10 West Broad Street, Suite 1650; Columbus, OH 43215, for the Jackson Pike WWTP Stormwater and Floodplain Improvements, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the office of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to expend up to $879,100.78 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109 per the accounting codes in the attached funding template.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the said firm, GS-OH Inc., shall perform the work to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Utilities and the Administrator of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project by monies from more than one source. \n \nSECTION 7. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 8. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
