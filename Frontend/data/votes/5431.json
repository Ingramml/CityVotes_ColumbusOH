    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with EMH&T for the City of Columbus Stormwater Management Plan (SWMP) Update Project. The project consists of targeted document updates that capture the necessary programmatic updates prompted by the renewal of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit, as recently issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio EPA). The project will include meetings to obtain stakeholder input and stakeholder reviews in addition to the SWMP document updates that will cover multiple sections, appendices, and the table of contents. The updates to the SWMP must be performed in accordance to the NPDES MS4 permit issued to the City of Columbus.\n \nThis contract will allow the City of Columbus to update the current SWMP to align with the new requirements of the newly issued MS4 permit to the City from OEPA. Updating the SWMP to be in alignment with the new permit provides the City an advantage of being in compliance with regulatory requirements. Not updating the SWMP could result in being out of compliance with the MS4 permit, which could then risk fines or other adverse consequences associated with not being in compliance with the regulatory requirements.  The update also affords the City the opportunity to reassess operational procedures in the SWMP. The updates can help streamline compliance and improve the environmental impact of the activities that are performed by the City. The updates will give the City the advantage of being compliant and in the forefront of protecting the environment, all of which supports the development of the City and the economic growth of the citizens of Columbus. \n \nThis contract is for one (1) year from date of execution.

This contract does not automatically renew.\n \nPROCUREMENT: The project was formally advertised (RFQ023085) on the Vendor Services website and Bonfire from October 7, 2022 to October 28, 2022.  The city received one (1) response.
