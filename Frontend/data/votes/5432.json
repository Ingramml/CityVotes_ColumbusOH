    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into professional engineering services agreement with Dynotec to provide general engineering design services for Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) street lighting projects, under Capital Improvement Project Number 440007-100024.  Services will be authorized on a task order basis as needed. One consultant will be awarded the contract in the amount of $100,000, funded for a minimum one year period, with annual renewal options for two additional years at $100,000 each.  First year projects are the design of pedestrian scale lighting on median parkways in the Franklinton area on Dakota Ave and Guilford St. \n \nPROCUREMENT:  The Division of Power advertised for a Request for Proposals (RFP’s) for the subject services on the City’s Vendor Services website and the Bonfire website and were opened on July 29, 2022 in accordance with the overall provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Codes. The Division of Power received five (5) responses from Advanced Engineering Consultants, Dynotec, Inc, EMH&T, ms consultants, and SINGH + Associates, Inc. The proposals were evaluated by the Evaluation Committee and scored them based on the criteria within Columbus City Codes Chapter 329.  The Department of Public Utilities recommends the agreement be awarded to Dynotec, Inc.\n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: It is estimated that the notice to proceed will occur in December 2022.  All work shall be substantially completed within 270 calendar days of the notice to proceed with final completion to occur within 365 days.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is requested in order to meet project timelines so better lighting can be installed for safety and security of residents.   \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER: 31-1319961 | MBE | EXP 4/18/2024 | Vendor # 005053\n \nENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This contract will design street lighting improvements in areas identified by the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Program. Replacing old HPS fixtures with LED technology will generate savings in electric energy, reduce greenhouse gases and long-term maintenance.  Additionally, the replacement of aging HPS luminaires with new LED fixtures will provide greater light output and better color rendering.  This will help pedestrians and motorists better identify objects at night. Street lighting has many benefits including improving traffic and pedestrian safety, and providing residents a better sense of safety and security. This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes a transfer and expenditure up to $100,000.00 from the Electricity G.O. Fund 6303.
