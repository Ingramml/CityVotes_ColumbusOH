    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew a contract with Mann Roofing & Construction LLC for an additional year to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $345,000.00                     Ord. 1836-2021                      PO292019        PY 2021 & 2022\nModification No. 1 amount                     $160,000.00                     Ord. 2098-2022                                                                                    PY 2023\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $           0.00                                                                                                                              PY 2023\nTotal contract amount                                          $505,000.00\n \nThe Roof Replacement Program is a home repair program operated by the City's Housing Division funded by Community Development Block Grant funds. The program was established to assist low and moderate-income homeowners with roof repairs that constitute a critical condition, and when such condition is not corrected, could cause the homeowner to vacate their home.\n \nThe department advertised RFQ019058 on Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide roof replacement services June 18, 2021 through July 12, 2021. Five bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with two bidders under the authority of ordinance 1836-2021.  \n \nUnder the original contract, the contract period was from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2022.  \n \nIn July 2022, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 2098-2022 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  However, the contract modification has not yet been executed.  \n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023, and the contract renewal will include the additional funds authorized under ordinance 2098-2022.\n \nAdvertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result a delay in providing these services.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract and the escalation request approved by the Director on March 9, 2022.\n \nThis legislation represents expenditure for a part of the CDBG portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available on ACPO008071.  Only $50,000.00 will be put on the contract renewal with the ACPO to be cancelled after the PO is confirmed.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 032158 and expires 3/28/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract with Mann Roofing & Construction LLC for an additional year to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew a contract with Mann Roofing & Construction LLC for an additional year to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ019058 on Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide roof replacement services on July 12, 2021, and the Director of Development entered into contract with Mann Roofing & Construction LLC under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 2098-2022 to modify the contract to add additional funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to renew the contract with Mann Roofing & Construction LLC to allow program services to continue without interruption, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to renew a contract with Mann Roofing & Construction LLC for an additional year, ending December 31, 2023, to provide residential roof replacement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Roof Replacement Program.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
