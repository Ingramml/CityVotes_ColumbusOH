    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Renter Mentor, LLC for services associated with the Housing for All Community Education Campaign.\n \nIn March 2021, Columbus City Council passed the Housing for All legislative package that amended Chapters 4501 and 4551 of Columbus City Code. The amendments address some of the critical affordable housing challenges within the City of Columbus by providing residents fair access and protections in the search for affordable housing. In July 2021, Columbus City Council engaged Renter Mentor to execute community events to educate residents, landlords, and other stakeholders on the changes to Columbus housing laws.\n \nThere is now a need to engage Renter Mentor again for additional community engagement services for education around the Housing for All initiative. A maximum amount of $300 per event may go towards light snacks and beverages for individuals who attend the events. Any purchase of alcohol is strictly prohibited.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in the execution of additional community education events.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Renter Mentor, LLC for services associated with the Housing for All Community Education Campaign; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
