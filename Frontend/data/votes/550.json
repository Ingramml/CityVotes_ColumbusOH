    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Division of Police needs to transfer money from the State Law Enforcement Contraband Seizure Fund to the General Fund.   Funds were transferred into the seizure fund in error through a revenue correction last year.  Only a portion of the amount transferred to the seizure fund was from a forfeited car sold at auction.  The remaining portion should have remained in the general fund for the sale of impound cars at auction. There is an additional need to appropriate seizure funds in the amount of $46,725.00 into object class 10 which is the transfer line, thereby allowing the division to transfer the funds back to the general fund. \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is necessary in order to transfer revenue back into the correct fund.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This transaction authorizes the appropriation and transfer of funds from the State Law Enforcement Contraband Seizure Fund to the General Fund. The Funds were inadvertently deposited into the Seizure Fund instead of the General Fund. This transaction will correct that error.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an appropriation in the State Law Enforcement Contraband Seizure Fund; to authorize the transfer of funds from the State Law Enforcement Contraband Seizure Fund to the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
