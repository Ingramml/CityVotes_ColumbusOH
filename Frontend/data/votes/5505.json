    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to reimburse NWD Investments, LLC (“NWD”) $5,000,000.00 in connection with public infrastructure improvements located along Vine Street and Goodale Boulevard on the east and west side of Neil Avenue.\n \nThe City and NWD are engaged in a public-private partnership (P3) to coordinate the design and construction of public infrastructure improvements necessary to support new mixed-use development projects in the Arena District (the “Arena District Improvements”). On October 31, 2019, the City and NWD entered into both an Economic Development Agreement (the “EDA”) and a subsequent Amended and Restated TIF Reimbursement Agreement (the “TIF Agreement”), both pursuant to Ordinance 2043-2019 passed by Council on July 22, 2019. The City is authorized by Ordinance 2043-2019, as amended by Ordinance 2932-2021, passed by Council on December 6, 2021, to execute subsequent agreements and instruments with NWD related to the Arena District Improvements pursuant to the TIF Agreement. In the EDA and TIF Agreement, the City committed funds from the City’s capital improvement budget (the “Public Infrastructure Commitment”) toward the costs of the Arena District Improvements. \n \nThe first $5,000,000.00 authorized by Ordinance 2061-2022 was used to reimburse NWD for the Arena District Improvements associated with the Hamilton Parker Phase 1 site redevelopment. A portion was completed in 2021 and included a new 130,000 square foot office building and 600-space structured parking garage. The Arena District Improvements to-date have included the reconstruction of Kilbourne Street, widening of Neil Avenue north of Vine Street, and the resurfacing of Vine Street, Spruce Street, and Armstrong Street; relocation of City of Columbus Division of Power poles and equipment along the west side of Kilbourne Street; combined sewer relocation on Vine Street between Kilbourne Street and Neil Avenue. \n \nThe second $5,000,000.00 of the Public Infrastructure Commitment was budgeted in the 2022 capital improvement budget approved by City Council with the passage of Ordinance 1896-2022 on July 25, 2022. There are roughly $1,000,000.00 of outstanding costs ready for reimbursement, and an estimated ±$3,500,000.00 of new costs anticipated for an AEP transmission line relocation on Vine Street.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis project was budgeted in the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget, but the funds will not be available to the department until a bond sale takes place related to the 2022 capital improvement budget. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary.  Funding for this reimbursement in the amount of $5,000,000.00 is available through the Special Income Tax Fund, Fund 4430, and funds will be appropriated and transferred to the Development Taxable Bond Fund 7739. The funding will need to be appropriated and authorized for expenditure from Fund 7739.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to allow NWD to maintain it project schedule and to reimburse NWD in a timely manner thereby allowing the parties to maintain cost efficiency. ($5,000,000.00)\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Special Income Tax Fund to the Development Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of funds in the Development Taxable Bond Fund in an amount of up to $5,000,000.00 in connection with the costs of the public infrastructure improvements located along Vine Street and Goodale Boulevard on the east and west side of Neil Avenue pursuant to the Amended and Restated TIF Agreement dated October 31, 2019 and its subsequent agreements authorized by Ordinance 2043-2019, as amended by Ordinance 2932-2021; to amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; and to declare an emergency.
