    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into contract with various vendors for the purchase of a studio camera system with tele-prompters to be used by CTV.  Through quality programming, CTV (Columbus’ government television channel) provides local citizenry with important information about Columbus City government and increases citizen access to city officials and staff. CTV programs highlight the civic and cultural landscape of Columbus through various weekly public-affairs shows and the airing of live government meetings and press conferences. To ensure that CTV can continue to provide high quality content, it is necessary to update and replace older, obsolete equipment.\nOn November 17th, 2022, bids to replace the above-described system were opened. Six bids were received, with four different vendors submitting low and responsive bids on different parts of the system. As such, DoT recommends that bids be awarded to B&H Foto and Electronics, iVideo Technologies, Focus Camera and Tarazi, LLC for up to $47,106.18, $49,287.68, $33,880.00, and $17,998.00 respectively. In most cases, the low bidder of an item was selected. However, on three of the items, an alternate product was bid by B&H. Since it was determined that the alternate products would not work with the system, bids in these cases were awarded to the next lowest bidder (iVideo and Tarazi). Other bidders (and their total bids) were as follows:\n•                     Mr. Cheapo.com-                                          $176,319.74 \n•                     Red Vest Supply-                                          $182,803.94\nThis ordinance also authorizes Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with iVideo Technologies, LLC for the installation of the above-noted camera system. This vendor recently installed various other equipment in CTV’s studio control room, as authorized by ordinance 2669-2022. Because this vendor is quite knowledgeable on CTV’s control room structure, DoT wishes to contract with them again to install the new camera system. However, since this service was not bid out, a waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes is required. \nFunds for the both the purchase of the equipment and its installation are budgeted in the Department of Finance and Management in object code 03 (services). As such, it is necessary to transfer $148,271.86 from 03 to 06 (equipment) for the purchase of the hardware.\nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the total expenditure of $171,386.08, ($148,271.86 for hardware and $23,114.22 for its installation) from “citywide technology purchases” allocation of the Department of Finance and Management’s 2022 general fund budget. \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the purchase of a new studio camera system and its installation are budgeted and available in the “citywide technology purchases” allocation of the Department of Finance and Management’s 2022 general fund budget. \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nB&H Foto and Electronics, Inc.; C.C/F.I.D.#: 13-2768071; Expiration Date: 11/17/2023\nDAX vendor no.: 000621\niVideo Technologies, LLC; C.C/F.I.D.#: 27 - 4267240; Expiration Date: 9/1/2023\nDAX vendor no.: 011533\nFocus Camera, LLC; C.C/F.I.D.# 20-0493890; Expiration Date: 7/7/2023\nDAX vendor no.: 038231\nTarazi, LLC; C.C/F.I.D.# 84-3647481; Expiration Date: 4/19/2024\nDAX vendor no.: 031380\nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested on this ordinance so that funds can be encumbered prior to the 2022 year-end closure by the City Auditor’s Office.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contracts with B&H Foto and Electrnoics, iVideo Technologies and Focus Camera for the purchase of a studio camera system with tele-prompters; to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with iVideo Technologies, LLC, for the installation of the above-noted studio camera system; to waive the of competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes as it relates to the contract with iVideo Technologies, LLC; to authorize the transfer of $148,271.86 in the “citywide technology purchases” allocation of the Department of Finance and Management’s 2022 general fund budget; to authorize the expenditure of up to $171,386.08 for the above-described purposes from the “citywide technology purchases” allocation of the Department of Finance and Management’s 2022 general fund budget; and to declare an emergency.
