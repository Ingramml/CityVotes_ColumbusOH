BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $100,000.00 for the purchase of materials, supplies and services for the Department of Public Service to support the Thurman Ave Speed Management Pilot Project and the Mobility Hub Pilot Project(s).  \n \na.                     Thurman Ave Speed Management Pilot Project\nThrough this allocation of funds, the Department of Public Service, in support of the City’s commitment to Vision Zero, would pilot a new “quick build” product with the goal of improving transportation safety and motorist compliance to the posted speed limit. If successful this product would have multiple applications to support future “quick build” projects and make improvements along High-Injury-Network roadways until such a time that larger capital projects can be implemented.\nFor this specific pilot project, the Department has selected Thurman Ave between S. Champion Ave and Lockbourne Rd. This funding allocation would support the purchase of the desired product and the contracting to install it.\nb.                     Mobility Hub Pilot Project(s)\nMobility Hubs provide a focal point in the transportation network that integrates and supports multi-modal transportation. Amenities can take many different forms based on desired goals and site limitations.\nThis funding allocation will support the collaborative efforts between the Department of Public Service and the office of Councilmember Barroso de Padilla to pilot mobility hub concepts at various locations. This allocation would provide the funding necessary for the purchase and installation of mobility hub elements. These elements could include but are not limited to: seating, traditional/enhanced bike racks, bike lockers, scooter parking, and public art/placemaking.\nAll bids will be obtained and contracts awarded in compliance with the relevant provisions of the Columbus City Code, Chapter 329.  This ordinance will set up all of the funding required to enter into contracts with multiple vendors on an as-needed basis. Competitive bids will be solicited and opened by the Department of Public Service and/or the Department of Finance and Management, Purchasing Office or obtained through current, pending or future universal term contracts established by Finance and Management.  \n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance will appropriate and transfer funds from the General Fund 1000, Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund 100018 to the Public Service General fund 1000, subfund 10001.
