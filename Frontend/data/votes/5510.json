    "description": "Explanation\nE-bikes are electric bicycles with a motor that gives riders a boost. E-bikes are a low-cost, energy efficient, climate-friendly form of transportation. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and travel up to 28 mph. When you use an e-bike to get around, you can: \n•                     Save thousands of dollars per year on fuel and maintenance by replacing daily car trips with e-bike rides \n•                     Bike greater distances and across harder terrain \n•                     Set aside worries about arriving sweaty at your destination \n•                     Reduce your carbon footprint while running errands or commuting to work\nIn addition to creating low-cost, affordable transportation, the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program is also providing climate-friendly transportation and will help Columbus reach our Climate Action Plan goals by reducing the carbon footprints in our community. \nThis program will provide vouchers for residents who are interested in purchasing an e-bike. Residents will need to apply for the program and once selected to receive a voucher, they would be able to redeem the voucher at the point of sale and the bike shop would in turn receive that money. \nAs a leader in the transportation and mobility space, Smart Columbus was chosen for their expertise and user-centric programmatic designs. As e-bike subsidy programs continue to grow nationwide, Smart Columbus' agile and collaborative innovation will be integral in advancing what is new and next at the intersection of transportation, technology, and community good.
