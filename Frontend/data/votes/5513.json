    "description": "Explanation\nIn the Fall of 2019, President Pro Tempore Elizabeth Brown, the Mayor’s Office, and the Columbus Women’s Commission were awarded a CityStart grant from Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFE Fund) supporting the creation of a Financial Empowerment Roadmap to help women and families achieve financial security.\n \nSince then, the city has partnered with CFE Fund on a variety of programs to support Columbus women’s and families’ financial stability. Most recently, the CFE Fund awarded Columbus a $150,000 grant for 2022 to plan and launch a Financial Empowerment Center (FEC). Additional funds supporting the Columbus FEC are anticipated for 2023.\n \nIn 2021, Columbus issued a Request for Proposals (RFQ019295) for the launch of a Financial Empowerment Center, and received two responsive proposals. An evaluation committee reviewed and scored both proposals and recommended that the Department of Development enter into contract with Jewish Family Services of Columbus (JFS).\n \nJFS hired and trained three financial counselors and planned a launch in collaboration with the Department of Development, President Pro Tempore Elizabeth Brown, and the Columbus Women’s Commission. The Financial Empowerment Center launched in April of 2022 and has grown to supporting over a hundred clients since then, helping Columbus residents pay down thousands of dollars in debt and to set aside even more in savings.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a non-profit services contract with Jewish Family Services of Columbus by extending the contract period to December 31, 2023, and to add an additional $240,000.00 to the existing contract, and to authorize the expenditure of $240,000.00.  \n \nColumbus City Council voted on December 6, 2021 to pass Ordinance Number 3272-2021, which authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a non-profit services contract with Jewish Family Services to plan the launch and of and operate a financial empowerment center in Columbus.  \n \nThis modification is needed to extend the contract period to December 31, 2023, and add $240,000.00 to the existing contract to allow Jewish Family Services of Columbus to continue to act as the Financial Counseling Provider for the Columbus Financial Empowerment Center.\n \nOriginal contract                     $300,000.00                     Ord. 3272-2021                                          PO318789\nMod 1                                                               $240,000.00                     \n                                                                                                                              $540,000.00\n \nJewish Family Services will continue to act as the Financial Counseling Provider to provide free, professional, one on one financial counseling services to Columbus residents as a municipal service. The funding provided will be used to retain three (3) financial counselors and one (1) program manager employed by Jewish Family Services for the provision of financial counseling services. The funding will also support marketing services and supplies to raise public awareness of the availability of these free financial counseling services. These services cannot be provided by current City employees at this time.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any lapse in the provision of services through the Financial Empowerment Center.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available through the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify and extend a non-profit service contract with Jewish Family Services of Columbus for the continued operation of the Financial Empowerment Center; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
