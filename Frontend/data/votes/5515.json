    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to execute contract modification No. 17 to the Organic Waste Processing Agreement between the City of Columbus (City) and Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC (Kurtz). \n \nContract modification No. 17 will be in effect from December 1, 2022 to and including November 30, 2023, and is the first iteration to not include the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO), which declined to renew the contract this year. The contract modification funds the following services and provisions:\n \nFixed Rate Sewerage Sludge Processing Term:\n \nThe contract continues a fixed rate fee of $33.50 per wet ton of sewerage sludge processing for the duration of this contract (10 years + 5 year extension). This contract authorizes the transfer to the organic waste recovery and reuse system of up to 25,000 wet tons of sewerage sludge per year at this rate. This contract provides DOSD with an additional beneficial alternative use option for sewerage sludge.\n \nLog Grinding:\n \nThe contract adds a provision to fund log grinding services utilizing funds originally intended for hauling incinerator ash as part of a beneficial reuse program at the City’s two wastewater treatment plants. Incinerator ash had been historically stored at the treatment plants in lagoons and land filled at considerable expense to DOSD. This program allowed for up to 5,000 tons of wastewater treatment incinerator ash a year to be removed and adapted for beneficial reuse at a rate of $30.97 per ton, which was less than the land filing cost to the City. However, in 2015, the City ceased incineration of sewerage sludge, and thus incinerator ash generation, prior to the end of the contract.\n \n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds:  The amount of additional funds needed for this contract is $1,587,500.00. The original contract was established without funding. The total City cost of the original contract and all modifications is $13,075,645.00.  This modification extends the contract period from December 1, 2022 through and including November 30, 2023.\n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  The need for additional funds was foreseen in the original contract. This legislation is to cover the funds budgeted for remainder of fiscal year 2022 through and including November 30, 2023 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes were not used:  This contract is for 10 years with a 5-year extension provided in the original contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.                     How cost was determined:  The cost, terms and conditions are in accordance with the original agreement as modified.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nKurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC | Federal EIN 20-3524137 | D365 Vendor #001253 | Expires 11/04/2024 | Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$837,500.00 was budgeted for this modification. The Compost section budgeted for two other biosolids contracts that will not be encumbered this year, so there is enough funding available to cover the contract's additional log grinding provision.\n \n$626,441.05 has been spent year-to-date in 2022\n$969,699.51 was spent in 2021                     \n$1,165,070.53 was spent in 2020\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to avoid a lapse in organic waste hauling services. Passage of non-emergency legislation would result in a gap between the end of the current contract iteration and the start of this proposed modification. Negotiations over new contract terms, delayed in part because of the change from a three-party to a two-party agreement, have delayed the submission of legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify, extend and increase an agreement with Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC for the design, construction and operation of the Organic Waste Recovery and Reuse System Project; to authorize the expenditure of $1,587,500.00 from the Sewer Operating Sanitary Fund; and to declare an emergency.
