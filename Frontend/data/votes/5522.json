    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a grant agreement with National Church Residences, in an amount up to $1,900,000.00, for the Clover Glen project.\n \nOriginal grant amount                     $1,000,000.00                     Ord. 1839-2022                                          PO353882\nMod 1 grant amount                     $1,900,000.00\nTotal grant amount                     $2,900,000.00\n \nOrdinance 1839-2022, passed by City Council on July 20, 2022, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) for the Project.  The HDA stated that the city would provide up to $2,900,000.00 over two years through two payments of $1,000,000.00 and $1,900,000.00.  The first installment was authorized under Ordinance 1839-2022. This grant agreement modification is the second and final payment for the Project.  \n \nNational Church Residences proposes Clover Glen, formally, West Broad Senior, a 92-unit, affordable housing community for seniors aged 55+ located at 5719 W Broad Street in Columbus, Franklin County. Clover Glen serves the unique and growing aging, low income population in Ohio. This senior housing community will offer 92 one-bedroom units with approximately 20 units affordable to residents at or below 30% AMI, 72 units affordable to residents at 60% AMI.\n \nResidents at Clover Glen will benefit from an amenity-rich location with easy access to health care services, grocery stores, and senior services. Of particular note, the property is within walking distance of the Prairie Township Community Center which offers a pool, fitness center, walking path, and seasonal farmer's market, in addition to hosting programming specifically for seniors including adult education opportunities. Residents will also have walking access to dental care, eye care, grocery shopping, park with walking trail, place of worship, pharmacy, dining, salon, bank, and bus service.\n \nThe National Church Residences Home for Life service model was developed as an enhanced delivery approach that will ensure a comprehensive network of services is offered to seniors at the property allowing them to remain happy, healthy and independent for as long as possible. This robust program is backed by central office support staff and presents a holistic, person centered supportive services experience that extends far beyond traditional service coordination. Residents will also benefit from National Church Residences existing preferred partnerships and have access to CareGuide, the organization’s online, evidenced-based population health management tool to assess resident needs. CareGuide allows for the tracking of tenant metrics to better recognize patterns that can aide in designing targeted programming while also being proactive in assisting to help prevent avoidable and costly resident hospitalizations. These resources will assist the property staff in developing the enriched service program best suited for resident needs.\n \nClover Glen will consist of one building with 92 one-bedroom apartments units. Each unit will have a separate kitchen, bathroom, living area, and bedroom. At least five of the units will meet Section 504 accessibility standards. In addition, National Church Residences will incorporate building design features to enable residents to age in place including but not limited to accessible means of egress/ingress for each unit, 36” door widths, lever handles, and facets, clear floor space of 30” x 50”, and accessible locations of lighting and environmental controls. The building will also incorporate sustainable design practices and methods in accordance with OHFA’s Green Policy.\n \nClover Glen has closed its financing with the exception of the second round of City capital funds and is currently under construction with completion planned in Fall of 2023.\n \nEmergency action is requested to maintain the closing schedule of the project and to mitigate construction cost increases.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $1,900,000.00 in the Affordable Housing Taxable Bond Fund.
