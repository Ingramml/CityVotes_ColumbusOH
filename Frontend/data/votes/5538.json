    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance amends Chapter 211 of the Columbus City Codes by enacting section 211.07 to establish the Office of Violence Prevention within the Office of the Mayor.\n \nThe Office of Violence Prevention will empower community partners and city departments to increase public safety, prevent violence, and promote healing through holistic, equity based, and trauma-informed approaches for the benefit of all who live and spend time in Columbus. The Office of Violence Prevention will provide oversight of these strategies such as violence interruption, case management, employment assistance, fellowship opportunities, and hospital-based violence interventions that are all in use by the Office and/or the City. The Office will provide grants to CBOs, provide direct services with OVP staff, coordinate violence prevention activities, support policy development, and conduct research. Most importantly, the Office of Violence Prevention will serve as a hub for the reduction of gun violence through research, legislation and coordination with the Columbus Department of Public Health and other agencies.
