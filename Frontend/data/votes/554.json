The contract language allows for the Department of Public Utilities to renew the contract for three (3) additional years based upon mutual agreement of the parties, availability of budgeted funds, and approval by City Council.  If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.  This proposed renewal #3 is for year 4 of the contract.  The contract will be extended through April 1, 2022.\n \nSUPPLIER:  K&M Kleening Service, Inc.
