    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance amends the Management Compensation Plan, Ordinance No. 2713-2013, as amended, by adjusting the pay structure by one and nine-tenths percent (1.9%) to remain market competitive.  It also adjusts the 50-60 pay structure in order to pay employees appropriately who would otherwise be assigned to a union.  Adjusting the pay structure will require that any employee currently at the minimum pay rate for each pay grade will be increased by one and nine-tenths percent (1.9%) or any amount below the new minimum of the assigned pay structure.  Any cost associated with these adjustments will be absorbed by the respective department budgets.  This ordinance also modifies the pay range of the Law Clerk (U) (1988) by assigning it to Pay Grade 86.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the Management Compensation Plan, Ordinance No. 2713-2013, as amended, by amending Section 4(B), Section 4(D), and Section 5(D); and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the Management Compensation Plan to increase the pay structures to remain market competitive; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the pay range of the Law Clerk (U) (1988) by assigning it to Pay Grade 86; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City in that it is immediately necessary to amend certain provisions of the Management Compensation Plan, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; Now, Therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSee Attachment",
