    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health’s Environmental Health Division has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $150,000.00 in grant money to fund the Water Pollution Control grant program, for the period April 30, 2021 through November 30, 2022.\n \nThe Water Pollution Control program was created to assist the residents of Ohio with the repair or replacement of failing septic systems in hopes to improve the overall water quality in the state.  The program is providing financial assistance to low to moderate income homeowners with the repair or replacement of failing systems. Columbus Public Health will solicit and identify local homeowners in Columbus that meet the income eligibility criteria outlined in the program.  Columbus Public Health hopes to identify and repair/replace approximately 20 systems within the City of Columbus.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so the identification of septic system can begin immediately and to use all funds allocated to this program.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The Water Pollution Control grant program is entirely funded by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and does not generate revenue or require a City Match.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in the amount of $150,000.00 for the Water Pollution Control grant program, to begin efforts to identify and replace/repair failing septic systems within the City of Columbus; to authorize the appropriation of $150,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($150,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $150,000.00 in grant funds have been made available through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the Water Pollution Control program for the period of April 30, 2021 through November 30, 2022; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to begin efforts to identify and replace/repair failing septic systems within the City of Columbus; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and to appropriate these funds to Columbus Public Health for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare, and to avoid delay in client services; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $150,000.00 from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the Water Pollution Control program for the period April 30, 2021 through November 30, 2022.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department's Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources during the grant period, the sum of $150,000.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated upon receipt of an executed grant agreement to the Health Department, Division No. 5001, according to the attached accounting document.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except upon voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.  At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  Funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
