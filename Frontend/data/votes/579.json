This project is a response to several public requests for Tuttle Park improvements during the 2019 University District Plan Process. During the design phase, the Department coordinated with the Tuttle Community Recreation Center, University Area Commission, and other support groups to identify and prioritize park improvements. As a result, this construction contract will repair the existing futsal and tennis courts, relocate a new full size basketball court, improve park lighting, plant 31 trees, and provide a new amenity area. The new amenity area will include an open shelter, benches, picnic tables, bike racks, and a water bottle refill station. Additionally, this contract will build an ADA Accessible route to the lower fields from Oakland Avenue and Tuttle Recreation Center by removing a staircase and creating an ADA Compliant ramp. With an anticipated April 2021 start date, this contract will enable the Tuttle Park Lower Field Improvements Project to be constructed at the same time as the Tuttle Skatepark Project, recently authorized by 0331-2021, with the goal that they both be completed by December 2021.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on February 3, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 23, 2021.
