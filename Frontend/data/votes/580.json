    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance is to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Trinity Transition Consultants LLC (TTC), to provide support services in developing sustainable, diverse, equitable, inclusive and anti-racist workplace culture that reflects the Departments core values, mission, and vision; to authorize the expenditure of $339,300.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285; \n \nBackground: TTC will work closely with the Departments Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee (Committee) to strategically elevate the Committee and the work of the Committee with staff and with our community. \n \nAs part of the overall contract, TTC is proposing the following, five (5) prong approach:\n \n(1) Healing Humanity Project TM - Employee Group Sessions are designed to create a safe space for Columbus Recreation & Parks Department (CRPD) employees to share their thoughts, feelings, and bear witness to social and racial injustices, discrimination, and how it affects them.  The sessions will allow us to surface the truth that a White person and Black Indigenous Person of Color (BIPOC)/Person of Color (POC) placed in the same environment may be having totally different experiences.\n \n(2) The Enneagram and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Anti-Racism: Leadership Team Workshops\nThere is intentional work that is needed in order to embrace diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism through our 9 different lenses. The Enneagram brilliantly illuminates this work.  The Columbus Recreation & Parks Department (CRPD) leadership team will learn how to be allies and advocate for all employees in the workplace by:  \n \n(3) Living Our Vision: A Socially Equitable City\nTrinity Transition Consultants (TTC) will create an awareness around shared language and communication disconnects as it pertains to the CRPD's vision, mission, core values and practices for an inclusive and diverse workplace. Consultants will clarify the understanding of the core values based on individual perspectives, moving towards a shared, collective understanding. This collective understanding is how an organization moves away from core values on paper to the embodiment of core values in the organization.\n \n(4) Executive Coaching Executive coaching involves the development of individual self-awareness that will build on acknowledged strengths and remediation of recognized areas of challenge. Trinity Transition Consultants work with clients to help them to develop alignment between their core values and the core values of the organization. This helps to cultivate more productive workplace relationships with peers, direct reports and staff.  \n \n(5) C.A.N.D.L.E TM- Cultural. Allies. Network. for Diversity. Learning. Experiences\nWork with CRPD human resources to identify employees who choose to be cultural allies and provide learning experiences each month on anti-racism and across the broad spectrum of diversity.  Over time, a pool of potential C.A.N.D.L.E facilitators will be identified and engaged in building internal capacity to continue the work within CRPD.
