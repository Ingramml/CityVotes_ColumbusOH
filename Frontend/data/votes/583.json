    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing engineering agreement with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. for the Blueprint Hilltop 4 Highland/Harris Integrated Solutions Project. It is the objective of the City to mitigate DSRs (Designed Sewer Relief) overflows throughout the City’s collection system to the 10-year level of service.  The City will evaluate and determine if this is best accomplished by eliminating inflow and infiltration into sanitary sewers, and constructing green infrastructure to retain and treat the resulting storm water.  \n \nCommunity Planning Area: 53 - Greater Hilltop\n \nRenewal Information:     \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $ 1,198,723.97\n        Original Contract                                          $ 2,000,862.80\n                     Renewal #1                                          $ 1,198,723.97\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                          $ 3,199,586.77\n \n1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen.\nThis modification was anticipated.\n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nSubstantial information and knowledge has been developed by the consultant through work performed during the first three years of work on this engineering agreement.  If the work to be performed under this modification was to be bid out separately, tasks already completed would be performed repetitively causing significant delays and incurring additional cost.  Also delays would put the City at risk of missing consent order deadlines.\n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nA scope of services, consistent with the original proposal and contract, was developed and fee was negotiated between the City and consultant.\n \nPROJECT TIMELINE: It is anticipated that this modification will be for a term of 2 years.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n    \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE No.:  31-0922991 | MAJ | Exp. 4/30/2021 | Vendor # 004467\n \nECONOMIC IMPACT: This project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the neighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $1,198,723.97 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109 and amends the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing engineering agreement with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. for the Blueprint Hilltop 4 Highland/Harris Integrated Solutions Project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,198,723.97 in funds from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund; and to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget. ($1,198,723.97)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is the objective of the City to mitigate Designed Sewer Relief overflows throughout the City’s collection system to the 10-year level of service; and\n \nWHEREAS, the objective of this project will include all the requisite evaluation, formulation, and design to produce fully independent construction documents for the remediation of inflow and infiltration (I/I), green infrastructure (GI) technologies, and other related activities and/or documents necessary for project completion; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,198,723.97 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Fund, Fund 6109; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget to provide sufficient authority for the above mentioned project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing engineering agreement with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. in connection with the Blueprint Hilltop 4 Highland/Harris Integrated Solutions Project for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify an existing professional engineering service agreement with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc., 1650 Watermark Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43215, for the Blueprint Hilltop 4 Highland/Harris Integrated Solutions Project in accordance with the terms and conditions as shown in the contract on file in the office of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSection 2. That the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget is amended per the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the Director is hereby authorized to expend up to $1,198,723.97 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109 per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That said company, Korda/Nemeth Engineering Inc., shall conduct the work to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Utilities and the Administrator of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project account by monies from more than one source.\n \nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 7.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 8.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
