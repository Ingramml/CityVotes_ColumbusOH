    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into grant agreements with various social service agencies in support of the Cleaner Columbus Employment Program.\n \nAccording to a July 2020 study on the impact of COVID-19 in major US cities, more than half of residents reported experiencing serious financial problems. In 2020, the Cleaner Columbus Employment Program offered residents in five neighborhoods the opportunity to have temporary employment performing neighborhood beautification and cleanup. The funding provided temporary assistance due to financial hardship experienced because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The three-week initiative was a resounding success. Residents collected 5,789 bags of litter and debris for a total weight of 173,670 lbs. That is 53 percent of the total weight of litter and debris collected in all of 2019.  \n \nJust as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact the workforce, the need for economic assistance remains. The Cleaner Columbus Employment Program will continue to offer employment opportunities to residents by paying $15 per hour. Community partners soliciting temporary workers will prioritize enrolling residents that have experienced employment disruption.cohorts in 2021\n \nThe Cleaner Columbus Employment Program will host three different cohorts in 2021. The social service agencies listed below are for the Spring and Summer cohort. The social service agencies for the Fall cohort have yet to be identified.
