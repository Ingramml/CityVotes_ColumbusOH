    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize the Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resource Center for their 50 years of Service to the Columbus Community\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center (CRC) was founded in 1971 by a group of Clintonville residents who evaluated the needs of the Clintonville/Beechwold area and realized that neighbors could help neighbors; and\n \nWHEREAS, The CRC was initially supported by a contribution from the congregation of North Broadway United Methodist Church, and other area churches quickly added their support. CRC's Choice Food Pantry has grown tremendously as the staff and leadership continue to develop programs to serve community needs; and\n                 \nWHEREAS, As part of the century-old settlement house movement, CRC is a community-based social services agency guided by the core values of justice, adaptability, efficiency, engagement, and dignity; and\n \nWHEREAS, The CRC has expanded their community programs to include family services, a kinship care program, senior supportive services, and youth services (kids club); and \n \nWHEREAS, The key to the CRC's success in providing community-based services are the dedicated staff members, who approach patrons with compassion and understanding; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby recognize the Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resource Center for their 50 years of Service to the Columbus Community.",
