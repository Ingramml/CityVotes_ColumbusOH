    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with Purchase Agreement (UTC) PA005016 for Harris and Heavener Excavating, Inc. It also authorizes the expenditure of up to $150,000.00 for fiber restoration services. \n \nOn October 20, 2020, the Department of Finance’s Purchasing Office published RFQ016487 to solicit quotes for a new universal term contract/purchase agreement for fiber optic maintenance services. There were two respondents to this solicitation: The Fishel Company and Harris and Heavener, Excavating, Inc. Following an evaluation of the bids, it was determined that the offer submitted by Harris and Heavener was the most responsible, responsive, and best offer. The contract, authorized by ordinance 0005-2021 and awarded to Harris and Heavener, expires on December 31, 2023.\n \nThe Department of Technology requires these services as part of its ongoing fiber maintenance program. The city owns hundreds of miles of fiber optic cabling in various strand count quantities throughout the city, with additional miles going into service annually. Routine inspection and maintenance service help keep the system in optimal condition. Additionally, starting in 2016, the State of Ohio mandated participation in the Ohio Utilities Protection Service (OUPS), which requires that cable locates occur prior to digging of any kind.  \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $150,000.00 for the above-mentioned services. The term of the purchase order that results from passage of this ordinance will be one year from the date of its approval and confirmation by the City Auditor’s Office.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency designation is requested so that the services described herein are available at the beginning of the construction season.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the services outlined in this ordinance are budgeted and available in the Information Services 2021 operating budget.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor:  Harris and Heavener Excavating, Inc.\nCC#:  31-1466823, Expires 3-12-2022\nDAX#: 017728\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the Purchase Agreement for Harris and Heavener Excavating, Inc. for fiber maintenance and restoration services; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
