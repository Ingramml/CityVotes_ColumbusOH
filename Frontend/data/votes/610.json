    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC for Licensed Landfill Services for the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program.\n \nOriginal Contract Amount                     $45,000.00                     PO224895\nRenewal No 1                                                               $20,000.00                     Ord. 0173-2021                                          PO TBD\nModification No. 1                                          $         0.00\nTotal Contract Amount                                          $65,000.00\n                     \nIn March 2020, the department advertised RFQ015150 on vendor services.  During a recent review of invoices, it was discovered that the solicitation did not include all the necessary prices for disposal of municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste.  The bid specification asked only for the tipping fee price and did not ask for the environmental fee cost.  The vendor billed us for both, and we paid for both, but this fee is not included in the contract even though it is a required cost of doing business.\n \nThe contract modification would approve payment of the environmental fee in the 2020 contract and would allow the contract renewal for 2021 (authorized under ordinance 0173-2021) to be modified to include payment of the additional environmental fee.  \n \nThe purpose of the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program is to provide abatement of high grass, weeds, and solid waste removal on specifically designated, privately owned property where the City has determined it necessary to take action pursuant to Columbus City Code Section 701.19.  The department hires contractors to provide these services and then contracts directly with a licensed landfill to receive the material removed by the contractors.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this modification.   \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 009867 and expires 3/11/23.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC for Licensed Landfill Services for the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to modify a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC to allow for payment of environmental fees in the 2020 and 2021 contracts; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ015150 on Vendor Services in March 2020, one bid was received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with the bidder under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify this contract in order to continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify a contract with Republic Waste of Ohio, LLC to allow for payment of environmental fees in the 2020 and 2021 contracts for Licensed Landfill Services for the Division of Code Enforcement’s Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
