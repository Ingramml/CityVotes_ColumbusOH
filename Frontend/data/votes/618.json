    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify three emergency shelter repair agreements with Southeast Inc by extending the agreement termination date of each from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021. \n \nThe city entered into three separate agreements for the repairs to be made at one location:  924 E. Main Street, Columbus, Ohio 43025.\n \nThe first agreement was authorized under ordinance 2997-2018 (PO152999), the second agreement was authorized under ordinance 2398-2019 (PO196106), and the third agreement was authorized under ordinance 2819-2019 (PO208904).  This time extension for each agreement will allow Southeast Inc to fully complete emergency shelter repairs of real property located at 924 E Main St, Columbus, OH 43205. \n \nOne of the impacts of COVID-19 was the quarantine period in which the Southeast Inc could not get a company in the building to work.  Southeast Inc’s ability to complete the bathroom renovation and life safety items tied to shelter capacity expansion has been affected by unanticipated delays due to difficulty in getting contractors to work at the shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The original general contractor hired to complete the work abandoned the job and Southeast Inc had to identify and hire multiple independent contractors to complete various aspects of the work. Currently repairs are in progress. \n \nEmergency action is requested to meet the project schedule.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are needed for these modifications.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004491 and expires 10/2/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify three emergency shelter repair agreements with Southeast Inc by extending the agreement termination dates from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to modify three agreements with Southeast Inc for emergency repairs at 924 E Main St., Columbus, Ohio 43205 by extending the agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification supports the purpose of Southeast Inc fully completing emergency shelter repairs of real property located at 924 E Main St., Columbus, OH 43205; and\n \nWHEREAS, no additional funds are needed to modify this agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to modify the agreement with Southeast Inc to meet the project schedule, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify three agreements with Southeast Inc for emergency shelter repairs located at 924 E. Main St., Columbus, Ohio 43205 by extending the agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
