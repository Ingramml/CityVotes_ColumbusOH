    "description": "Title\n \nTo Designate April 2023 as “National Fair Housing Month” within the City of Columbus\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Fair Housing Month celebrates the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968; and \n \nWHEREAS, the purpose of the Fair Housing Act was to put an end to inequities within the housing system and eliminate racial segregation in American neighborhoods; and\n \nWHEREAS, the law prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, and requires Federal, State, and local governments to proactively dismantle the discriminatory structures that hold back people of color and underserved populations from equitable access to the neighborhoods of their choice; and\n \nWHEREAS, historical legacies of discriminatory housing policies are still evident within Ohio, with 33% and 31% of Black and Hispanic renters respectively experiencing severe housing problems compared to only 23% of white renters. \n \nWHEREAS, today, Columbus, Ohio continues to grapple with the immense wealth gap that promotes social, racial, and economic disparities across neighborhoods; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus aims to increase awareness of fair housing issues, eliminate intolerance and biased behavior among individuals and groups working in the housing space, and work towards ensuring equitable access to safe and affordable housing; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is committed to securing equal opportunity for all, as well as providing encouragement to those whose housing needs have yet to be realized; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus commits itself to pave the way for all home seekers to be adequately housed and to make our city an even better place in which to live, now therefore:\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council and designates April 2023 as “National Fair Housing Month” in the City of Columbus, and encourages Columbus residents to observe the month with appropriate awareness and educational activities.",
