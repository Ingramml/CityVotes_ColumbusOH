    "description": "Title\nTo recognize April 10-16, 2023 as Food Waste Prevention Week in the City of Columbus, Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is estimated that as much as 40 percent of the food supply in the United States goes uneaten and almost 95 percent of wasted food is disposed in landfills and incinerators where it represents the largest component of disposed municipal solid waste; and\n \nWHEREAS, food waste disposed of in landfills emits methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change; and\n \nWHEREAS, the natural resources used to produce food, such as energy, land, and water, also are wasted when food is thrown away; and\n \nWHEREAS, 13% of Columbus adults and children are food-insecure and, therefore, do not have a reliable source of food to support a healthy and active lifestyle; and\n \nWHEREAS, the average American family wastes an average of approximately $1,800 worth of food per year; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Climate Action Plan has a goal of reducing 95% of organic material going to the landfill by 2050; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus and Franklin County Local Food Action Plan identifies the prevention of food-related waste through increased consumer education, household composting, technical assistance to food businesses and regulatory updates that support food waste diversion; and\n \nWHEREAS, reducing the amount of food going to waste and diverting it from disposal mitigates climate change, conserves natural resources, feeds hungry Columbus residents, saves money, and produces beneficial products such as soil amendment and energy; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby declare its commitment to reducing food waste as part of the city’s Climate Action Plan and recognizes the week of April 10-16, 2023 as Food Waste Prevention Week in the City of Columbus, Ohio.",
