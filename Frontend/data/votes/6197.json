    "title": "To agree to an adjustment to the City’s boundaries by consenting to transfer approximately 0.5+/- acres from the City of Columbus to the City of Worthington.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nA boundary adjustment between the City of Columbus and the City of Worthington has been proposed. The site is on the east side of Worthington-Galena Road, north of Huntley Road and south of the Interstate 270 overpass, and consists entirely of right of way. The proposed adjustment moves the City of Columbus corporate boundary slightly eastward, to exclude the right of way.
