    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a service contract with ParkMobile LLC in the amount of up to $800,000.00 for the Mobile Payment Application System contract.\n \nThe purpose of this contract is to continue to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, Division of Parking Services with a ParkColumbus mobile payment application powered by ParkMobile. The Division of Parking Services launched the ParkColumbus mobile payment application in 2019 in the Short North and has since expanded the application city-wide to pay for all on-street paid public parking. The intent of this contract is to provide the City of Columbus, Division of Parking Services, additional resources that are necessary to perform various technical tasks for the Mobile Payment Application System.  The contractor will provide resources for maintenance and support of hardware and web-based software for citation issuance and management, Mobile LPR technology, and residential, employee and guest permitting programs, and other items as outlined in the scope of services listed in the request for proposal on behalf of the City.\nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against ParkMobile LLC.\n \n2.  REQUEST FOR SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT\nThe Division of Parking Services launched the ParkColumbus mobile payment application in 2019 in the Short North and has since expanded the application city-wide for all on-street paid public parking.  This application was a part of another contract expiring soon, and the prime contractor will not be awarded a contract extension.  As ParkMobile LLC has the experience, expertise and equipment to maintain and support the Mobile Payment Application System as they have provided this service since 2019,  the Department of Public Service requests that this contract be awarded through the sole source provision of Columbus City Code Section 329.19(e).\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for ParkMobile LLC is CC030903, which expired on October 4, 2021, and will need to be renewed with Vendor Services.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for the first year of this contract is available within Fund 6500, the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund.  Funding for subsequent years will be modified as needed based on budget authority and council approval.\n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is for the Mobile Payment Application System, which was developed and implemented prior to the start of the MBE/WBE program and thus is exempt from this program.\n \n6. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so an appropriate transition period is available to allow for the replacement of the original prime contractor whose contract is expiring and will not be renewed the new service contract with ParkMobile LLC to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with ParkMobile LLC for the Mobile Payment Application System in accordance with the sole source provision of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of up to $800,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund to pay for the first year of this contract; and to declare an emergency. ($800,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, there is a need to enter into a professional services contract to provide for the implementation, maintenance and continued operation of the Mobile Payment Application System; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize a waiver of the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes to continue the Mobile Payment Application System program; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to enter into a contract with ParkMobile LLC for the provision of professional services described above in the amount of up to $800,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $800,000.00 for the first year of this contract from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund to pay for the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with ParkMobile LLC in order to provide funding for the first year of this contract for the Mobile Payment Application System contract so that an appropriate transition period is available to allow for the replacement of the original prime contractor whose contract is expiring and will not be renewed the new service contract with ParkMobile LLC to ensure the safety of the traveling public, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Service be, and hereby is, authorized to enter into a professional services contract with ParkMobile LLC of 1100 Spring Street NW, Suite 200, Atlanta, GA 30309, for the Mobile Payment Application System contract in an amount up to $800,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2.  That City Council finds it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to award this contract in accordance with the sole source provision of Columbus City Code, Section 329.19(e).\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $800,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 6500 (Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund), Subfund 650001 (Mobility Enterprise), , Dept-Div 5906 (Public Service - Parking Services), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
