    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND:\nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, is engaged in the Traffic Signal Installation - Columbus Traffic Signal System (CTSS) Phase F project which is the sixth phase in a series of projects to migrate all Columbus traffic signals to a new central traffic control system.  This will allow the city to choose among multiple vendors for some of the commodities related to the Traffic Signal System and ideally receive better pricing for needed materials.\n \nIn the course of affecting the Traffic Signal Installation - Columbus Traffic Signal System (CTSS) Phase F project, it is sometimes necessary to force the relocation of utilities from privately held easements. These relocations are in areas where the city has previously allowed utilities, but due to this project there is a need to relocate them at the city's expense. Utility relocation estimates are normally included in the budget for each project, but occasionally estimates are insufficient and not always in the city's control. Ordinance 2158-2021 authorized an initial $350,000.00 for utility relocations.  \n \nThis ordinance will authorize an additional $250,000.00 due to the need for more Joint Use work pole replacements.  This will also allow the ability to attach to AT&T, Columbus Southern and AEP facilities.  These additional funds will be used for the engineering, make ready work, and inspections after City infrastructure is installed.  Facility owners invoice for the costs of this work. The Joint Use engineering and make ready work will continue through 2023 and the inspections will continue through 2024.  This modification was anticipated based on the number of final pole attachments and impact of inflation since the original legislation passed in 2021.  \n \nThe $250,000.00 requested for this work is an estimate. Legislation requesting additional funds will be submitted for Council’s approval if the estimate should be short of the actual expenses.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds in the amount of $250,000.00 are available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, of the Department of Public Service’s 2022 Capital Improvement Budget. A transfer of appropriation is necessary to establish funding in the proper project.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is being requested to keep project construction on schedule because Joint Use proposals are being returned and the City needs to review, comment, and then approve. The utilities will not begin any work until payment is received which will impact the schedule.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to reimburse various utilities for utility relocation costs incurred in conjunction with the Columbus Traffic Signal System Phase F project; to authorize the expenditure of $250,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bonds Fund to pay for the utility relocation costs; and to declare an emergency.
