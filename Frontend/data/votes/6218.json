    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Applied Geographics to provide professional services associated with the Urban Tree Canopy Assessment 2022 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $15,000.00.\n \nColumbus faces many challenges today and over the coming decades. Trees are part of the solution. Trees help reduce urban stressors, cleaning our air, providing shade, intercepting stormwater, and more. The benefits urban trees provide is valued up to five times what it costs to maintain them. In Columbus, our trees provide $38 million in benefits each year. However, our tree canopy is vulnerable to threats from disease, pests, the changing climate and increased development. Also, the City is expecting to grow by 1 million residents in the coming decades. To improve our residents’ quality of life, The City of Columbus approved the Columbus Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP) in April 2021. The UFMP is the first Citywide, strategic plan to invest long-term in Columbus’ trees. Over the next decades, the UFMP will guide the entire Columbus community to prioritize, preserve and grow our tree canopy. \n \nThe UFMP has ambitious canopy goals requiring frequent benchmarking. The first and only Urban Tree Canopy Assessment of Columbus’ trees was based on 2013 data and found that 22% of Columbus is covered with trees. This canopy cover is lower than many of Columbus’ peer cities. The UFMP recommends obtaining and regularly updating key forestry data, including the Urban Tree Canopy Assessment. As part of UFMP implementation, Columbus needs an updated canopy assessment to measure change since 2013. Additionally, a more comprehensive assessment of the entire county, along with those municipalities neighboring Columbus, is critical to understanding the urban forest on a regional level.\n \nBy modifying this contract, the City will receive additional deliverables that were not included in the original scope, including two presentations to City and County leadership, 41 County jurisdiction presentations, 41 fact sheets for Columbus Communities, and 41 Columbus Communities presentations. The additional $15,000.00 needed to modify the contract has been contributed by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office, as part of a cooperative agreement authorized by Ordinance 2512-2022. This additional work is a continuation of the fact sheets and reporting that the consultant is already providing as part of the original scope.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nApplied Geographics Inc.\n33 Broad Street, 4th Floor\nBoston, Massachusetts 02109\nBrian Coolidge, (617) 447-2422                                                    \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 040369, 04-3124927\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 23, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the project is in the reporting phase and there is a need to avoid delays in the completion of the additional deliverables so they can be presented to leaders across the City and the County jurisdictions. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Understanding the updated tree canopy cover analysis in the City of Columbus and Franklin County will allow stakeholders and leaders to make decisions based on its current spread, where canopy could potentially increase, and how it has changed over time. The data from this report and the fact sheets will inform other UFMP projects such as the creation of private tree protections from development.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: On March 4, 2020, over 135 residents attended the “Let’s Talk Trees” public open house to provide input on the Urban Forestry Master Plan. One of the ways they could provide feedback was placing dots on a map where they wanted to see trees planted. Additionally, over 300 residents responded to an online comment form in 2020. Many comments referred to the management of public trees and the need for additional tree plantings. Many stakeholders commented on the need for update tree canopy information and a trends analysis, which is being accomplished in this project.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the City’s natural resources and overall environmental health, benefiting current and future generations.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $122,910.00 was legislated for the Urban Tree Canopy Assessment 2022 Project by Ordinance 2040-2021. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $15,000.00. $15,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund 2223, Green Projects Subfund 222355 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $137,910.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Applied Geographics to provide professional services associated with the Urban Tree Canopy Assessment 2022 Project; to authorize the expenditure of $15,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Special Purpose Fund; and to declare an emergency.
