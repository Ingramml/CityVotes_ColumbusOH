    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Michael Baker International to provide professional services associated with the Alum Creek Trail Connections - Mock Road and Sunbury Drive Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $190,090.00.\n \nThe Alum Creek Trail - Mock Road Connector will become a direct 1.2 mile connection for the near northeast community to the City’s regional trail system. The connector will be a 10 foot wide paved path from the Alum Creek Trail at Sunbury and Mock Road, heading west and connecting directly to the new Hudson Street Greenway. This will open a seamless 3.5 mile east-west trail from Interstate 71 to the Alum Creek Trail. By linking these two east-west projects, over 6,000 residents of the Arlington Park, Woodland Holt, Brittany Hills, Argyle Park, and East Linden neighborhoods will be within 10 minutes of walking and biking connectivity to parks, churches, schools, retail, and jobs. It will also be near the proposed Community Sports Park at Mock Park. The Alum Creek Trail - Sunbury Drive Connector will link trail users from the Alum Creek Trail to Sunbury Drive and Sunbury Road, ultimately connecting to a private development proposed shared use path off Agler Road. This connection will further extend the reaches of the greenway network to the northeast area neighborhoods. \n \nIn February of 2020, the Recreation and Parks Department applied for Clean Ohio Trail Funds, through the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), to build a trail connection to the Alum Creek Trail from Mock Road for the near northeast area of Columbus. In March of 2021, the Department received notice that the grant was approved. This grant will be used on the construction phase of this project. \n \nBy modifying this contract, Michael Baker International will be able to complete the design and right of way plans for the Mock Road Connector Trail and Sunbury Drive Connector Projects. This modification was planned during initial project scoping with the consultant. For the Sunbury Drive scope of work, the City was unsure of the final alignment for the project. The original contract included schematic design with three design alternatives to help the City determine the most cost effective alignment. This modification covers detailed design and plan completion for the Sunbury Drive Project. For the Mock Road scope of work, there were unanticipated scope changes that arose during stage one design that requires additional scope from the consultant. These scope changes include an alignment change required by the Department of Public Service, the addition of sheet piling retaining wall design, and additional Division of Power lighting relocation redesign. The modification also involves additional utility coordination, survey, and right of way work. The consultant team, led by Michael Baker International, has managed the project thus far and is most familiar with project details. The current consultant team will most efficiently complete the additional work. The consultant provided additional hours they would need to complete the additional work. The contract has established hourly rates that were used to determine the price for the modification.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMichael Baker Jr. Inc. DBA Michael Baker International Inc.\n250 West Street, Suite 420\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nSonja Simpson, (614) 538-7627, Sonja.simpson@mbakerintl.com\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 001926, 25-1228638\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: December 1, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order complete the design plans and bid the construction project on schedule, meeting the grant funding deadline and coordinating with the Department of Public Utility’s sanitary sewer project which will be constructed at the same time as this project.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The near northeast area of Columbus lacks safe open spaces and parks. Designing a greenway trail along Mock Road to the city’s new Hudson Street Greenway and designing a greenway trail connecting Alum Creek to Sunbury Drive ties directly to the City’s goal of providing a lift to inner city neighborhoods cut off from safe access to greenways and outdoor experiences. Additionally, four schools, seven churches, three markets, a 100 acre park, an athletic complex, a senior living facility, and a child care facility are located along the 1.2 mile Mock Road Corridor.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Letters of support were received from non-profit organizations, residents, a school principal, and the Central Ohio Greenways Board. Further public engagement occurred during fall of 2022 through a public open house, online survey, area commission meetings, and social media blasts.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northeast (41), North Central (49)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It provides equitable and safe access to the trail system for underserved communities. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $562,481.00 was legislated for the Alum Creek Trail Connections - Mock Road and Sunbury Drive Project by Ordinance 0166-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $190,090.00. $190,090.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $752,571.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Michael Baker International to provide professional services associated with the Alum Creek Trail Connections - Mock Road and Sunbury Drive Project; to authorize the transfer of $190,090.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $190,090.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
