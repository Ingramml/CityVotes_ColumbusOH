    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Jess Howard Electric Company for the Solar Lighting 2022 Phase 2 Project. The contract amount is $187,000.00, with a contingency of $25,000.00, for a total of $212,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Solar Lighting 2022 Phase 2 Project seeks to provide solar site lighting to deter crime and increase the levels of safety and security in our parks. This solar lighting is also energy efficient and environmentally conscious. Dodge, New Beginnings, Driving, and Saunders Parks are proposed to receive these solar lights. There currently is not any functional solar lighting at Dodge or New Beginnings Park, contributing to a less than ideal environment for the park visitors and staff when it comes to safety. Driving Park and Saunders Park have solar site lighting along the walking path from previous solar lighting programs. This project will provide additional solar lighting along these paths, enhancing the security and safety of staff and park users at these locations. These projects are anticipated to begin in April 2023 and be substantially complete by November 2023.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on December 2, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on January 10, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nJess Howard Electric Company (MAJ): $187,000.00\nProline Electric (MAJ): $189,395.00\nEvolved Lighting Solutions (MAJ): $252,000.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Jess Howard Electric Company was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Jess Howard Electric Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nJess Howard Electric Company, Co. \n6630 Taylor Road\nBlacklick, Ohio 43068                                                      \nJonathon Howard, (614) 861-1300                                       \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006108, 31-4405752\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 18, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to complete the installation of the solar lights to improve the safety and security of these parks for the immediate preservation of public safety.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The addition of solar site lighting at Driving, Dodge, New Beginnings, and Saunders Parks will increase the safety and security of these parks for users and staff. This lighting will provide a deterrent for crime at these locations. The lack of proper lighting at these parks make the facilities within them less appealing for use by the general public. This project will continue the Recreation and Parks Department’s efforts to provide energy efficient, well maintained, and safe facilities in our communities. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community expects safety concerns to be addressed in a timely manner. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Milo-Grogan (48), Franklinton (54), Near East (56), Livingston Avenue Area (62)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by maximizing the use of existing recreational facilities for enhanced programming and offerings. Additionally, providing this lighting will create a safer environment for park users and staff. Using energy-efficient solar lamps for the site lighting will provide greater efficiency at these locations as well. \n \n \n \nFiscal Impact: $197,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract. The balance of $15,000.00 on ACPO008416, established by Ordinance No. 3142-2022 in support of  solar lighting installation at New Beginnings Park in the Milo-Grogan Neighborhood, from Neighborhood Initiative Subfund 100018 will be used for this contract. A total of $212,000.00 is available for this contract.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Jess Howard Electric Company for the Solar Lighting 2022 Phase 2 Project; to authorize the transfer of $197,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $212,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund and Neighborhood Initiative Subfund; and to declare an emergency.
