    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with General Maintenance and Engineering Company for the Barnett Roof Replacement Project. The contract amount is $164,900.00, with a contingency of $15,100.00, for a total of $180,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Barnett Community Center located at 1184 Barnett Road was originally constructed in 1964 and received substantial renovations in 1999.  In 2010, the facility received a new roof to the lower west portion of the building. Approximately 7,000 square feet was installed by Kalkreuth Roofing and warrantied by Garland Roofing, the manufacturer, for 30 years.  At the time of this installation, it was noted that the desired slope for positive drainage of the roof could not be achieved due to the location of existing HVAC louvers. As a result, frequent ponding on the roof has resulted in premature failure of the roof system and frequent leaks, presenting a safety hazard to the building occupants. Due to the near daily requirement for roof repairs, Garland Roofing has agreed to provide all roof materials for replacement of this roof free of charge to the city. The cost of this project represents the labor necessary for removal of the original roof, removal of the 2010 roof installed overtop, and installation of the new roof. The new roof will be installed with tapered insulation to meet slopes necessary for correct drainage and this section of roof will be warrantied for an additional 30 years.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, via RFQ023692 and in accordance with City Code Section 329, on December 19, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on January 10, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nGeneral Maintenance and Engineering Company (MAJ): $164,900.00\nJB Roofing (MAJ): $283,200.00\nK&W Roofing (MAJ): $247,000.00\nKalkreuth Roofing (MAJ): $283,550.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that General Maintenance and Engineering Company was the lowest and most responsive bidder.
