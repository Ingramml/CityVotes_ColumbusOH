    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase a professional services contract with Murphy Epson Inc for the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project, CIP 650004-100005, in an amount up to $499,758.75, to pay for continuation of services.\n \nThe services provided in the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project consist of: supporting the implementation of Blueprint Columbus in multiple project areas; educating and informing residents about Blueprint Columbus and the problem being addressed; providing adequate notification and keeping residents in project areas apprised of work being performed in their neighborhood; advising the City regarding residents’ concerns; and providing training or additional support for contractors and City field and other staff as needed.\n \nThe Community Area for this project is “99-Citywide” since the project spans more than one Community Area.\n \n1.1 Future Renewals/Modifications:  The original contract projected needing services through 2032.  Renewals are anticipated every few years to add funds to continue services.\n   \n1.2 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $499,758.75\n      Original Contract                                                                     $368,118.00 (ORD 3172-2021; PO308187)\n                     Renewal No. 1 (Current)                                                                     $499,758.75\n                     Future Renewals (Estimated amount)                        $2,650,241.25                                                               \n                     TOTAL ESTIMATED COST                                                                  $3,518,118.00\n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:  Substantial information and knowledge has been developed by the consultant through work performed during the first years of the contract.  If the work to be performed under this renewal was to be bid out separately, tasks already completed would be performed repetitively causing delays and incurring additional cost.  \n \n1.4 How the cost of renewal was determined:  Through negotiations between Murphy Epson Inc and the Department of Public Utilities.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nAdministration of the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project contract ensures community input is received and utilized to design the best solutions for unique neighborhood needs. Not only does this help Blueprint develop comprehensive solutions for our community, it also helps create an efficient process that reduces excessive costs resulting from engineering redesigns and timeframe extensions associated with addressing resident concerns through a less formal process.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nMurphy Epson Inc’s contract compliance number is CC-004934 and expires 01/26/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) are not required for this contract renewal as no Federal or State funds will be expended on the contract.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Murphy Epson Inc is classified as a WBE company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Murphy Epson plans to use one subconsultant that is ODI certified as a majority company.  Murphy Epson plans to perform $287,183.75 of the work on this contract, so 57.5% of the work will be performed by a WBE.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund is also needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested so as not to cause delays in consent order timelines for Blueprint projects.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase a professional services contract with Murphy Epson for the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project;
