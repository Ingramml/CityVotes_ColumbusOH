Jones, dba C2U Construction LLC, to provide residential emergency electrical services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair program;  to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Development Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.

    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Charles D. Jones, dba C2U Construction LLC, in an amount up to $100,000.00 to provide residential emergency electrical services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program.\n \nEmergency Electrical Repair is part of the Emergency Repair Program, operated by the Division of Housing.  The program was established to assist low and moderate income homeowners with electrical issues that constitute an emergency condition.  Emergency repairs under this legislation will address small and large scale capital home improvements that, if not corrected, may require the owner to vacate their home.  Most homeowners are at or below 50% AMI as defined by HUD with exceptions allowed up to 80% AMI. \n \nThe department advertised and notified 401 registered vendor of RFQ022527 on August 2, 2022, and 626 registered vendors were notified of RFQ023115 on October 11, 2022, through Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide emergency electrical services.  Both competitively bid processes did not receive bids from contractors.  The Department of Development then sent eight (8) targeted emails to contractors requesting firm/fixed pricing to be submitted by December 16, 2022 from vendors that responded through outreach events.  \n \nTwo (2) contractors replied with pricing, Charles D. Jones dba C2U Construction LLC (registered with the city, but not certified MWBE firm) and Word of Mouth Electric & Rehab LLC (registered with the city, but not certified MWBE firm).  Only Charles D. Jones dba C2U Construction LLC provided firm/fixed pricing.  C2U Construction LLC shall have one subcontractor, McGhee Electric LLC (not registered with the City).\n \nEmergency action is requested as it is immediately necessary to enter into contract with Charles D. Jones dba C2U Construction as there exists no current electrical contractor to provide services under the Emergency Mechanical Repair program, without which, residents of these households, who cannot afford the expense of services, may not be able to remain in their homes.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the Development Taxable Bond Fund. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 043528 and expires 1/9/2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Development Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a contract in an amount up to $100,000.00 with Charles D. Jones, dba C2U Construction LLC, to provide residential emergency electrical services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair program;  to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Development Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Emergency Repair Program was established to assist low and moderate income homeowners with emergency electrical services that would impact a household remaining safely in their home; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development has advertised Emergency Electric Repair Program two (2) times on Vendor Services and did not receive responses and then sent targeted emails requesting pricing from contractors to provide emergency electrical services; and \n \nWHEREAS, two contractors responded to the targeted emails and one was responsive: and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to enter into contract with Charles D. Jones dba C2U Construction as there exists no current electrical contractor to provide services under the Emergency Mechanical Repair program, without which, residents of these households, who cannot afford the expense of services, may not be able to remain in their homes, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to enter into contract, in an amount up to $100,000.00, with Charles D.
