    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $50,000.00 of the 2023 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement - Not for Profit Service Contract with Rebuilding Together Central Ohio, dba Modcon Living, in an amount up to $50,000.00 to administer the CHORES program.\n \nThe department advertised a request for proposal for the CHORES Program on Vendor Services (RFQ023699) and Bonfire from 1/10/2023-2/6/2023.  Two proposals were received and both were responsive.  The organizations are:  Epiphany Consulting LLC and Rebuilding Together Central Ohio dba Modcon Living.\n \nThe mission of the Department of Development’s Homeowner Services Center’s home repair program, of which CHORES is a part of, is: “assisting individuals and families to remain in their homes and live independently in a safe and sound environment.” The CHORES Program will provide the finances necessary to enable low and moderate-income senior and disabled homeowners to remain in their homes by providing basic home maintenance and minor repair services at no charge to the homeowner.  \n \nThese services are being contracted out as the department does not have the resources to manage this program internally.\n \nThe department anticipates modifying this agreement for the remainder of the city’s Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan with HUD.  Based upon mutual agreement, the department would submit legislation to modify the agreement to add additional funds for program year 2024.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the CDBG portion of the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan, per Ordinance 3353-2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested because there is an immediate need to service the many senior, disabled, low and moderate income homeowners, whose homes require basic home maintenance and minor repairs and provide for the timely expenditure of funds to satisfy HUD. \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 005045 and expires 12/6/2024.\n \nFiscal Impact: $50,000.00 is available from the 2023 CDBG grant.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $50,000.00 of 2023 Community Development Block grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement - Not for Profit Service Contract with Rebuilding Together Central Ohio, dba Modcon Living, in an amount up to $50,000.00, to administer the CHORES program; and to declare an emergency.
