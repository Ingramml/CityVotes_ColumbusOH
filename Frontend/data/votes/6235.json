    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  In 2021, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office launched the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention pilot program. Through this Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funded pilot, low-income residents have access to free vehicle safety light repairs. These free repair services keep drivers, passengers and pedestrians safer on the roads and help prevent low-income residents from receiving tickets for safety code violations. This pilot is a partnership between the Columbus City Attorney’s Office (CAO) and Columbus Division of Police. \n \nTo ensure consistent and ready access to quality repair services for program participants, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office worked through Columbus State's Automotive Advisory Board to identify accredited auto shops interested in serving as repair partners for the pilot. Interested parties were vetted to ensure their capacity to meet project terms and requirements as defined by the CAO, the grantor and included in the City of Columbus’ standard service contract. Through this process, CAO entered into contract with Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care and Lindsay Automotive Inc. for repair services. \n \nDue to the success of the program, the City Attorney will extend the pilot through calendar year 2023. This legislation requests contract extensions for the Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care and Lindsay Automotive Inc. repair service contracts through December 2023 (service contracts and POs are attached).\n \n                     §                     Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Contract Purchase Orders: PO299839, PO349838\n                     §                     Lindsay Automotive Inc.
