    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The purpose of this ordinance is to authorize a contract with Equitas Health, a not for profit service provider, to continue a partnership to support the community-wide comprehensive harm reduction program called Safe Point, in an amount not to exceed $350,000.00 for a period of January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023. \n \nHarm reduction services provided by Equitas Health allow clients who are at high-risk of accidental overdose death to access the lifesaving drug, Naloxone, and receive risk reduction counseling, referrals to Alcohol & Drug treatment, and overdose prevention education. In 2022, Safe Point provided services to 4,343 individual clients and had a total of 8,123 visits. Clients who participate in the Safe Point program are provided access to many types of care that address both their active substance use disorder, as well as other social determinants of health.  Throughout 2022, Safe Point has provided 207 referrals for Alcohol and Drug Treatment, 121 linkages to medical care, provided overdose prevention education to 3,302 clients, and 42 referrals for behavioral or mental healthcare services.\n \nOhio Revised Code (ORC) 3707.57 states that the Board of Health has to approve/establish a blood borne infectious disease prevention program.
