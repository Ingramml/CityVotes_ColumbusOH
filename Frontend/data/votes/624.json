    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with MY Project USA in support of a youth soccer program in the Wedgewood neighborhood. \n \nMY Project USA aims to protect and empower Columbus youth by providing access to educational, healthy, and fun programs that help to keep them safe and connect them with positive influences. The Wedgewood Village Apartment community is home to approximately 2,000 children who need increased access to programs, protection, and the tools that lead to empowerment.\n \nFamilies in the Wedgewood community have a great appreciation for and desire to play soccer. MY Project USA started a soccer team in Wedgewood in 2017, and due to the positive response, the organization developed a year-round program that engages hundreds of children on a weekly basis. With support from Columbus City Council, more youth will have access to the program, which, in addition to enriching their lives, has led to increased morale and safety in the neighborhood. \n \nLast year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, MY Project USA was able to engage 250 youths in the Greater Hilltop and the surrounding area and hope to engage 350-500 youths in 2021.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Reimagine Safety subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in supporting and expanding the MY Project USA Wedgewood soccer program to provide more opportunities for youth engagement.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with MY Project USA in support of the Wedgewood youth soccer program; to authorize an appropriation within the Reimagine Safety fund; to authorize a transfer between funds, to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Recreation and Parks Operation and Extension fund; and to declare an emergency.
