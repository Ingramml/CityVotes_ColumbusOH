    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish additional funding for a previous order to George Byers Sons, Inc. (PA004790) for the purchase of one (1) truck cab chassis to later be up-fit as a tire service truck, and three (3) mechanics trucks for use by the Fleet Management Division.  The purchase order for these vehicles will be issued from a Universal Term Contract (UTC) that has been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. Due to supply chain demands and long lead times there has been a discrepancy between the originally ordered cost of the trucks and price upon completion and delivery of the order. This increase needs paid to ensure completion of the order. The amount being requested is to provide for the difference from the originally legislated and approved amount by Ordinance 2107-2022.\n \nGeorge Byers Sons, Inc. vendor#006008, PA004790 & PA004948 - Light Duty Trucks & Police Vehicles - expires 6/30/23\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal Excluded Parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract as per the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance seeks authority to expend $19,965.00 from the Fleet Capital Fund for the purchase of one (1) truck cab chassis to later be up-fit as a tire service truck, and three (3) mechanics trucks. This ordinance is an addition to Ordinance 2107-2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicles to increase in cost as well as limit their availability. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet may ensure the pending purchase and delivery of these vehicles, which will not occur without this additional funding. \n \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to establish additional purchase orders for the price difference of one (1) truck cab chassis to later be up-fit as a tire service truck, and three (3) mechanics trucks; to authorize the expenditure of $19,965.00 from the Fleet Capital Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($19,965.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Departments have a need to replace older high mileage and high maintenance vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, the replacement of these vehicles will reduce maintenance, service, and fuel-related costs associated with ongoing ownership of older vehicles and is necessary as part of the City's ongoing investment in vehicle assets; and\n \nWHEREAS, George Byers Sons, Inc. successfully bid and was awarded contracts PA004790 - Light Duty Trucks, expires 6/30/23; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding for these vehicles is budgeted and available within Fleet Capital fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Finance & Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to establish this purchase order in order to secure delivery and prompt payment for the vehicles needed by various City departments, which will otherwise be delayed due to the instability of the automobile supply chain; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, is hereby authorized to establish an additional purchase order from previously established Universal Term Contracts for the acquisition of vehicles for use by several City Departments with the following vendor:\n \nGeorge Byers Sons, Inc.

That the monies in the foregoing Sections shall be paid upon order of the Director of Finance and Management, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4. Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 6.
