    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify a contract with The Research Foundation of the City University of New York on behalf of Criminologist David Kennedy and the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College. The City entered into contract with The Research Foundation on behalf of David Kennedy in 2020 via ordinance 2106-2020 which passed City Council on 10/12/2020. This original ordinance was to assist the City in taking steps towards the implementation of a comprehensive Group Violence Intervention (GVI) strategy in Columbus. GVI focuses on the groups at highest risk for violent victimization and offending, with the intention to keep those in them alive, safe, and out of prison.\nThe National Network’s operational approach includes working with cities to identify serious violent crime problems; assembling partnerships of law enforcement, community leaders, and social service providers; conducting crime analyses to identify the conditions driving the majority of serious offending; devising a response that uses enforcement strategically to reduce collateral consequences while increasing police legitimacy and public safety; focusing services and community resources on those at the highest risk for violence, victimization, or offending; and, where applicable, delivering prior notice of the consequences for further offending.\nThis modification will increase the original contract of $80,000.00 by $195,000 for a total contract, including the amendment, of $275,000.00. The need for additional funds was not known at the time of the original contract; however, Columbus City Council amended the 2021 City budget to include funds for this amendment.\nTerm: The agreement shall extend the contract term originally ending May 31, 2021 to May 31,2022.\nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation of $350,000.00 within the Reimagine Safety Fund, the transfer of these funds to Public Safety's General Fund, and the expenditure of $195,000.00 with the Research Foundation of the City University of New York to support a comprehensive problem analysis of serious violence in the City of Columbus.    \nEmergency action is requested so that a contract can be entered into immediately and project activities can continue without interruption.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate $350,000.00 within the Reimagine Safety Fund and to transfer such funds to Public Safety's General Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify a contract with The Research Foundation of the City University of New York on behalf of Criminologist David Kennedy and the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College to assist the City in serious violence prevention; to authorize the expenditure of $195,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($195,000.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City has a need to reduce violence and improve public safety, minimize arrest and incarceration, strengthen communities, and improve relationships between  law enforcement and the communities it serves; and, \nWHEREAS, the City has identified the National Network for Safe Communities, a project of John Jay College of Criminal Justice as a group that supports cities implementing proven strategic interventions to reduce violence; and,\nWHEREAS, Dr. David Kennedy and the National Network’s operational approach includes working with cities to identify serious violent crime problems; assembling partnerships of law enforcement, community leaders, and social service providers; conducting crime analyses to identify the conditions driving the majority of serious offending; and devising a response that uses enforcement strategically to reduce collateral consequences; and,                                                                                                                                                                                             \nWHEREAS, the original contract of $80,000.00 for this project needs modified for an additional $195,000.00 for a total of $275,000.00 and to extend the end date for the term of the agreement extended from May 31, 2021 to May 31, 2022; and,\nWHEREAS, the original contract Scope of Services was for an analysis of network mapping of groups involved with violence, with an emphasis on individuals committing the most violence within these groups; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the modified contract will provide intensive strategic advising  to assist the City to develop a violence intervention plan, intensive strategic advising concerning operational support, day-to-day advising, implementation reviews, and stakeholder engagement.  Likewise, based on their extensive resources and expertise, NNSC will also provide access to management and development tools, training modules, and workshops. Lastly, access to other GUI practitioners will be provided for peer exchanges and working sessions; and,\n \nWHEREAS, funds are budgeted in the Reimagine Public Safety Fund established by Columbus City Council for this project; and,                                                                                                                               \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds and to authorize the Director of Public Safety to modify a contract with The Research Foundation of the City University of New York on behalf of Criminologist David Kennedy and the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College to support a comprehensive analysis of serious violence in the City of Columbus, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to modify a contract with The Research Foundation of the City University of New York on behalf of Criminologist David Kennedy and the National Network for Safe Communities at John Jay College to support a comprehensive analysis of serious violence in the City of Columbus.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That the appropriation of $350,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within the unappropriated balance of the Reimagine Safety Fund 1000, subfund 100019 and the transfer of such funds to Public Safety's General Fund Budget per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 3.  That the appropriation of $350,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within the unappropriated balance of the General Fund of Public Safety Fund 1000, subfund 100010 per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 4.
