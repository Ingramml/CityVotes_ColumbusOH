    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to approve the re-purposing of previously legislated funds which were passed to establish purchase orders and additional funding for the acquisition of automobiles, light duty trucks and additional equipment for the Columbus Divisions of Parks & Rec, Code Enforcement, Facilities, Health, Refuse and Fleet Management. These purchase orders for the vehicle purchases will be issued from Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) that have been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. \n  \nPurchase orders will be established with George Byers Sons Inc, (PA004790 & PA004948) for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks. \n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, Vendor#006008, PA004790 & PA004948, expires 6/30/23 - ($32,096.00)\n \nThese vehicles are to be purchased as replacements for older, high mileage, and high maintenance vehicles currently in service and as such will reduce maintenance expenses, fuel consumption, and general upkeep costs.  \n \nPreviously, Ordinance 2667-2021 authorized $951,321.00 for the purchase of automobiles and light duty trucks for the Division of Fleet Management. Due to complications and unforeseen supply line issues these orders were not completely fulfilled. There were price increases on some of the required equipment as well as a model year change on two of the pending vehicles. With the combination of these previously established funds $32,096.00 in additional funding is needed so that these orders can be fulfilled and the 2021 Buy Plan completed. \n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the combined expenditure of $983,417.00 with George Byers Sons for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks for use by the Columbus Divisions of Parks & Rec, Code Enforcement, Facilities, Health, Refuse and Fleet Management. $951,321.00 is available on previously established ACPR002073 which was legislated for use by Ord. 2667-2021 combined with an additional $32,096.00 which will be expended from the 2023 Purchase Plan (Ord. 0213-2023) for a total expenditure of $983,417.00. $7,200,000.00 was budgeted for the 2021 Citywide Vehicle Acquisitions.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to market volatility of automobile manufactures and increased shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. It would be advantageous for the City to process these purchase orders as soon as possible in order to offset potential delays due to supply chain pressures. \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to establish a purchase order from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles for use by the Divisions of Parks & Rec, Code Enforcement, Facilities, Health, Refuse and Fleet Management, with George Byers Sons Inc and Ricart Properties Inc; to authorize the expenditure of an additional $32,096.00 expended from the appropriated 2023 Purchase Plan funds (Ord. 0213-2023) in combination with the previously legislated $951,321.00 for a total expenditure of $983,417.00 to George Byers Sons; and to declare an emergency. ($983,417.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the global supply chain disruption requires the City to change the model year of the previously legislated purchases and account for upgrades to the units at prices higher than the original contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Divisions of Parks & Rec, Code Enforcement, Facilities, Health, Refuse and Fleet Management has a need to replace older high mileage and high maintenance vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, the replacement of these vehicles will reduce maintenance, service, and fuel-related costs associated with ongoing ownership of older vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, George Byers Sons Inc successfully bid and was awarded contracts PA004790 (expires 6/30/23) and PA004948 (expires 6/30/23); and\n \nWHEREAS, funding for these vehicles is budgeted and available within the 2023 Fleet Vehicle Purchase Plan (Ord. 0213-2023/ACPR002432); and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Finance & Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to establish various purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of these new vehicles for use by various City Departments at the earliest possible time due to market volatility of automobile manufactures and increased shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles and offset potential delays due to supply chain pressures; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Divisions of Parks & Rec, Code Enforcement, Facilities, Health, Refuse and Fleet Management, is hereby authorized to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts for the acquisition of vehicles for use by the Divisions of Parks & Rec, Code Enforcement, Facilities, Health, Refuse and Fleet Management with the following vendor:\n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, PA004790 & PA004948 ($983,417.00) - vehicles\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $951,321.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, in regard to the actions authorized in Sections 1 and is hereby authorized and approved from ACPR002073.\n \nSECTION 3. That the expenditure of $32,096.00.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, in regard to the actions authorized in Sections 1 and is hereby authorized and approved from ACPR002432\n \nSECTION 4. That the monies in the foregoing Sections shall be paid upon order of the Director of Finance and Management, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 6. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as is necessary.\n \nSECTION 7. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
