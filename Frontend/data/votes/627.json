    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police to enter into contract with RQI, a subsidiary of the American Heart Association, for CPR and First Aid Training. On February 1, 2021, Columbus City Council passed Columbus City Code 1915.01 - Rendering aid following use of force. This new law requires, among other things, that the Division of Police train officers on CPR and first aid in the academy and retrain those topics at least biennially.  The law also requires all Division personnel to be trained in CPR and first aid within 6 months of the law’s passage, which creates a deadline of September 3, 2021.  In order to provide this continuing education training, City Council amended the city budget to include the funding for this initiative.  The City already has a contract with RQI with the Division of Fire for the same training.  RQI provides mannequin stations and computer software which will allow personnel to complete bi-annual training, without assistance, in less than ten minutes in most cases.  This legislation also authorizes an appropriation for the services and supplies necessary for this initiative.\nBid Information: The formal bid process was waived per City Code Section 329 due to a new law that requires immediate compliance and there is insufficient time to accomplish formal competitive bidding and satisfy the needs in order to comply with the requirements of this new law.\nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation of $112,891.00 within the Reimagine Safety Fund, the transfer of these funds to Division of Police’s General Fund, and the expenditure of $53,000.00 with RQI to train Division Personnel in CPR.    \nEmergency action is requested so that a contract can be entered into immediately and personnel can be trained by the deadline set by the new City Code. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate $112,891.00 within the Reimagine Safety Fund and to transfer such funds and appropriation to the Division of Police’s General Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into contract with RQI for CPR and first aid training; to authorize the expenditure of $53,000.00 from the General Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency ($112,891.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Police is in need of CPR and first aid training to adhere to new Columbus City Code 1915.01 passed on February 1, 2021 which states that all Division Personnel need to be trained in CPR and first aid within 6 months of the law’s passage; and, \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive competitive bidding and enter into contract with RQI, who is the vendor used by the Division of Fire for CPR training, services, and equipment, to meet the required deadline of September 3, 2021; and,\nWHEREAS, funds are budgeted in the Reimagine Public Safety Fund established by Columbus City Council for this training; and,                                                                                                                               \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds and to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into contract with RQI for CPR and first aid training, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n:SECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to enter into contract with RQI for CPR and first aid training to adhere to the new City Code 1915.01 that went into effect on February 1, 2021 and stipulates a six month time frame for compliance. \nSECTION 2.  That the appropriation of $112,891.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within the unappropriated balance of the Reimagine Safety Fund 1000, subfund 100019 as well as the transfer of said funds to the Division of Police's General Fund Budget per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 3.  That the appropriation of $112,891.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within the unappropriated balance of the General Fund 1000, subfund 100010 per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 4.  That the expenditure of up to $53,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is hereby authorized in the General Fund 1000, in Object Class 03 - Contractual Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this Council finds it in the best interest to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes in order to execute this contract.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 7.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing sections shall be paid upon the order of the Director of the Department of Public Safety, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 8.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 9.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
