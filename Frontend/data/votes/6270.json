The bathhouse at Marion Franklin, which was built in 2016, will undergo renovation and the bath house at Tuttle will be replaced along with the pedestrian bridge that connects the parking lot to the pool. Both pools will be more inclusive to persons with various abilities and meet the requirements obtained by the public outreach activities which are part of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan.  \n \nBoth pools, in their current configuration, are limiting as far as programming is concerned based on their amenities. It is the intent of the design to increase the capacity for programs and to increase attendance. Design is anticipated to begin in April 2023. We anticipate delivering this project with a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) procurement process.  Purchasing of Pools materials will begin in early 2024 and construction activities will start at each location in 2024 at the conclusion of the aquatics season. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on November 9, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on December 8, 2022  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nOrchard, Hiltz and McCliment (MAJ)\nMeyers and Associates (MAJ)\nMSA Design (MAJ)\nDynotec, Inc.
