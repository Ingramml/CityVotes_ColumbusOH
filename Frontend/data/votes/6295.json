    "description": "Title\nTo Designate April 11-April 17 as Black Maternal Health Week in the City of Columbus and recognize Restoring Our Own through Transformation  for their ongoing efforts to raise awareness for Black maternal and infant health.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the U.S. has among the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world with 26.4 deaths per live birth, and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that nearly 60% of pregnancy related deaths are preventable; and,\n \nWHEREAS, there exists an extreme disparity in maternal health between Black women and their peers as they are three to four times more likely to die from birth-related complications; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this phenomenon is a result of a multiplicity of root causes, including gaps in healthcare coverage, social determinants of health, economic disparities, and racism; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Black women are disproportionately more likely to suffer from Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders, such as postpartum depression, in isolation and without access to the necessary healthcare resources to address it; and,\n \nWHEREAS, gaps in access to basic reproductive healthcare, like STI screenings, abortion and contraception access, and counseling, leaves Black women at higher risks for health implications from pregnancy; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Black-led doula and midwifery care is a sound, evidence-based form of healthcare for Black women and birthing people, providing life-saving services and reducing mortality rates among these vulnerable populations; and,\n \nWHEREAS, to adequately address racial inequities within the City of Columbus, these maternal health disparities must be acknowledged and addressed, providing more affordable and accessible healthcare resources to Black women; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Black Maternal Health Week is celebrated annually to uplift the voices of Black women and birthing people through advocacy efforts seeking to ensure they retain their fundamental right to bodily autonomy and safety; and, \n \nWHEREAS,  Restoring Our Own through Transformation  (ROOTT) is dedicated to raise awareness for Black maternal and infant health through doula services and training, research, education. and consultation; now therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED THAT THIS COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: Declares April 11-17, 2023 as Black Maternal Health Week within Columbus and encourages the appropriate educational and advocacy activities.",
