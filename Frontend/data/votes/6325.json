Green Columbus is increasing efforts to plant trees in Central Ohio. Additional benefits include reduced stormwater runoff and increased biodiversity.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide Green Columbus with the resources necessary to sustain ongoing programming and event planning, specifically for upcoming Earth Day which is April 22, 2023.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding for this grant is available within the Recreation and Parks operating fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with Green Columbus to maintain programs dedicated to environmental stewardship and the revitalization of the city’s tree canopy; to authorize a transfer and expenditure within the Recreation and Parks operating fund; and to declare an emergency.
