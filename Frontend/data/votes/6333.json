    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify (Modification No. 1) a contract with M Power Inc. in an amount up to $1,530.00.  \n \nOriginal contract amount                     $ 20,000.00                     Ord.

The bids allowed the establishment of one year contracts.  \n \nThe Department of Building and Zoning Services advertised RFQ020584 on Vendor Services in December 2021 for the weed and solid waste abatement program and 17 bids were received.  The Director of Building and Zoning Services entered into contract with 12 bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  The contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to April 30, 2023.\n \nDue to an internal clerical error, the department’s program manager assigned work to M Power Inc. in excess of available contract funding. M Power Inc. completed the assigned work order. The department incurred these additional costs according to the agreed-upon price schedule of the original contract.\n \nModifying the agreement to add funds will allow the Department of Building and Zoning Service to compensate M Power Inc. for services already rendered.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify a contract with M Power Inc. in an amount up to $1,530.00; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,530.00 from the General Fund.
