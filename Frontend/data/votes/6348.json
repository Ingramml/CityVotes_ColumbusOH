    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into a contract with MCM Technology LLC., to upgrade the existing CommSHOP 360 Solution software application that is used to help manage the City's 800 MHz radios and associated equipment.  The City of Columbus had purchased this software several years ago.  The Division of Support Services now has a need to upgrade the software in order to continue to manage the radio assets.  The software upgrade from MCM Technology will allow for the ease of use and data migration to the new technology platform. MCM Technology will provide maintenance support for the life of the software upgrade.     \n \nBid Information:  This software was bid originally in 2006 and there were four bidders.  MCM Technology, LLC was the lowest and most responsive bidder.  The annual maintenance since then has been processed and paid for by the Department of Technology.  This ordinance is requesting that this upgrade be awarded via the Sole Source provisions of the City Code Chapter 329 as MCM Technology is the sole distributor of current software.  CommSHOP 360 is the only software that incorporates all the necessary elements that the Division of Support Services needs to properly track and manage the City's radio assets, control the radio ID's, manage the radio assets of other agencies, and provide the billing of radio services to other agencies.\n \nContract Compliance:  \nMCM Technology LLC - Vendor#000391- Contract Compliance Number # CC-000391\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This ordinance is considered to be an emergency measure to allow for the immediate funding to upgrade the software.  The emergency is also needed to assure that the current cost of the product does not increase as the developer has a price increase coming to this platform in April and to assure continued functionality of the product.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $77,940.00 with MCM Technology, LLC to upgrade existing CommSHOP 360 Solution software application that manages the City's radio system assets. Funds for this purchase are budgeted within the Division of Support Services general fund budget.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Support Services, to enter into a contract with MCM Technology LLC., to upgrade the existing software application used to manage and keep track of the City's radio systems; in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Columbus City Codes; to authorize an expenditure of $77,940.00 from the Division of Support Services general fund budget; and to declare an emergency. ($77,940.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Support Services manages the existing CommSHOP 360 Solution software application; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Support Services Division has a need to upgrade to the latest software to support this important communications infrastructure, and,\n \nWHEREAS, the existing system is proprietary to MCM Technology LLC.; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the City’s best interest to authorize the sole source provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 to enter into contract with MCM Technology LLC., to upgrade the proprietary software as they are the only vendor that provides this software, and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Support Services, in that it is immediately necessary to upgrade the existing CommSHOP 360 Solution software application to help manage the City's radio infrastructure and allow for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Safety be and is hereby authorized to enter into contract with MCM Technology LLC., to upgrade the existing CommSHOP 360 Solution software application for the Division of Support Services. \n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $77,940.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this agreement is hereby entered into pursuant to the sole source provisions of Chapter 329 of the City Code for the upgrade of the software application. \n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary \n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared and emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same",
