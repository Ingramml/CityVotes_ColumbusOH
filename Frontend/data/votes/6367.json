    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Danbert, Inc., for the Greenway Avenue Area Water Line Improvements project, CIP #690236-100100, in an amount up to $4,534,285.44, and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction administration and inspection services in an amount up to $578,664.00, for a total expenditure of $5,112,949.44.  It also increases the amount of loan funding that may be sought to finance this project.\n \nThe work consists of rehabilitating approximately 10,300 linear feet of 2-inch copper, 6-inch, 8-inch and 12-inch water mains.  The work will be primary performed along Greenway Avenue, Parkwood Avenue, Burt Street, Eastwood Avenue, Woodland Avenue, Rose Avenue, Gibbard Avenue, East Fifth Avenue, North Broadleigh Road, Maryland Avenue, Denver Avenue, McAllister Avenue, East Cherry Street, and English Way.\n \nOrdinance 1107-2022, passed 05/04/22, authorized the Department of Public Utilities to seek loan funding through the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) Loan Agreements, jointly administered by the Ohio EPA’s Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance (DEFA) and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA), for this project and several other projects.  That legislation estimated the loan amount to cover the construction cost of the  Greenway Avenue Area Water Line Improvements project would be $4,200,000.00.  The actual construction cost for this project per the bids received for this project is higher than the $4,200,000.00 loan amount ORD 1107-2022 authorized for this project.  This ordinance seeks City Council approval to increase the loan amount that can be sought for this project to cover the entire cost of construction and any additional administration costs that may be associated with seeking and administering the loan.   \n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 99 - Citywide as work will be performed in 48 - Milo-Grogan, 49 - North Central, 50 - East Columbus, 57 - Mid East, and 56 - Near East.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe goal of this project is to replace or rehabilitate the existing water lines that have a high break frequency.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss.  The Neighborhood Liaison(s) has been contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Greenway Avenue Area Water Line Improvements project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 01/04/23 through 02/01/23.  Four bids were received for the project and were opened on 02/01/23.  The following companies submitted bids:\n  \nCompany                                                                  Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\nDanbert, Inc.                                                                 $4,534,285.44                                          CC-004618                                          MAJ\nFields Excavating                                            $4,619,463.31                                          CC-005416                                          MAJ\nElite Excavating                                                                   $5,220,344.80                                          CC-001064                                          MAJ\nJohn Eramo & Sons                                            $6,064,603.83                                          CC-004251                                          MAJ\n \nThe Danbert bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $4,534,285.44.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nDanbert’s contract compliance number is CC-004618 and expires 02/09/24.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Danbert. \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nDanbert and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nA transfer of funds from the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund, Fund 6011, in the amount of $4,534,285.44 is needed to fund construction for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the Ohio EPA to reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in March, 2023.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget will be needed to reflect more money is being borrowed for the project ($4,534,285.44) than is currently shown in the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget ($3,000,000.00).  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.  \nFunds in the amount of $578,664.00 for construction administration and inspection are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget;
