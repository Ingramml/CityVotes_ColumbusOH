    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with numerous not-for-profit, social service agencies for the provision of human services programming for a 12 month period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, in an amount up to $4,420,000.00, for the Elevate 2.0! Program.\n \nThe Elevate 2.0! Program is a rebranding of the Department’s Human Services Grant program due to COVID-19.  Prior year investment strategies included:  Income through Employment, Job Quality, Education and Training, Financial Capability, and Stabilization and Resource Support.  COVID-19 significantly impacted not-for-profit organizations and the residents of Columbus.  There was an increase in homelessness, housing instability, lost jobs, increase in violence, and increase in health issues.  Not-for-profit agencies were challenged to address these needs as donations dropped off.  To address these issues, the Department of Development will focus on supporting not-for-profit organizations providing human services programming in the following areas:  Infant Vitality, Homelessness, Housing Stability, Finance Security, Workforce Development, Violence Elimination, Re-entry, Neighborhood Building, and Chronic Disease Prevention. All of the focus areas are tied to Mayor Ginther’s Equity Agenda/Opportunity Rising.\n \nThe Elevate! 2.0 NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability) was made available to local not-for-profit organizations from September 12, 2022, to October 3, 2022. The Department received 142 applications with requests for funding totaling $14,050,000.00.  Proposals were reviewed by a 24 member team. Sixty-six programs were selected for funding in 2023.  \n \nThe awards are given with an anticipated renewal in FY2024 and FY 2025, pending availability of funds and program performance per agreements with each agency.  See Exhibit A, attached to this ordinance, for a list of organizations to be awarded under this piece of legislation.\n \nThis ordinance includes authorization for nine program areas with 60 agencies, with authorization for others agreements being submitted as separate pieces of legislation.  Each will be a “grant agreement” with the agency because funding will be advanced to the agency on a predetermined schedule.  Advancement of funds is needed because many of the organizations do not have funding available to be reimbursed for program expenses.   The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order.  Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the grant agreement.  This will continue throughout the term of the grant agreement.  Additionally, some programs/grant agreements may include food for participants of the programs (e.g. Mid-Ohio Foodbank).\n \nEmergency action is requested to reimburse for approved expenses incurred since January 1, 2023, to prevent each organization from experiencing a financial hardship.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these expenditures is allocated from the Emergency Human Services Fund 2023 budget (Fund 2231), up to $2,639,000.00, and the Administration Division’s 2023 General Fund budget, up to $1,781,000.00 (Fund 1000).  Funds were budgeted in object class 03, but will be transferred to object class 05.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: See attached Exhibit A for a list of social services agencies and the vendor registration and contract compliance data.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with numerous not-for-profit, social service agencies in an amount up to $4,420,000.00 for the Elevate 2.0! Program; to authorize the provision of services for a 12 month period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023; to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of programs included in the grant agreements; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; to authorize the expenditure of up to $2,639,000.00 from the Hotel Motel Tax Fund and up to $1,781,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
