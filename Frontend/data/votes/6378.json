    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Franklin County Commissioners in order to reimburse Franklin County for the City's portion of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) costs arising out of the lawsuit known as State ex rel,. Altman-Bates v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd. 2016-Ohio-3100 that mandates service credit for up to 254 current and former employees of the non-profit Franklin County Public Defender’s office (FCPD) hired between 1985 and 1992.    The Ohio Supreme Court's decision in Altman-Bates is based upon a previous court case also involving pension obligations known as State ex rel. Mallory v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Bd. (1998), 82 Ohio St. 3d 235, 1998-Ohio-380. The City of Columbus and Franklin County previously negotiated an agreement to settle the financial obligations of the Mallory case which was authorized by City Council through ordinance 0782-1999. This agreement stated that the two entities would share expenses associated with the Mallory case. \n \nThe (FCPD) office was organized as a non-profit corporation prior to 1999. The Public Employees Retirement Board (PERB) had initially determined that employees of the non-profit Franklin County Public Defender’s Office were not entitled to service credit in OPERS.  However, in the Mallory case, the Ohio Supreme Court ordered OPERS to credit service time to the FCPD employees and further directed Franklin County to remit pension contributions to OPERS on behalf of the employees who worked for the former (FCPD) office hired between 1985 and 1992.\n \nFrom 1976 through the present, the City of Columbus has contracted with the Franklin County Commissioners and the FCPD office for the performance of the City’s duty under Chapter 173 of the Columbus City Codes, 1959, and Section 120 of the Ohio Revised Code to provide legal counsel to indigent persons charged with municipal criminal offenses. Therefore, the City of Columbus and the Franklin County Commissioners have previously shared the financial responsibility for these pension claims owed to OPERS relating to the initial claim in Mallory and have agreed to a financial settlement of pension obligations arising from the second Ohio Supreme Court case, Altman-Bates for the pension liability attributable to services performed by employees of the municipal unit of the FCPD office.   \n \nDating back to 1999, the City’s obligation under the Mallory case was approximately $3.7 million. A subsequent ordinance for continued claims was processed in 2017 via Ord 2665-2017, which authorized an additional $3.0 million. This ordinance seeks authority for $1.0 million to fund continued claims for approximately 200 employees. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes $1 million to settle potential claims to be paid to Franklin County based upon the decision in Altman-Bates. Funds for these claims are budgeted in the General Fund for this purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: Emergency legislation is required to facilitate prompt reimbursement to Franklin County.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Franklin County Commissioners in order to reimburse Franklin County for the City's portion of Ohio Public Employment Retirement Systems (OPERS) liability costs associated with the case of State ex re,. Altman-Bates v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd; 2016-Ohio-3100, to authorize the transfer of $1,000,000.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($1,000,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, from 1976 through the present, the City has contracted with the County and the Franklin County Public Defender (FCPD) for the performance of the City’s duty under Chapter 173 of  the City of Columbus Codes, and Chapter 120 of the Ohio Revised Code to provide legal counsel to indigent persons charged with municipal criminal offenses, and \n \nWHEREAS, the FCPD’s municipal unit has provided the contracted services, and \n \nWHEREAS, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled, in State ex rel.
