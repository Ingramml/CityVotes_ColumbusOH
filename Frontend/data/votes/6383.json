    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Your Life Has Possibilities, a non-profit entity, for the support of the Stop the Summer Slide Summer Camp.\n \nStop the Summer Slide Summer Camp is an academic camp that focuses on the Common Core Reading standards for grades K-5; which helps students to continue their learning over the summer. By implementing this summer camp in 2022, Your Life Has Possibilities was able to prevent their students from losing 39% of what they learned during the academic school year over the summer. The effects of summer learning differences are a primary cause of widening achievement gaps between students of lower and higher socioeconomic levels. The camp will help the students beat the odds, by gaining cumulative summer learning gains. The students will learn various reading strategies through the following curriculum: Leveled Literacy Intervention, supplemented with Scholastics reading bags for non-fiction, and technology-based reading using Raz Kids. Students attended the following field trips: Columbus Zoo, Slate Run Farm, COSI, Columbus Art Museum, and Innis Woods Parks. Camp participants receive support from the following: Girl Scouts, St. Vincent’s Social Skills training, Columbus Public Health Y.E.S. Program, Taekwondo, art class, and computer class. \n \nThe Stop the Summer Slide Summer Camp has the following goals for all camp participants:\n- Students in grades K-3 were exposed to academic learning through instruction in the areas of reading, math, science, and social studies; literacy is in all content areas of learning.\n- Students in grades 1-5 experienced extended learning opportunities through field trips.\n- Students in grades 1-5 explore math and science through cross-curricular lessons.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Your Life Has Possibilities for the support of the Stop the Summer Slide Summer Camp; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
