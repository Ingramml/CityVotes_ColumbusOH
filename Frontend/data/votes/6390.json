    "description": "Title\nTo honor and celebrate Mr. Damian Earley, a student at Whetstone High School in Columbus, Ohio, for receiving a U.S Patent for his “The Garbage Lot” invention.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Mr. Damian Earley, an 11th grader at Whetstone High School, deserves recognition for his outstanding commitment to innovation, sustainability, excellence, and community responsibility; and \n \nWHEREAS, Mr. Earley gained interest in the invention process early, participating in “Invention Convention” every year since the second grade. This is a competition where students go through the invention process to solve an everyday problem; and\n \nWHEREAS, after numerous awards and competitions won, in January 2023 Mr. Earley received a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for his invention titled “The Garbage Lot;” and\n \nWHEREAS, Mr. Earley’s invention is a weighted base that supports a trash or recycling bin.
