    "description": "Title\nTo Celebrate Donatos Pizza in Recognition of its 60th Anniversary\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Jim Grote began making pizza in Columbus at the age of 13 and took that passion to Ohio State, where he purchased what would become the first Donatos pizza at 1000 Thurman Avenue in 1963 during his sophomore year; and\nWHEREAS, Donatos quickly became beloved in Columbus and beyond and currently has 375 locations in 22 states, along 200 more non-traditional sales locations, such as sports stadiums; and \n \nWHEREAS, Donatos is an icon of the Columbus food scene and is listed on the Columbus Pizza Trail for its distinctly Columbus-style thin crust, square-cut pizza with edge-to-edge toppings; and\n \nWHEREAS, Donatos is built on a three part mission: make the best pizza, hire great people, and promote goodwill in the community; and \n \nWHEREAS, Donatos lives this mission by actively supporting community based initiatives to tackle hunger, housing, and health related issues through the Donatos Family Foundation and other charitable ventures, investing in improving the franchisee and employee experience, contributing to local economic development, and serving delicious pizza; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is proud that Donatos was founded here, commits to sourcing and preparing many of its ingredients in Ohio, and still calls Central Ohio home; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council celebrates Donatos Pizza in recognition of its 60th Anniversary",
