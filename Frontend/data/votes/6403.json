    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to transfer the responsibility of the CoGo Bike Share contract to the Director of the Department of Public Service. This ordinance also authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify and amend the existing contract for the CoGo Bike Share system with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC and to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU’s) with other municipalities in order to accept funds from those entities to contribute to the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System. This transfer of responsibility will be effective April 1, 2023. \n \nSince 2019, Motivate International, Inc., a division of Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC, has managed the CoGo Bike Share system. Motivate recently merged with and into its existing parent company, Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. Ordinance 2311-2021 authorized the City to modify the existing Bike Share Agreement with Lyft Bike Share and Scooters, LLC to assist in the acquisition, installation, and management of a bike sharing service for the City. Furthermore, Ordinance 2311-2021 authorized the amended Agreement to be directly between the City of Columbus and Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. This ordinance will authorize the Department of Public Service taking over responsibility for this amended Agreement for the City of Columbus. \n \nCurrently, the CoGo system has over 600 bikes and 88 stations throughout the city, averaging over 50,000 rides per year. The CoGo Bike Share system is popular with system members, tourists, residents, special event attendees, downtown employees, and students as it offers an alternative transit option in Columbus. The bike share system offers a unique low cost way to complete short trips without the use of a car. The health benefits of active transportation are well recognized as well. The system has also expanded into neighborhoods where access to a bike can offer an important transportation option. \n \nIt has been determined that it is necessary to assist in the funding of the operation and management of the bike sharing program. This ordinance will authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to continue making monthly payments to support the CoGo Bike Share System in accordance with the existing contract with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC. This will allow the system to remain in place while the department seeks to secure a long-term sponsor to fund the system.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so there is no interruption in the daily operation of the bike share system and to allow the transfer of responsibility to the Department of Public Service. In addition, emergency action is necessary to allow for immediate execution of the MOUs to accept funds from entities who commit to contribute to the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nFiscal Impact: The Amended Agreement will require a payment of $65.00 per bike dock per month and this ordinance authorizes the Department of Public Service to make monthly payments to Lyft of $65.00 per bike dock. This ordinance will provide $510,000.00 in funding to make these payments for multiple months while funding agreements are pursued and finalized. $510,000.00 is budgeted and available from within fund 6500 the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund to meet the financial obligations of these payments. The City Auditor established the CoGo Bike Share Property Management Fund 2294, Subfund 229405, as authorized by Ordinance No.: 2037-2013. Any future deposits that the City may receive, that are intended to support the bike share system, are hereby deemed to be appropriated to this subfund. It has become necessary to transfer these fund and any future deposits to the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund 6500.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds between the Property Management Fund and the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate funds within the Property Management Fund and the Mobility Enterprise Fund; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to transfer the responsibility of the CoGo Bike Share contract with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC to the Director of the Department of Public Service; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify and amend the existing contract for the CoGo Bike Share system with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC; to authorize the Director the Department of Public Service to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU’s) with other municipalities in order to accept funds from those entities to contribute to the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System; to authorize the Director the Department of Public Service to continue payments for the operation of the CoGo Bike Share System in accordance with the existing contract with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC as authorized by Ordinance 2311-2021; to authorize the expenditure of $510,000.00 from the Mobility Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
