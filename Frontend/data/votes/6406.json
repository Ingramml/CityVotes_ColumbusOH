Background:\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Paul & Jeanne Ross, owners of G & F QOZB LLC, asking that the City sell them a 0.031 acre portion of the unimproved alley that runs east/west directionally for 130+/- feet.  The width of the requested portion is 10+/- feet.  It is adjacent at the north to the parcel at 325 Taylor Avenue (PID 010-022018). \n \nSale of this excess right-of-way is to incorporate the right-of-way with the adjacent parcel for a new build duplex on the lot.  The additional property would be used to increase the building mass of the project, as well as provide more space for parking at the rear of the property.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to sell the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $10,800.00 was established.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on February 16, 2023.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to G & F QOZB LLC at the cost of $10,800.00 to them.\n \n2.
