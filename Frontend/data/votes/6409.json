    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with California Skateparks for the Dodge Skatepark Renovation Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $150,000.00.\n \nThe iconic Dodge Park Skatepark was designed by Frank Hawk, father to famous skateboarder Tony Hawk, and constructed in 1990. Dodge Park became the first public skatepark in a city where skateboarding was outlawed in most public places. At the time, it was the only skatepark in Central Columbus and the only skatepark within the Interstate 270 Loop. Dodge Skatepark is a historical space still heavily used by residents and popular for skateboarders around the country. As a well-used amenity, Dodge Skatepark needs an immediate restoration because the infrastructure is falling apart. Additionally, a master plan is needed to determine replacement costs, other enhancements, and an expansion area so it can continue to serve the public for the next 30 years.\n \nThe goals of this project will be to revive Dodge Skatepark through necessary concrete repair and replacement, addressing urgent safety issues. The project will also honor the historical relevance of the skatepark by maintaining the overall feel of the park while making intentional enhancements to better improve circulation and rideability. It will also provide means for the skatepark community to tell their story with their experience with the park, letting that story inform proposed improvements to the skatepark. Finally, it will master plan a future expansion for Dodge Skatepark that is constructible and does not conflict with any existing or proposed utilities. All services for this project are expected to be complete by November 2023. The future Dodge skatepark replacement and expansion is currently being planned for 2028.  \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 13, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 3, 2023. Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nCalifornia Skateparks (MAJ)\nGrindline Skateparks (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended California Skateparks be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCalifornia Skateparks\n273 North Benson Avenue \nUpland, California 91786                                                      \nWilliam Minadeo III, (909) 949-1601, info@californiaskateparks.com          \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 020189, 27-0118247\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 2, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to immediately address the significant safety issues at Dodge Skatepark involving cracked and failing hard surfaces.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The skatepark’s concrete has degraded to a point where it is not repairable without significant reconstruction. The asphalt is almost unrideable as the joints between the asphalt and concrete pose serious safety hazards. The extensive concrete cracking has opened up areas where weeds have started to sprout. For these reasons, the project scope includes resurfacing the existing skatepark, adding metal coping, and replacing the asphalt surface with new flush concrete. By following this plan, the skatepark will be better for riding and more durable. Furthermore, this approach will result in a higher quality park and make the user experience more enjoyable than ever before. According to the skating community, Dodge Skatepark is notoriously difficult to ride because of its one-directional flow and rough asphalt decks. However, by implementing the aforementioned improvements, the Dodge Skatepark can become a high-quality and better flowing park that can compete with any modern-day skatepark.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has submitted multiple requests to repair the Dodge Skatepark through direct email, phone calls, and 311 submissions. Tony Hawk, the legendary professional skateboarder, also visited the park in 2022 and, after his visit, posted on Twitter about the skatepark, requesting that that the Department repair the skatepark. \nThis project includes a deliberate and engaged approach with the community and the park users. The skating community and their collective input will determine which characteristics of Dodge Skatepark are preserved and which are improved.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Franklinton (54), Downtown (55)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving the design and safety at this park. \n \nFiscal Impact: $150,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with California Skateparks for the Dodge Skatepark Renovation Project; to authorize the transfer of $150,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
