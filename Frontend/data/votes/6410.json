This project represents a continued investment into the upkeep of parks as well as a continued commitment to empower our residents to participate in the creation of the parks. The design of this project was performed in-house during 2022 in order to commit additional funds towards construction, thereby accommodating more sites. This project will install 33 ADA Accessible furnishings at many sites that have not had any ADA Accessible furnishings previously. This project will remove 10 deteriorating benches and install six new benches at Twin Lakes Nature Preserve. This project will install 18 furnishings per Livingston Avenue Area (LAVA-C) community requests for Driving Park Circle, Old Oaks Park, and Roosevelt Park through the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) Program administered by the Department of Development.
