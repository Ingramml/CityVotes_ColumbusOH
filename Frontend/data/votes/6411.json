    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Tyevco for the Champions Driving Range Improvements Project. The contract amount is $23,585.00, with a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $33,585.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nColumbus Recreation and Parks operates Champions Golf Course and this course includes a driving range and practice area. This project will provide a concrete pad for artificial practice tees on the driving range. Adding this amenity will provide an opportunity to use the driving range during times it would otherwise be closed. As an example, after prolonged rain, the driving range would often be closed. Also, the grass tees close early in the fall to start recovery for the following season and do not reopen until the spring after the growing season has begun. Weather dictates the use of the driving range and, when it is closed, there is lost revenue and programming opportunities. The artificial tee area is an opportunity for the department to grow youth programming efforts at Champions and allow for the practice tees to be used for more of the year than they are currently. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on February 17, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 2, 2023.
