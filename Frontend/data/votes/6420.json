    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to apply for loans directly through the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) to finance Department of Public Utilities capital improvement projects, to accept the loan funding if offered under terms agreeable to the City of Columbus, and to execute the documents needed to accept the loans.  This ordinance also requests that new Fund Numbers be established by the Auditor’s Office and the Director of the Department of Finance and Management for the financial tracking of these loans.\n \nThe OWDA’s mission is to provide financial assistance for environmental infrastructure from the sale of municipal revenue bonds through loans to local governments in Ohio.  These loans are available at interest rates below what the City can obtain through a bond sale.  Not all Department of Public Utilities projects meet the OWDA requirements to be eligible for loans.  The Department of Public Utilities has been in discussions with OWDA concerning projects expected to need funding through 3/31/24 and determined the following projects appear to qualify to be funded through the OWDA Direct loan program:\n \n\n\n\nProject Number\n\nProject Name\n\nProject Phase\n\nEstimated Cost\n\n\n\n610910-100002\n\nFranklinton Area Storm Sewer Rehabilitation\n\nConstruction Administration & Inspection \n\n$650,000.00 \n\n\n\n611031-100000\n\nST-21, ST-22, ST-23 Improvements\n\nEngineering Contract Modification\n\n$650,000.00 \n\n\n\n611037-100000\n\nKrieger Court Stormwater Improvements\n\nConstruction Administration & Inspection \n\n$558,000.00 \n\n\n\n611040-100000\n\nBarnett Road Stormwater Improvements Project\n\nConstruction Administration & Inspection \n\n$570,000.00 \n\n\n\n650033-100002\n\nBig Walnut Sanitary Trunk Extension, Phase 2\n\nConstruction Administration & Inspection \n\n$3,800,000.00 \n\n\n\n650033-100002\n\nBig Walnut Sanitary Trunk Extension, Phase 2\n\nEngineering Contract Modification\n\n$1,500,000.00 \n\n\n\n650234-100200\n\nDOSD Roof Replacements, No. 3\n\nConstruction\n\n$3,000,000.00 \n\n\n\n650240-100000\n\nJPWWTP Digester Improvements \n\nEngineering/Design\n\n$3,311,000.00 \n\n\n\n650353-100007\n\nSWWTP Organics Receiving and Bioengery Utilization Facility\n\nEngineering/Design\n\n$14,472,000.00 \n\n\n\n650378-100001\n\nSWWTP Plant Wide Control System Improvements\n\nEngineering Contract Modification\n\n$1,424,280.00 \n\n\n\n650491-100007\n\nIntermodal Sanitary Subtrunk Extension\n\nConstruction Administration & Inspection\n\n$2,000,000.00 \n\n\n\n650725-100018\n\nNear North & East Area Large Diameter Assessment -

Water; OWDA Direct Loan - Sanitary; and OWDA Direct Loan - Storm.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to apply for, accept, and enter into loan agreements with the Ohio Water Development Authority for capital improvement projects; to designate a dedicated source of repayment for the loans; and to authorize the establishment of new Fund Numbers for these loans.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities anticipates preparing loan applications to submit to the OWDA Direct loan program for the projects and project phases listed in the Background Section of this ordinance to finance, through below-market interest rate loans, capital improvement projects under the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and the Division of Water, which said financial assistance may be of help in reducing total project costs to the City's Sewerage, Stormwater, and Water customers; and\n \nWHEREAS, it may become necessary to add or subtract to the list of projects anticipated to apply for OWDA Direct loan financing due to schedule adjustments or departmental need; and\n \nWHEREAS, new Fund Numbers are required to be established so financial tracking of this new category of loans from OWDA Direct can be tracked in the City’s financial system separately from the current source of loan funding provided jointly by the Ohio EPA/OWDA; and    \n \nWHEREAS, it will be necessary to repay any loans obtained; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities to authorize the Director to apply for, accept and enter into loans with the Ohio Water Development Authority to finance Department of Public Utilities capital improvement projects; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to apply for, accept, and enter into loan agreements with the Ohio Water Development Authority for the financing of capital improvement projects.\n \nSECTION 2.  City Council understands and agrees that the list of projects, phases, and costs in the Background Section of this ordinance are the anticipated projects, phases, and costs; that projects and phases may be added to or subtracted from the list due to schedule changes or department need; that the prices are estimates that will change based upon bid results and/or contract negotiations; and City Council authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to make changes to the list through 3/31/24 as the Director of Public Utilities deems necessary without seeking City Council approval for the changes and without amending this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That Sewerage System Service Charges are hereby authorized to be the dedicated source of repayment for the Sanitary and Treatment Engineering projects submitted for OWDA Direct loan funding under this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 4.  That Stormwater Fees are hereby authorized to be the dedicated source of repayment for the Stormwater projects submitted for OWDA Direct loan funding under this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 5.  That city water rate revenues are hereby authorized to be the dedicated source of repayment for the Division of Water projects submitted for OWDA Direct loan funding under this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor and the Director of Finance and Management are authorized to establish new fund numbers as requested and needed for the OWDA Direct Loan Program.\n \nSECTION 7.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 8.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
