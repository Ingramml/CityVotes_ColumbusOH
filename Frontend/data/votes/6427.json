    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes a sponsorship/grant in the amount of $10,000.00 between CelebrateOne and the National African American Male Wellness Agency, a 501(c)(3) Not for Profit, in support of the 2023 Uplift Her Annual Women's Health Day.\nThis event will offer free health screenings, vaccinations, and fun physical activities to participants. Also, Uplift Her will be honoring women that make an impact in the community. The event is free and open to the public on June 22, 2023 at St.Charles Preparatory School in Bexley, Ohio.\nOn average, Black women are more likely to experience chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. They also face higher rates of maternal mortality, infant mortality, and other reproductive health issues. These health disparities are largely attributed to social determinants of health, such as poverty, lack of access to quality health care, and discrimination. Access to quality health care is a significant factor in improving the health outcomes of Black women. However, systemic barriers, such as racial bias and discrimination, limit access to care and negatively impact the quality of care received. \nFiscal Impact: Funding in the amount of $10,000.00 is available within the CelebrateOne division budget within the General Fund 1000. A transfer of cash, authority, and appropriation within Fund 1000 is necessary in order to align the sponsorship grant with Grants and Service Contracts Awarded to Not-for-Profits by the City Procedure issued February 20, 2023 by the City Auditor.\nGrant Recipient:  National African American Male Wellness Agency, Vendor #008384, exp. 5/16/2024.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of CelebrateOne to enter into a sponsorship grant agreement with the National African American Male Wellness Agency in support of the 2023 Uplift Her 2nd Annual Women's Health Day; to authorize the transfer of $10,000.00 cash, authority, and appropriation within the General Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of $10,000.00 within the General Fund.
