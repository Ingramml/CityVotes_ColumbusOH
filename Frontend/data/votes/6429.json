    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes a grant in the amount of $10,000.00 between CelebrateOne and South Side Thrive Collaborative, a 501(c)(3) Not for Profit.\nThe mission of South Side Thrive is to support South Side residents in living healthy, fulfilling lives by strengthening the collective efforts of community partners. South Side Thrive Collaborative convenes stakeholders to enhance the overall quality of life of South Side residents and support residents’ holistic needs.\nMore than 60% of households in the South Side are living under 200% of the Federal Poverty Line. Compared to the rest of Franklin County, South Side residents experience overall higher rates of diabetes, chronic disease, and infant mortality.\nSouth Side Thrive Collaborative launched a community-wide awareness building initiative to support residents in preventing and/or managing chronic medical conditions, encouraging healthy habits, and promoting wellness. The healthy living outreach campaign was designed to reduce health disparities through culturally sensitive outreach and awareness building activities that connect South Side residents with limited financial resources to local wellness programs and services.\nFiscal Impact: Funding in the amount of $10,000.00 is available within the CelebrateOne division budget within the General Fund 1000. A transfer of cash, authority, and appropriation within Fund 1000 is necessary in order to align the grant with Grants and Service Contracts Awarded to Not-for-Profits by the City Procedure issued February 20, 2023 by the City Auditor.\nGrant Recipient:  South Side Thrive Collaborative, Not for Profit Vendor #043563, exp. 11/3/2024.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of CelebrateOne to enter into a not-for-profit grant agreement with the South Side Thrive Collaborative to support their healthy living outreach campaign to reduce health care disparities for residents living in the City's South Side; to authorize the transfer of $10,000.00 cash, authority, and appropriation within the General Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of $10,000.00 within the General Fund.
