    "description": "Explanation\nTo authorize the City Auditor to enter into contract with OnActuate Consulting Inc. and provide funding for operational maintenance of Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain (D365) and Point of Sale (POS); to authorize the expenditure of up to $648,000.00, from the Department of Technology operating fund for a total expenditure of $648,000.00; and to declare an emergency ($648,000.00). OnActuate, our Microsoft partner of record, is sole source as it owns intellectual property rights for Point of Sale and multiple Vendor Collaboration extensions critical to continued operation of the City’s D365 Financial System.\nOperational support of Dynamics 365 includes support for D365 Finance and Supply Chain as well as Point of Sale. Support includes work item (defect) analysis and resolution, backlog operational work item analysis and resolution, technical support for reported issues, maintenance of development servers, deployable packages for City of Columbus extensions, and D365 yearly release support, mandated monthly Microsoft proactive quality updates (new in 2023), testing and remediation as required for D365 Finance and Supply Chain and Point of Sale.\nEmergency action is requested in order to continue services for the City's financial system, Dynamics 365, without interruption.  We are currently managing technical changes related to D365 Release 10.0.33.  Delay of this effort would put financial transactions at risk such as vendor payments, PO confirmations and recording of revenue in a timely manner. In addition, should issues arise with the Point of Sale system, it would be unsupported during the gap period in the contract.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Info Services Operating fund, Dept of Technology Operating subfund.    \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 027985 and expires 06/28/2023.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to enter into contract with OnActuate Consulting Inc. in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Code; and provide funding for operational maintenance of Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain (D365) and Point of Sale (POS); to authorize the expenditure of up to $648,000.00, from the Department of Technology operating fund for a total expenditure of $648,000.00; and to declare an emergency ($648,000.00).\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the City Auditor to enter into contract with OnActuate Consulting, for operational support of Dynamics 365 and Point of Sale as a sole source provider; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $648,000.00; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Auditor’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to enter into contract for operational support of Dynamics 365 and Point of Sale so there is no interruption in service because any delay would put financial transactions at risk such as vendor payments, PO confirmations and recording of revenue in a timely manner; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to enter into contract with OnActuate Consulting, for operational support of Dynamics 365 and Point of Sale for the City of Columbus.  \nSECTION 2.

That this purchase is in accordance with relevant provisions of the Columbus City Code, “Sole Source Procurement.” \n \nSECTION 4. That the sum of $648,000.00 is for operational support of Dynamics 365 and Point of Sale. \n \nSECTION 5. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby authorized for expenditure and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding contract or contract associated with the expenditure of the funds. \n \nSECTION 7. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this resolution is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
