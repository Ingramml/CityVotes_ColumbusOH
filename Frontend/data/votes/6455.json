    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a contract with OARnet/OSU, a non-profit organization, for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support services. The original agreement (EL011737) was authorized by ordinance 1716-2010, passed December 13, 2010. The agreement was most recently renewed by authority of ordinance 0773-2022, passed by Columbus City Council on April 18, 2022. The total cost associated with this ordinance is $406,689.34 for the coverage term period from April 2, 2023 to April 1, 2024.\n \nThrough the State of Ohio Virtualization Program, OARnet offers significant discounts on VMWare that are not available in the market place. As such, it is in the City’s best interests to procure VMWare through OARnet, rather than another procurement process. The pricing offered to the City reflects the agreed upon public sector discounts available to all participants in the State of Ohio Virtualization Program. \n \nServer virtualization is the conversion of one physical server into multiple individual and isolated virtual storage spaces. This industry standard was adopted by the Department of Technology in 2009 to reduce the costs of Data Center operations. This also reduces power consumption, cooling requirements, and provides further capabilities for recovery and availability of information systems. VMWare software is the core component that is needed in order to operate virtual servers that run critical applications for the enterprise such as Accela, CUBS, and 311.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $406,689.34 for the above-described purpose.\n \nNOT-FOR-PROFIT CONTRACT INFORMATION\nThis agreement is being awarded under City Code section 329.30, which prescribes the method for contracting with not-for-profit organizations. DoT and OarNet negotiated the cost for provision of the above-described services, the costs for which are outlined in the attachment to this ordinance. The services being authorized herein include VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the above-described services are budgeted and available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor name: OARnet/OSU, 1224 Kinnear Rd Ste. 130, Columbus, OH 43212; CC#/FID#: 31-6025986; DAX Vendor Acct. #: 006163; Expiration Date: Non-Profit Organization (NPO)\n \nEMERGENCY\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation. The current contract expires on April 1, 2023. To ensure a contract for the provision of Vmware services is in place by the time the current contract expires, emergency action is necessary.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into an agreement with OARnet/OSU for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support, pursuant to Columbus City Codes sections relating to not-for-profit service contracts; to authorize the expenditure of $406,689.34 from the Department of Technology Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($406,689.34)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the city has a need for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support; and\n \nWHEREAS, OARnet/OSU, a local non-profit educational institute, provides the above-described service; and\n \nWHEREAS, On December 13, 2010, Ordinance 1716-2010 passed, authorizing the initial contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Technology wishes to continue to obtain services from OARnet/OSU for the above-described services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology enter into contract with OARnet/OSU for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support, pursuant to Columbus City Codes sections relating to not-for-profit service contracts, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\nSECTION 1.

That the expenditure of up to $406,689.34, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized as provided on the attachment to this ordinance. (See attachment 0887-2023EXP).\n \nSECTION 3. That this agreement is being awarded under City Code section 329.30, which prescribes the method for contracting with not-for-profit organizations.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.
