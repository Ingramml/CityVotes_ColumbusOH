Finally, this ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $120,000.00 to fund this program through the Human Resources Citywide Training and Development Office.\n \nThe Citywide Training & Development Manager, in consultation with the Human Resources Director, conducted a search process for executive coaching programs.  The process included researching best practices and  accessing the International Coaching Federation (ICF) Website and researching profiles of executive coaches based on the following preferred criteria: Master-level coaching certification; experience coaching c-suite and senior leaders;  public sector working experience; established customer base with recommendations; and more than 5 years coaching experience.  In addition to the profiles of individual coaches, established executive coaching companies were also reviewed for consideration. Interviews were conducted with six reputable executive coaching companies who met the preferred criteria.  During the interviews, the areas of coaching methodology, executive coaching program options, and fee estimates were discussed in detail.  Upon careful consideration of all the information collected, The Bridgefield Group was selected as the best and most cost-effective executive coaching program for the City of Columbus.  Competitive bidding requirements are being waived as it is in the best interests of the City and the Human resources Department to begin these sessions as quickly as possible.   \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so the leadership coaching sessions can begin immediately.  Each of the two groups of coaching sessions will take six months.\n \nFiscal Impact: $120,000.00 is available in 2023 for transfer from Finance and Management Department, Division of Financial Management, Citywide Account.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the general fund, from the Department of Finance and Management, Division of Financial Management, to the Department of Human Resources, general fund, to allow the Human Resources Director to contract with the Bridgefield Group, an executive coaching company; to authorize the City Auditor to set up a certificate in the amount of $120,000.00 for this program; and to authorize the expenditure of $120,000.00 from the general fund for the purpose described above; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
