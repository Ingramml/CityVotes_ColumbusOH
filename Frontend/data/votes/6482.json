    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and honor May 2023 as Brain Cancer Awareness Month in Columbus, Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, according to the American Association for Cancer Research, this year more than 26,000 people in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with brain cancer and other nervous system cancers. These cancers make up a portion of the approximately 93,470 brain tumors that will be diagnosed in this country annually; and\n \nWHEREAS, Brain Cancer Awareness Month, or Brain Tumor Awareness Month, was launched in 2004 by a coalition of charities that went on to become founding members of Brain Tumour Research; and\n \nWHEREAS, approximately 700,000 individuals in the United States are currently living with brain cancer; and\n \nWHEREAS, in the United States, brain tumors are the leading cause of death from cancer in children who are under 14 years of age and teens who are under 19 years of age. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of death from cancer in young adults who are between 15 and 39 years of age; and\n \nWHEREAS, funding for brain cancer research is critical, as the treatment of brain tumors is complicated by the fact that more than 100 types of brain tumors exist. Treatment and removal of brain tumors present significant challenges due to the uniquely complex and fragile nature of the brain; and\n \nWHEREAS, brain tumor research is considered poorly funded compared to other types of cancer, despite how common it is and how many deaths it causes; and\n \nWHEREAS, Great Minds is a local organization fighting to end brain cancer through community support, events full of hope, and fundraising for more and better brain cancer research; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council encourages increased public awareness of brain tumors to honor individuals who have lost their lives to a brain tumor or currently live with a brain tumor diagnosis; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize May 2023 as Brain Cancer Awareness Month in Columbus, Ohio and honors our resilient and incredible residents who are fighting brain cancer.",
