    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Tyevco for the Glenwood Park Natural Area Improvements Project. The contract amount is $282,690.00, with a contingency of $75,000.00, for a total of $357,690.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $359,690.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThis ordinance will enable improvements to an eight acre natural area of Glenwood Park that is adjacent to Broad Street. The construction will include an ADA accessible natural trail, including vernal pool and wetland enhancements. The project will also include improvements to park signage and park amenities. Improved park boundaries will also be established by this project, improving the aesthetics along the entrance into the Hilltop Neighborhood along the Broad Street frontage of this park. Access and safety to this area of the park will also be improved by replacing deteriorated stairs. Safety will further be improved by removing trash and debris, including homeless camps. \n \nFor years, the local community has advocated for beautification of the Greater Hilltop Area as presented in the Envision Hilltop: A Community Plan for Shared Success (https://www.envisionhilltop.com/). Neighborhood volunteer groups, including Friends of Glenwood Park and the Highland West Civic Association, have partnered with the City to remove litter, invasive plant species, as well as dead, dying, and diseased trees. These efforts reflect the Hilltop Community’s desire to revitalize this underutilized eight acre natural space of Glenwood Park. The goals to be achieved with improving Glenwood Park include creating additional safer access points, improving the line of sight in the park, and enhancing overall site safety for the community. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on March 7, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 28, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nTyevco (MAJ): $282,690.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Tyevco was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Tyevco and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTyevco Inc.\n1678 West Audubon Boulevard\nLancaster, Ohio 43130                                                      \nScott Boggess, (614) 284-0251                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number: 005691\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 27, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to address safety concerns related to the existing deteriorated stairs, poor visibility within the park, and frequent loitering between Broad Street and the Glenwood Community Center as quickly as possible, creating a safe ADA accessible natural area for park users to experience.  \n \nBenefits to the Public: In addition to the safety improvements mentioned above, this project will benefit the community by providing a safe, ADA accessible, and fun space for the community. The project will provide a place for children to play and adults to passively recreate. It will also provide educational components of the natural resources in the area, such as wetlands and tree species, to support the neighborhoods knowledge of these resources. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The concept of the improving the Glenwood Park Natural Area has been discussed by the Greater Hilltop Area Commission, the Highland West Civic Association, and friends of groups within this area for the past five years.  Over the past 24 months, there have been monthly meetings with these groups and staff has visited groups separately at their monthly scheduled meetings. These groups are supportive of the construction as well as providing volunteer support. Community input for these improvements has been strong from the Hilltop Area. The community has long been waiting for this construction project that addresses the poor visibility and access of the 8 acres of lower lying areas of Glenwood Park.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Greater Hilltop (53)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the mission of the Recreation and Parks Master Plan to provide quality recreational parks, trails, and easy, all-age connectivity for Columbus residents.\n \nFiscal Impact: $359,690.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Tyevco for the Glenwood Park Natural Area Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $359,690.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $359,690.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
