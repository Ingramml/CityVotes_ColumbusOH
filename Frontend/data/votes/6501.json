    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services desires to enter into a Subrecipient Agreement - Not-for-Profit Service Contract with Creating Central Ohio Futures (CCOF) for its Building Back Better Together (3BT) program, in an amount not to exceed $500,000.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, to provide job training and placement assistance services and authorize reimbursement for services retroactive to January 1, 2023. \n \nOrdinance No. 1201-2021 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate approximately $187,030,138.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds as signed into law by the President of the United States on March 11, 2021.\n \nMany workers lost jobs or had their hours reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some have found new jobs while others have not and may still be unemployed or underemployed.  The 3BT program works to educate program participants by providing training and job-related education, including soft skill development, financial literacy assistance, practical experience, individualized support, and industry recognized training certifications. CCOF leverages relationships with industry-specific partners for program recruitment and opportunities for post-graduation. 3BT participants will emerge ready to pursue a career in a job that provides economic security for years to come.\n \n3BT participants who meet attendance and performance standards will receive a $150 weekly stipend and may also receive up to $750 in emergency financial assistance with childcare, transportation, and sealing of criminal records.  \n \nThese services are being contracted out, as the department does not have the resources to operate or manage this program internally\n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will be modified while this contract is in effect, and it is requested that the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services be given the authority to modify the terms and conditions of the contract without seeking additional Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.\n \nCreating Central Ohio Futures is a not-for-profit organization supported in part by the City of Columbus and Franklin County, and the Building Back Better Together program serves residents of the City of Columbus.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency, to reimburse CCOF for services they have already provided, and to allow CCOF to quickly resume this programming for participants to improve their lives and the lives of their families through additional and marketable work skill training. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress and signed into law March 11, 2021. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 035877 and contract compliance is pending.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to execute a Subrecipient Agreement - Not-for-Profit Service Contract with Creating Central Ohio Futures (CCOF) for its Building Back Better Together (3BT) program, in an amount not to exceed $500,000.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, to provide job training and placement assistance services; to authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify the terms and conditions of the Subrecipient Agreement - Not-for-Profit Service Contract as needed without seeking further City Council approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance from the federal government; to authorize reimbursement retroactive to January 1, 2023; to authorize the program’s issuance of stipends to program participants; to authorize the program’s issuance of emergency assistance funds to program participants; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $500,000.00 of ARPA funds; and to declare an emergency.
