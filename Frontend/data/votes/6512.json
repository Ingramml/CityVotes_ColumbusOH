    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to modify the term of an existing non-profit service agreement with Pro-Choice Ohio to examine the activities of crisis pregnancy centers. Funding for this agreement was established via Ordinance No. 2215-2022 passed on July 27, 2022. The current agreement expired on March 31, 2023. This modification will extend the grant terms until August 31, 2023.
