    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with MKSK to provide professional design services for the West Case Park Design Project. The modification amount is $1,293,000.00 and a contingency of $82,000.00, for a total of $1,375,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nIn 2018, the Recreation and Parks Department acquired the former Ohio State University Agriculture Extension Sheep Farm at 2425 West Case Road. For several years, the Recreation and Parks Department had identified the 58 acre site as a key community park space as the parcel is one of the largest remaining undeveloped open spaces in the entire Northwest Community. At the same time, the surrounding neighborhoods have played an active role by providing support for the City’s investment to buy the site and develop a signature green space for a highly underserved area for greenspace. The property is surrounded by high density housing, with over 1,000 households within a 10 minute walk. The Carriage Place Community Center is also within 200 yards of the parkland.\n \nIn October of 2021, Ordinance 1182-2021 authorized the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with MKSK to perform the master planning of West Case Park. This contract included conceptual designs for the 58 acre park. It also included conducting two community open houses, user surveys, coordination with other city departments, cost estimating, programming analysis, and interaction with key stakeholders involved in the park development. Construction of the park and Forestry Section facility is currently projected to begin in 2024.\n \nThis ordinance is to authorize a planned contract modification to perform the final design and bid documents for the parkland, including the Forestry Section facility to be located on the site. The park improvements include athletic fields, sport courts, play spaces, over 1.5 miles of pathways, nearby neighborhood walk connections, shelters, parking, entry drives from West Case Road, native plantings, wetland improvements, and site furniture. The Forestry Section facility includes staff facilities, storage, and equipment staging areas.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMKSK, Inc.\n462 Ludlow Alley\nColumbus, OH 43215                                                      \nBrian Kinzelman, (614) 621-2796\nContract Compliance Number: 028341\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: October 25, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to finalize the detailed design and to complete all required environmental permitting commitments on the site before the onset of the winter season, allowing construction to proceed at the earliest practical time so the community can benefit from the improvements. Community input for these improvements was gathered in 2021 and the funding for this project was just recently authorized. The community has been waiting for these improvements and, without this design contract in place as soon as possible, these needed improvements will not be completed in a manner that would benefit the park users and community.\n \nBenefits to the Public: West Case Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the entire northwest region of the City of Columbus. The scale of this park will accommodate a wide range of passive and active recreation for all ages. The park will be designed to maximize walking and biking access, taking advantage of the close proximity to Carriage Place Community Center and making it easily accessible to over 1,000 nearby households.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since 2017, the local communities have been extensively engaged with the Recreation and Parks Department in the acquisition and development of this greenspace. The Department has engaged with the Northwest Civic Association, Ohio State University, Don Scott Airport, civic groups, and residents surrounding the parkland.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northwest (34)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Department Master Plan by providing quality parks and trails while adding easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $235,825.00 was legislated for the West Case Park Development Project by Ordinance 1182-2021. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $1,375,000.00. $1,375,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,610,825.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with MKSK for the West Case Park Design Project; to authorize the transfer of $1,375,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $1,375,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
