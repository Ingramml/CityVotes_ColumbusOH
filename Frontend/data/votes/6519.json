    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc., for the Professional Construction Management Services (PCM) - 2020 Project in an amount up to $9,421,900.00.\n \nThis Professional Construction Management (PCM) contract assists the City with managing a capital improvement program consisting of multiple capital improvement projects to ensure completion in accordance with design requirements and City’s needs, while serving as a liaison between the construction contractor, design professional (DP), and City personnel.  Work performed to date includes program support services, design phase construction management services (e.g., construction cost estimating, constructability reviews, and construction scheduling), and construction administration / construction inspection (CA/CI) services.  Future phases of the contact will continue these same services.\n \nThe Notice to Proceed (NTP) for the original contract occurred in December 2020.  Construction projects will be assigned to this contract based on their advertisement date using a three year assignment period that starts at this contract’s NTP date; thus, the assignment period is anticipated to run from December 2020 to December 2023.\n     \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1 Future Renewals:  Funds will be authorized through annual contract renewals (or more frequent renewals if required by fiscal needs). The PCM team will provide construction services through completion of the last construction project assigned to this contract.  Thus, the end date for this contract will depend on the construction duration of the last construction project assigned.\n \n1.2 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $9,421,900.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                             $  2,442,500.00\nRenewal #1:                     $  6,826,100.00\nRenewal #2:                     $  7,371,100.00\nRenewal #3 (current):                     $  9,421,900.00\nRenewal #4 (future):                     $  7,500,000.00\nRenewal #5 (future):                                                 $  6,000,000.00                     \nRenewal #6 (future):                                                 $  3,000,000.00\nContract Total:                     $42,561,600.00\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  The current consultant has already provided both design phase and construction phase services for all the projects assigned to this contract.  Bidding this work out to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the work already performed and would interrupt construction phase services for projects currently under construction.  \n \n1.4. How the cost of renewal was determined:  The City identified the services that would be needed for each project over the renewal period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services.  The proposal was reviewed by the City’s project personnel and subsequently revised by the consultant based on the City’s comments.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis PCM contract will support various projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects will maintain and upgrade drinking water supply and treatment facilities to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the central Ohio area.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \nMost projects will be located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public and for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for projects that impact the public.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying Department of Public Utilities environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHill International’s contract compliance number is CC-000990 and expires 12/8/23.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) are not required for this contract as no Federal or State funds will be expended on the contract.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Hill International is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Hill International plans to utilize City-certified MBE/WBE firms to perform 21.4% of the dollar amount of the work of this contract renewal, amounting to $2,016,286.60 of the $9,421,900.00 renewal amount. \nAs part of their proposal, Hill International, Inc. has proposed the following seven subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                           City/State                       ODI Certification Status \nDynotec, Inc                                                                                                     Columbus                                                                            MBE\nResource International, Inc                                                  Columbus                                                                                     WBE\nAscension Construction Solutions                             Columbus                                                                                     MBE\nG.

to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew and increase a professional engineering services agreement with Hill International for the Professional Construction Management Services - 2020 Project; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $9,421,900.00 from the Water Bond Fund to pay for the renewal.  ($9,421,900.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Contract No’s PO255315, PO255328, PO255330, PO255406, PO255408, PO255409, PO255410, PO255412, PO255413, PO255414, PO255415, PO255416, PO255417, PO255419, PO255420, PO255421, PO255422, PO255423 were authorized by Ordinance No. 2380-2020 passed by City Council on November 19, 2020;
