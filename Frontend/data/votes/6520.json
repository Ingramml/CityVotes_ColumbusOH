    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Complete General Corporation for the Large Diameter Valve Replacement, Part 3 Project, CIP #690589-100002, in an amount up to $4,686,561.65, and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00 for the project.\n \nWork consists of the installation of new and/or replacement of large diameter valves (20 inch through 24inch diameter) and associated work including linestops, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract, in accordance with the drawings, technical specifications, special provisions, and City of Columbus Construction and Material Specifications as set forth in the Invitation For Bid.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “55 - Downtown.”  Work limits include 4th Street from Broad Street to Fulton Street and the intersection of Fulton Street and S. High Street.\n \nFunding for this construction contract is anticipated to be done in the form of a loan from the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  The OWDA’s mission is to provide financial assistance for environmental infrastructure from the sale of municipal revenue bonds through loans to local governments in Ohio.  These loans are available at interest rates below what the City can obtain through a bond sale.  Ordinance 0997-2023 is pending City Council approval for the Department of Public Utilities to obtain loans directly from OWDA.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project involves repairs to valves on critical large diameter water mains and will improve the reliability of the water distribution system.  Coordination will occur with nearby customers, including businesses, prior to and during construction.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Large Diameter Valve Replacement, Part 3 Project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 1/20/23 through 2/15/23.  One bid was received for the project and was opened on 2/15/23.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                                                   Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\nComplete General Construction                          $4,686,561.65                     CC-006056                                          MAJ\n \nThe Complete General bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $4,686,561.65.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nComplete General Construction’s contract compliance number is CC-006056 and expires 06/08/2023.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Complete General Construction.\n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 12% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 12% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nAs part of their proposal, Complete General Construction has proposed the following four subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nCAP-STONE & Associates, Inc.                 Columbus, Ohio                                                       WBE\nMcDaniels Construction                                                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                MBE\nBridges Bros.
