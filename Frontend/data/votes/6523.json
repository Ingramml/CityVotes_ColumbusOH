    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Green Columbus in support of their Urban Tree Nursery initiative and Earth Day 2023. \n \nThe founders of Green Columbus started Earth Day Columbus (EDC) while dreaming of a world where resources for “green” projects are accessible to all. Instead of hosting events in already-strong communities, Green Columbus wants to empower new communities to develop green infrastructure. During April, Green Columbus works to provide 100+ community worksites with tools, supplies, soil & mulch, trees, pollinator plants, prairie seed mix, volunteer rewards, volunteers, and small corporate sponsorships to cover costs. The beautification of the city results in a strong sense of community pride, self-sufficiency, and resiliency among residents. \n \nGreen Columbus worksites include many cleanups, plantings, and workdays at community-run gardens. In a time of rising inflation and occurrence of food deserts, this is the only source of fresh produce for numerous families. Many of these groups have come to depend on EDC for their annual garden preparation.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide Green Columbus with the resources necessary to execute Earth Day 2023 activities.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Green Columbus in support of their Urban Tree Nursery initiative and Earth Day 2023; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($40,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the founders of Green Columbus started Earth Day Columbus while dreaming of a world where resources for “green” projects are accessible to all; and\n \nWHEREAS, during April, Green Columbus works to provide 100+ community worksites with tools, supplies, soil & mulch, trees, pollinator plants, prairie seed mix, volunteer rewards, volunteers, and small corporate sponsorships to cover cost; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily business of the city in that it is immediately necessary to authorize a grant agreement with Green Columbus in order to provide the resources necessary to execute Earth Day 2023 activities; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
