    "description": "Title\nTo Designate May 15th -19th as Trauma-Informed Awareness Week in the City of Columbus and Recognize the Work of the Columbus CARE Coalition\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Trauma-informed care is an approach that can bring greater understanding and more effective ways to prevent, identify, support and service children, adults, families, and communities affected by adverse childhood experiences, trauma, adversity, and toxic stress; and\n \nWHEREAS, Trauma-informed care is not a therapy or an intervention, but a principle-based, culture-change process aimed at recognizing strengths and resiliency as well as helping people who have experienced trauma to overcome those issues in order to lead healthy and positive lives; and\n \nWHEREAS, Trauma-informed care is essential to our overall health, and the importance of attending to mental health has become even more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not only negatively impacted many people’s mental health but has also created barriers to treatment; the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and many other agencies and organizations provide substance resources to better engage individuals and communities across the United States in order to implement trauma-informed care; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus CARE Coalition provides hope and healing to individuals, families, and neighbors experiencing trauma through various workshops focused on trauma training, racial trauma and networking and by offering support in communities following a traumatic event, including canvassing neighborhoods post-homicide in Linden, Southside, and Hilltop; and\n \nWHEREAS, research in public health, neuroscience, molecular biology, and genomics over the last two decades reveals that experiences in the first few years of life alters the human body’s biology that, in turn, influences the individual’s physical and mental health over the course of their lifetime; and\n \nWHEREAS, A trauma-informed Columbus enhances the ability of children and adults to adapt, cope and thrive despite difficult times, supporting the mental well-being of everyone in our city; now therefore, \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby designate May 15th-19th as Trauma-informed Awareness Week in the City of Columbus and recognize the work of the Columbus CARE Coalition.",
