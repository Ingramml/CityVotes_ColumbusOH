    "description": "Background\nThis legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 3289-2021, passed by Columbus City Council on December 13, 2021, which authorized the Board of Health to enter into grant agreements with several entities that align with the efforts of The Commission on Black Girls.  This Ordinance is necessary to allow the grants that were being managed by Columbus Public Health to be moved under the purview of the Department of Neighborhoods. The Commission on Black Girls transitioned from Columbus Public Health to the Department of Neighborhoods in June 2022, to better align with the City’s programming. The transfer of these grants will accommodate the transition and allow grants to be executed, modified, and managed by the Department of Neighborhoods. \n \nIt is necessary to extend two grants which were not finalized until April 2022; therefore, the programs were not afforded the appropriate time needed to expend the funds and convene program activities.  Additionally, three grant agreements were not executed because of The Commission on Black Girls’ transition to the Department of Neighborhoods. This Ordinance would allow those grant agreements to be executed so program activities can take place in 2023.  This legislation will not require additional funding, but will allow programs to expend the remaining balance of the funding that was awarded in the initial ordinance (3289-2021).  These grants will necessitate advance payment.\n \nPhysicians CareConnection in partnership with Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. - Sigma Iota Zeta Chapter\nPhysicians CareConnection will serve as the fiscal agent for Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. - Sigma Iota Zeta Chapter in order for the organization to receive funding for their existing youth services which focuses on enrichment programs for Black girls.   Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. - Sigma Iota Zeta Chapter positively impacts the community with informative programming focused on health, education, youth development and empowerment as well as social justice. The chapter is continuously driven to uphold and uplift the sorority’s principles of scholarship, service, finer womanhood and sisterhood.  Funding will be used for Sigma Iota Zeta Chapter’s auxiliary youth groups including- Amicae, Archonettes, Amicettes and Pearlettes. Program expenses will include food for participants as permitted under City Code Section 329.35(B)(1) for a public purpose.  \n \n \nThe Ohio State University\nThe Ohio State University established a program creating opportunities for healing with a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention with justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers. Dr. Stephanie Powers-Carter, a professor at the OSU College of  Human Ecology will lead the project working in conjunction with Dr. Camille R. Quinn, a licensed independent social worker and former assistant professor at The Ohio State University.  The project was developed by Dr. Quinn. \n \nThe targeted constituents include court-involved Black girls ages 14-17 who are also disproportionately affected by PTSD, with 70% of girls with histories of sexual or physical abuse as well as their parents/caregivers. The parent/caregiver-child dyads (there will be 5 dyads) will undergo a stress reduction intervention, i.e., Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) that shows promise for addressing PTSD. MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology, which is linked to delinquency and other risky behaviors. MBSR may help modulate the dysregulated stress response in the body to improve physical and mental health concurrently.\n \nThe intervention seeks to disrupt girls engaging in behaviors that could lead to them returning to the juvenile justice system. Project expenses may include food used for mindful eating exercises with the intervention participants, as permitted in City Code Section 329.35(B)(1).\n \nBumblebeez\nBumblebeez is a non-profit mentoring program for African-American girls ages 10-13 years of age.  Its purpose is to provide young ladies with resources and information to combat the many social and emotional issues girls face daily.  The program provides girls with leadership and team-building skills, as well as promotes self-esteem through a series of workshops over a 10-month period.  These workshops are designed to approach topics from a dual perspective as the program addresses communication, self-image, finances, health and fitness, government & social activism and sisterly love.\n \nBumblebeez intends to inspire generations of girls and young women to develop a better understanding of themselves and a greater appreciation for their community and each other. Program expenses will include food for participants pursuant to City Code Section 329.35(B)(1) for a public purpose.\n \nThe Thiossane Institute\nThe Thiossane Institute was formed with the express purpose of bringing authentic West African cultural representation to a variety of local, national, and international communities. Thiossane introduces the richness of West African culture through dance and music to create a space of learning and growth in traditional African culture.\n \nThe Thiossane Institute’s Ready Set, G.R.O.W. program focuses on pathways that provide resources of learning for quality instructional training to address job readiness, financial sustainability, and physical health and wellness. Program sessions focus on drum and dance along with offering an educational component to learn grounded principles for adult readiness.  Program expenses will include food for participants as permitted in City Code Section 329.35(B)(1) for a public purpose.  \n \n \nBrown Girls Mentoring \nBrown Girls Mentoring was founded in 2016 with a mission to equip Brown Girls with tools to build their self-confidence, develop relationships, resolve conflict, make wise decisions, work in teams, and develop practical life skills.  The program educates Brown Girls through lectures, trainings, activities, simulations, role play, and affirmations. Brown Girls Mentoring aims to empower young Brown Girls in all shades of beauty to know their worth, strive for excellence, and to embrace their natural beauty. \n \nTo help the Black girls in low resource areas of Columbus, Brown Girls Mentoring focuses on leadership development for Black Girls ages 5-16. The goal of the leadership development program is designed to:\n•                     help Black Girls find their voices\n•                      teach them how to withstand adversity and challenges\n•                     introduce them to Black female leaders and change-agents who are making their communities better\n•                      promote creative ways to make changes in their communities\nProgram expenses will include food for participants as permitted in City Code Section 329.35(B)(1) for a public purpose.  \n \n \nThe following grants will be modified and extended until August 31, 2023 in the amounts listed: \n\n\n\nProgram\n\nTotal Amount Funded\n\nRemaining grant balance\n\nPO Number\n\n\n\nBrown Girls Mentoring\n\n$52,000.00 \n\n$13,000.00\n\nPO322998\n\n\n\nThiossane Institute \n\n$51,116\n\n$12,779.00 \n\nPO323635 \n\n\n \n \nGrant agreements will be executed for the following organizations/programs in the amounts listed: \n\n\n\nOrganization/Program\n\nGrant Amount \n\n\n\nZeta Beta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.
