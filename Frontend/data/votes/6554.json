    "description": "Background\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the National African American Male Wellness Agency in support of the African American Male Wellness Walk. \n \nThe annual walk event will happen on Saturday, August 12, 2023 and will celebrate 20 years of walks with a mission to save Black Men’s lives. Over the years, the African American Male Wellness Walk has transitioned the walk event to be a fitness component to a Clinic to Community model which is the overarching foundation that provides health screenings and access to quality health care to improve the quality of life and increase life expectancy of the Black male and his family. This year the organization celebrates the impact that walk events and programs have provided for over 100,000 families and will be adding the Uplift Her Women’s Pavilion along with an enhanced Calling all Dads and Real Men Real Talk Pavilion. These additions will be incorporated to enhance a holistic approach to serve the whole family in Columbus communities, and will require additional staff, screening supplies, interactive & innovative activities, multi-generational & culturally sensitive education materials, and increased permit costs to close additional streets to accommodate these additions. \n \nThe grant funding approved by this ordinance will be used to help defray the additional costs associated with program expansion. The services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested so that grant proceeds can be provided as soon as possible as event preparation has commenced.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the transfer within and expenditure of $50,050.00 from the General Fund with the African American Male Wellness Agency in the form of a grant to support the 2023 African American Wellness Walk and associated Clinic to Community.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \nAfrican American Male Wellness Agency 008384 and is valid from 5/16/2022 - 5/16/2024\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the non-profit National African American Male Wellness Agency in support of the 2023 African American Male Wellness Walk and Clinic to Community; to authorize the transfer of $50,050.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $50,050.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
