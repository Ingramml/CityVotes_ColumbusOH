    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with numerous non-profit organizations (see Exhibit A attached to this ordinance) in support of grassroots, community-oriented events and services.\n \nColumbus City Council seeks to provide support to small, grassroots, community-oriented organizations through small, high-impact grants for programs that directly serve neighborhoods and communities in Columbus. A grant process was established to reach these organizations and achieve this goal.\n \nThe following criteria were established. All grants shall be in support of community-oriented events or services. No individual grant agreement shall exceed $25,000.00.  Grants shall be paid out at two points in time to grantees, 50% in advance and 50% after the first tranche is spent or after the first three months of the grant term. All grantees must be not-for-profit organizations as defined in City Code 329.01(ff).\n \nAn application for the grant was published on the City Council website and remained open for three weeks. City Council received 31 applications for the grant program, 29 of which met the requirements stated above. A review committee read all of the 29 eligible applications and scored them on a scale of 0 to 50 based on four criteria:\n•                     Alignment with City Council’s priorities of furthering: Affordable and Quality Housing, Good Jobs and Training, and Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods\n•                     Provision of a direct service or benefit to local community members\n•                     A clear plan and budget in place for the proposed program/event\n•                     A plan to ensure that the community will be made aware of the program/event\nFollowing an evaluation period and conversation, the committee narrowed down the group of top-scoring organizations for funding based on their geographic location, to ensure that a variety of neighborhoods and communities would be reached by the program.\n \nThe twenty-nine requests totaled $602,087.00 across all proposals. Fourteen non-profit organizations were recommended for the $250,000.00 in available funding. Eleven non-profit organizations are listed in this ordinance with funding for three organizations in two other ordinances (Ordinances 1383-2023 and 1384-2023). \n \nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested as it is immediately necessary to appropriate funds for necessary expenditures which will begin in June.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with numerous non-profit organizations to support grassroots, community-oriented services and events; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($187,600.00) (Amended by Ord. 1621-2023 passed 6/5/2023) BA\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to support small not-for-profit community organizations providing services on a grassroots level to their local neighborhood; and\n \nWHEREAS, the grants program seeks to support not-for-profit organizations whose programs align with City Council’s three priority areas in 2023 including safe and healthy neighborhoods, affordable and quality housing, and good jobs and training; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into numerous grant agreements with local not-for-profit organizations for the purpose of supporting grassroots, community-oriented events and services, totaling $187,600.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk in that it is immediately necessary to transfer and appropriate funds for necessary expenditures starting in early June; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
