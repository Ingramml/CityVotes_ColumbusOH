    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Fund the Climb, a non profit entity, for the support of the Fund the Climb Foundation.\n \nThe mission of Fund The Climb is to remove barriers that stand in the way of treatment. The target population is patients in the Columbus area seeking treatment for the disease of addiction. Patients are Medicaid recipients who cannot afford safe housing, transportation, and often basic food and personal hygiene needs.  When these needs are met, patients stay in treatment and have a better chance for successful recovery and to reenter the community.  \n \nFund The Climb Foundation assists patients in the Franklinton and surrounding areas who are seeking treatment for the disease of addiction and face barriers, such as lack of housing, transportation, food and personal hygiene needs. These areas have a high rate of drug overdose, and Fund The Climb supports patients seeking treatment. They partner with Basecamp Recovery Center, located in Franklinton, and serve Medicaid patients. The goal is to give patients a fair chance to get the help they need, and rejoin the community as healthy and contributing members. These efforts will strengthen our communities and help take people from poverty to more successful lives.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure timely funding to Fund the Climb to proceed with the housing and transportation for residents suffering from addiction, as patients are waiting for units to be furnished and habitable.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Fund the Climb for the support of the Fund the Climb Foundation; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
