    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with KNS Services (KNS) for continued surveillance system replacement and repair in accordance with the sole source procurement provisions of City Code Chapter 329. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $200,000.00.\n \nKNS has provided surveillance system installation and repair for the department for many years.  They also service many other city departments including Public Safety, Finance, and Public Utilities. They have established a unique relationship with the Department of Technology to provide robust service to multiple departments in the city. The City of Columbus selected the Genetec software platform years ago for all departments to utilize for their surveillance systems with the vision of aggregating these services citywide. This effort has resulted in KNS becoming the provider of these services for several departments as Genetec requires the equipment to be maintained by KNS Services to avoid a situation where multiple vendors are given security clearance to access and make changes to the system.\n \nKNS has designed, installed, and serviced most of the Recreation and Parks Department’s security surveillance systems as they are the sole provider of the Genetec system and the licensed proprietary software the system uses. Providing integration and management of our systems into centralized access helps provide the Department of Public Safety with access to our video. As an authorized Genetec provider, KNS provides all software updates, firmware updates, coordination with Public Safety, and virtual server support through the Department of Technology. There isn’t another vendor in the area who has the capability to keep our systems updated and functioning to the level required and the use of the Genetec platform for surveillance integration citywide was made years ago by City of Columbus leadership.\n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department owns 55 unique surveillance systems comprised of 508 cameras around the City of Columbus. Most of these systems are on the Genetec platform, which provides remote viewing, access management, and organizational integration. With a robust and aging surveillance system, there is regularly a need to replace, upgrade, or repair failed equipment and components of the system. There are also regular needs to add equipment to our over 400 parks as usage and park activity changes. This contract will be used continuously throughout the year to address needs and improve safety and security throughout our park system.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nKNS Services Inc.\n8450 Rausch Drive\nPlain City, Ohio 43064                                                  \nNathan Bladen, (614) 733-3880                                                                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 005443\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: February 22, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the timely execution of this contract, avoiding a lapse in the ability for surveillance systems to be repaired or replaced immediately for the benefit of public safety. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract will provide higher reliability of all of our surveillance systems to assist in minimizing crime in our facilities and parks.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: We receive hundreds of calls from citizens regarding safety in parks every year.
