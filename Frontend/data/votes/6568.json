Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2020 - 2022 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance No. 0506-2020.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2020-2022) timeframe.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Resource International and the Division of Sewerage and Drainage project staff.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage projects include rehabilitation of existing sewers, repair to existing sewers, construction of new sewers, and construction of green infrastructure.  The majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues.\n \n3.  FUTURE MODIFICATION(S)\nThis is an unplanned modification due to the construction schedule being extended due to a private utility not having their facilities cleared from the project area in time.  Future modifications are not anticipated for this contract.  \n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nResource International’s contract compliance number is CC-004197 and expires 1/31/2024.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated for this expenditure within the Storm Sewer Bond Fund, Fund 6204.  \n \n6.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was established prior to the implementation of the City’s MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the program requirements. Per the Utilization Reporting Form attached to this ordinance, 83.25% of the dollar amount of the work associated with this contract modification is to be performed by vendors certified as WBE.\n \nResource International’s certification was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \nAs part of the contract modification, Resource International has proposed using the following subcontractors to work on the project:\n \nCompany Name                                           City/State                       ODI Certification Status \nColdwater Consulting, Llc.                                                  Columbus                                                                                     WBE\nEMH&T                                                                                                 Columbus                                                                                     WBE\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to execute a modification of the 2020 - 2022 Construction Administration and Inspection Services Agreement with Resource International for the Old Beechwold Area Stormwater System Improvements Project;
