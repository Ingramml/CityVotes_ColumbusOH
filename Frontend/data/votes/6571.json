    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract renewal with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, dba GPD Group, Inc., for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project, CIP #670868-100001, in an amount not to exceed $375,000.00. \n \nThe Division of Power (DOP) has lost several staff members in recent years.  This General Engineering Services contract has been used to supplement DOP design resources to ensure projects stay on track.  Services to be performed include providing designs to connect new customers, reviewing applications for Joint Use, and designing the work required for the Division to complete in conjunction with the installation of solar on the system by NextEra.  There is also design and analysis work that is required relating to the O’Shaughnessy hydro project to ensure that as the new plant comes online it will interconnect properly. This is work that cannot be provided exclusively by City personnel. \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide. \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $375,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract                                                                                    $      750,000.00 (ORD 1369-2022; PO328687)\nCurrent Renewal                                                                                     $      375,000.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                                            $   1,125,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                    $   2,250,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a contract renewal.  GPD Group has been providing these services under contract with planned renewals to add funding for future years.  Rebidding the contract and using another company would be more expensive as the new company would need to spend time learning and redoing work already performed by GPD Group.\n \n1.3. How the cost of renewal was determined:\nPricing was negotiated using current contracted rates after the scope of work was agreed upon.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis is a contract for needed supplemental engineering for the Division of Power’s various CIP projects, studies required by OSHA and PERRP i.e. Arc Flash Hazard Analysis, and possibly to reduce backlog of DOP’s routine engineering that may arise from unexpected work force reduction and/or greater than normal  workload volume.  As such, it will not have any economic impact, but it will include community outreach if it is used for projects that typically solicit input from the community.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nGPD Group’s contract compliance number is CC-006560 and expires 5/20/2023.  GPD Group’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract renewal.  \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  GPD is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the attached Utilization Plan, there is one subcontractor planned to be used on this contract and that subcontractor is certified as an MBE by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this renewal is anticipated to be 15.2%.\n5. FISCAL IMPACT  \nFunds are appropriated and available within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION \nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.  This renewal is needed to provide funding to continue the management of several engineering and construction projects.  The current funding will run out prior to 30-day legislation being enacted causing project management and the associated projects to be suspended awaiting the renewal of funds, thereby delaying the implementation of the needed safety and efficiency improvements these projects would implement, which could result in injuries or power outages.   \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Electricity Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract renewal with GPD Group for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; to expend up to $375,000.00 from the Electricity Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($375,000.00)  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; and \n \nWHEREAS, Contract PO328387 was authorized by Ordinance 1369-2022 for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract renewal with GPD is needed to provide funding for the upgrade work that will be performed this year; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient budget authority for the proper project; and \n \nWHEREAS, a transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for the contract renewal; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities in that it is immediately necessary to execute the contract renewal to prevent a delay in the completion of projects currently in progress that could result in injuries or power outages, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1896-2022 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change \n6303 / 670799-100000 / Voltage Conversion - Circuit 7220 - North High Street, Clintonville (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $296,790.00 / $0.00 / ($296,790.00)\n6303 / 670793-100000 / Dublin Ave. Substation DT-1 Transformer Replacement (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $83,315.00/ $5,104.00 / ($78,211.00)\n \n6303 / 670868-100001 / Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $0.00 / $375,000.00 / $375,000.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That a transfer of funds between projects within the Electricity Bond, Fund 6303, is authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.
