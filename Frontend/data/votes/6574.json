That ordinance and agreement provided a portion of funds needed for the 2022 program year.  The Department of Development put forth Ordinance 3514-2022 to provide funding for the remainder of the 2022 program year.  During the transition from CPH to DOD, the amount of funding that the Faith Mission needed for 2022 was underestimated by $500.00.\n \nThis legislation represents an appropriation for a part of the HOPWA portion of the 2023Annual Action Plan, per Ordinance No. 3353-2022.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 011758 and expires 4/20/2023\n \nFiscal Impact: $500.00 is available from the 2023 HOPWA Grant from HUD (G442203).\n \n \nTitle\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of an amount not to exceed $500.00 of the 2023 Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a Subaward Not-for-Profit Service Contract with LLS Faith Mission, Inc., in an amount not to exceed $500.00, for grant administration services in program year 2022.
