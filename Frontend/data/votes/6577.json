    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Development to modify the contract with AmeriNational Community Services, LLC for loan servicing to add $65,000.00 and to extend the contract for another year.\n \nAmeriNational services loans for the Department of Development provided to small business, home owners, home builders, and multi-family unit builders funded by the city’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME), and/or the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) grants.\n \nCompetitive bids were solicited for this service through Vendor Services in 2011.  The 2011 Mortgage Loan Servicing RFP provided for four, two-year contract periods.  One firm responded and was selected (AmeriNational Community Services, LLC).  \n \nThe original procurement effort and contract, including most renewals, were managed by the Department of Finance and Management.  In 2019, the Department of Development took over ownership of the contract as the loans in the portfolio are held by the Department of Development.  Since taking over the contract, Development has begun the process of reviewing the loan portfolio.  The review of the loan portfolio had been delayed a couple of years because of COVID-19.  With the recent ordinance passed by City Council that authorized the Director of Development to establish a loan forgiveness policy, staff will begin forgiving loans and cleaning up the portfolio.  \n \nOnce cleaned up, an RFP for loan servicing will be issued.  Until such time the portfolio is reviewed and the City has advertised for a new vendor, a contract renewal for this service is needed.  The prices in this contract modification were presented by the vendor and accepted by the Department.  Not all prices were changed, only a portion of them.\n \nPrior contracts/renewals were authorized as follows:\nOrdinance 0139-2012                                          $185,000.00\nOrdinance 0112-2013                                          $120,000.00\nOrdinance 0146-2014                                          $120,000.00 \nOrdinance 0362-2015                                          $118,260.00\nOrdinance 0400-2016                                          $103,753.17\nOrdinance 0995-2017                                          $102,463.00\nOrdinance 0166-2018                                          $  80,000.00\nOrdinance 0218-2019                                          $  80,000.00\nOrdinance 1315-2020                                          $  95,000.00\nOrdinance 0993-2021                                          $  61,000.00\nOrdinance 1161-2022                                          $  65,000.00\n \nThe total compensation for all authorized parts of prior renewals, modifications, and this modification ($65,000.00) results in a total contract amount of $1,195,476.17\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue services without interruption and to prevent loan recipients from not being able to repay loans and the city from not receiving access to loan data and remittances of funds received by the vendor.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nThe total amount to be authorized for this contract modification is $65,000.00.  Funds are available in the Department of Development, Division of Housing 2023 General Fund budget.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE  \nThe vendor number is 007883 and expires 11/10/2023.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify the contract with AmeriNational Community Services, LLC for loan servicing by adding $65,000.00, updating the scope of services as needed, and extending the contract end date; to authorize the expenditure of up to $65,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
