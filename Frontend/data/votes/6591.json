    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to extend and modify an existing contract for the option to obtain Aquiire Marketplace Software, with Coupa Software, Inc.  The software is an electronic catalog administered by the Purchasing Office. It is made available to City staff, allowing them to purchase items from universal term contracts.  Currently, there are more than 475 contracts containing more than 5 million items in the electronic catalog.  The electronic catalog aggregates catalog content from City universal term contracts and externally manages the content from a single site and was the source for more than 42,000 universal term contract catalog purchases orders in 2022.  \n \nThe original contract, PO322542 was established with a waiver of competitive bidding in accordance with and authorized under Ordinance Number No. 0910-2022.  The current agreement was authorized under Ordinance No. 0910-2022, and will expire June 20, 2023.  The current software is set to sunset on December 31, 2024.  In order to extend this agreement to the end of life, the Purchasing Office requests to modify the current agreement to include the option to extend until December 31, 2024.  The original waiver of competitive bidding was requested because the Aquiire Marketplace software had the only known catalog with real time search capability of vendor’s online catalogs. \n \nIn accordance with the contract specifications, the City and Coupa Software, Inc. can renew the contract for an additional one-year term subject to mutual agreement and approval of City Council. This will be the first renewal under the contract. The extended contract expiration date will be June 20, 2024.  With the modification of this contract, the City and Coupa will have the option of extending the contract through December 31, 2024.\n \nCoupa Software, Inc. - CC030001 - Expires April 10, 2025\n \nTotal Estimated Annual Expenditure: $217,744.00, Division of Finance and Management, primary user. \n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Parties listing of the Federal Government and are not listed in the Auditor of States database for Findings for Recovery.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $217,744.00 with Coupa Software, Inc. for the cost of the annual renewal of the Aquiire Marketplace Software contract.
