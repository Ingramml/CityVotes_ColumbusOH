An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget is required to match cash received from the Special Income Tax Fund and also to establish sufficient budget authority for this project.  Funds will need to be appropriated within the Special Income Tax Fund and then transferred to the Streets and Highways Bond Fund where they will also need to be appropriated.\n5.
