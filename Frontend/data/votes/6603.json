    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Columbus Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a contract with Community for New Direction (CND)  in the amount of $429,500.00  to provide violence interruption and crisis response activities that include responding to specific violent confrontations, working to mediate and diffuse conflict tensions, and actively promoting peace building among our youth. Contractor shall maintain a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week schedule to respond to calls regarding youth violence confrontations such as shootings, aggravated assaults, homicides, and other violent incidents.\n \nBackground:  The Contractor shall respond to incidents or conflicts within their assigned zone(s) or may impact their assigned zone(s).  The Contractor shall also provide support services to victims' families and friends. Support services will be provided after making initial contact with victims’ families and friends at the scene of an incident, hospital or at a time and location chosen by the victims’ families and friends.
