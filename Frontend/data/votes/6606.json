    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Prime AE Group, Inc., for the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk Extension project, CIP #650491-100007, in an amount not to exceed $1,065,568.19. \n \nThis will provide engineering services during the extension of the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk along Rickenbacker Parkway and Airbase Road from 3329 Thoroughbred Court to County Road 237. Phase 1 will construct approximately 7,500 feet and the majority of the installation will be a 54-inch diameter sewer constructed by tunneling methods. Phase 2 will extend sanitary sewer service further into the Rickenbacker service area by constructing a new 24\" sanitary subtrunk sewer from the planned terminus of phase 1 easterly along Wright Road and adjacent fields to the eastern service boundary near Walnut Creek. To date the consultant has provided the master planning, detailed design, specifications, contract documents and other reports required for the construction of the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk Extension. \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide. \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,065,568.19\n \nOriginal Contract                                                                 $    2,477,083.44 (ORD 1312-2017; PO072924)\nCurrent Modification                                                 $    1,065,568.19\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                $    3,542,651.63\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bidding of the project would likely result in a higher costs since much of the project’s history would have been be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant.  In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.\n \n1.3. How the cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost estimate for the proposed scope of work was prepared by Prime AE Group, Inc., and reviewed by DOSD.  The total modification includes total labor cost (direct labor multiplied by the hourly cost multiplier).\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \n This project will provide City sanitary sewer service to a quickly developing service area.  Also, it will increase the water quality by eliminating potential ground water pollution by preventing the installation of package treatment systems.  In addition, the project has economic benefits by increasing the sewer revenues, creating additional industrial/commercial development and new jobs.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nPrime AE Group, Inc. contract compliance number is CC-002102 and expires 2/24/2025.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Prime AE Group, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Prime AE Group, Inc. plans to utilize City-certified MBE/WBE firms to perform 1.4% of the dollar amount of the work of this contract renewal, amounting to $15,040.46 of the $1,065,568.19 renewal amount. \nAs part of their proposal Prime AE Group, Inc. has proposed the following four subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nAldea Services, LLC                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                     MAJ\nms consultants, inc.                                                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nASC Group, Inc.                                                                              Columbus, Ohio                                                              WBE\nEagon & Associates, Inc.                                                      Worthington, Ohio                                                        MAJ\n \nPrime AE and the above listed subcontractors were in good standing with the City at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds are appropriated and available within the Sanitary G.O. Fund, Fund 6109, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash between projects within the Sanitary G.O. Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n6. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.  Funds on the original contract are depleting and a lot of engineering services will be needed early in the construction phase that is about to start for submittal reviews and coordination.  Work will need to be stopped on this needed public health improvement if the funds are depleted before the contract modification can be implemented, delaying its implementation \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash within the Sanitary General Obligation Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Prime AE Group for the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk Extension Project; to expend up to $1,065,568.19 from the Sanitary General Obligation Fund to pay for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,065,568.19) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk Extension project; and \n \nWHEREAS, Contract PO072924 to Prime AE Group, Inc., was authorized by Ordinance No. 1312-2017 for the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk Extension project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract modification with Prime AE Group, Inc., is needed to provide funding for the upgrade work that will be performed this year; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification will provide engineering services during the extension of the Intermodal Sanitary Subtrunk along Rickenbacker Parkway and Airbase Road from 3329 Thoroughbred Court to County Road 237.
