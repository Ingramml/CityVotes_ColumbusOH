    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to renew a contract with CBRE Government Services LLC (CBRE) for facility management services at the Franklin County Municipal Court Building. Since 2007, the Department of Finance and Management has contracted for facility management services for the Jerry Hammond Center at 1111 E. Broad Street and the Franklin County Municipal Court Building at 375 S. High Street. Beginning June 1, 2023, facility management services related to the Jerry Hammond Center will no longer be a part of this contract. \n \nCBRE will be responsible for regularly assessing the conditions of the Municipal Court Building and its systems, developing and implementing building operations (including janitorial and security services), performing preventive maintenance, and establishing capital plans necessary to maintain, preserve, and keep the premises in good repair and condition. At the City’s request, CBRE may also act as a liaison and assist in the oversight of the design and build out of building renovations and improvements at the Municipal Court Building. \n \nThe initial term of this contract was awarded pursuant to Ordinance No. 1223-2019 and was for the period June 1, 2019 - May 31, 2020, with four (4) annual renewal options.  The first contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance No. 0873-2020 and was for the period of June 1, 2020 - May 31, 2021.  A contract modification was done to add additional funds in the amount of $270,000.00 pursuant to Ordinance No. 2100-2020.  The second contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance No. 0908-2021 and was for the period of June 1, 2021 - May 31, 2022. The third contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance No. 0653-2022 for the period of June 1, 2022- May 31, 2023. A contract modification was done for additional funds in the amount of $160,000.00, pursuant to Ordinance No. 3171-2022.\n \nThe Department of Finance and Management would like to exercise the fourth (4th) and final contract renewal option for facility management services at 375 S. High St., the Franklin County Municipal Court Building. The contract renewal will be for the period of June 1, 2023 - May 31, 2024. The Jerry Hammond Center at 1111 E. Broad St., will be serviced by the Facilities Management Division beginning, June 1, 2023. The Department of Finance and Management will assess the future facilities management needs of the Municipal Court Building, which may be subject to a future RFP process or potential in-sourcing. \n \nThe cost break-down for facility management services at the Municipal Court Building is as follows: \n \nMunicipal Court Building: $1,633,828.00 (consisting of $1,019,361.00 in building operating expenses plus $614,467.00 in building management fees). \n \nCBRE Government Services, LLC, CC027385 \n \nEmergency action is requested to ensure that the facility management services at the Municipal Court Building can continue without interruption.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $1,633,828.00 from the General Fund with CBRE Government Services LLC for facility management services at the Franklin County Municipal Court Building. In 2022, the Finance and Management Department expended $1,575,245.00 for the Franklin County Municipal Court Building for these services.
