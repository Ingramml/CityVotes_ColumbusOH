    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into contract with the Franklin County Public Defender Commission for providing legal counsel to indigent persons charged with criminal offenses. The Franklin County Public Defender Commission performs all the duties and responsibilities under Section 12 of the City Charter, Chapter 173 of the Columbus City Code and Sections 120.13 and 120.14(e) of the Ohio Revised Code in providing legal counsel to indigent persons charged with criminal offenses. Since 1976, the City has contracted with the Commission to represent in the Franklin County Municipal Court all indigent persons (based on poverty guidelines as determined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services) charged with violations of an ordinance of the City of Columbus. Except for State-charged misdemeanors, the City funds the Municipal Unit, while the Franklin County Commissioners fund the balance.\n \nThis contract is presented with the understanding that the total cost of the 2023 public defender program is budgeted to be $7,152,759.00, of which the Franklin County Commissioners' portion is 58 percent (or $4,148,600.00) and the City's portion is 42 percent (or $3,004,159.00).  The State Public Defender Commission is projected to reimburse 75 percent of these costs and therefore the net cost to the City will be $751,040.00.  This amount is then increased by $255,955.00 from the 2022 expenditure reconciliation, resulting in a net 2023 contract amount of $1,006,995.00.  In the event the actual State-charged misdemeanors differ from the estimate, and/or the State reimburses at a different rate, the City may owe the County or it maybe due reimbursement.
