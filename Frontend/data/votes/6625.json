    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Elevate Northland in an amount up to $500,000.00 in support of the Northland Business Center.  Funding will be advanced to the agency on a predetermined schedule.\n \nElevate Northland is a non-for-profit Community Development Corporation in Columbus that brings together groups working on business development and building community bonds, with a mission to uplift people of diverse backgrounds and to create opportunities. The Elevate Northland Business Center will address the needs of the growing Northland area by providing education opportunities such as business basics, business English, and access to food for local entrepreneurs.\n \nThis grant will support entrepreneurs in the Northland area. Entrepreneurship is an important pathway for Northland residents to build generational wealth, create high-income jobs, and overcome the barriers that many living in the area face. Access to resources can be a struggle, which is where the Business Center bridges the gap. The Center will focus on supporting the outreach of social services agencies, providing professional services and small business startup resources that aid in capacity building. The Center will serve as both a business incubator and as a hub for nonprofits. Outreach and engagement will be marketed in French, Nepali, Somali, English, and Spanish to reach target constituencies throughout Northland.\n \nThe funding will support the Business Center as a physical space, supporting rent and utility costs, maintenance and repair costs, security, insurance, and other needs. The funding may also be used to support the personnel and services associated with the Center’s operations, including the business manager, kitchen supervisor, welcome navigator, and other support staff. Services such as marketing, legal, and accounting supports may also be supported by this grant.\n \nEmergency action is requested to provide immediate support to the progress of the Elevate Northland Business Center in order that operations may commence. Elevate Northland is a relatively new non-profit that does not have the capacity to progress this project quickly with their own limited funds. Until the Business Center space is available, local nonprofits supporting Northland small businesses do not have a place to convene and provide streamlined services, hindering opportunities for stability and growth for families and businesses in that area.\n \nApproval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting February 1, 2023.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number for Elevate Northland is 031977 and contract compliance is pending.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Elevate Northland in support of the Elevate Northland Business Center; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; to authorize reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule; and to declare an emergency.
