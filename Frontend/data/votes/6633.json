    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Environmental Design Group to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - Utility Coordination and Utility Services 2020 project.\nOrdinance 2863-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Environmental Design Group for the Roadway - Utility Coordination and Utility Services 2020 project in an amount of up to $350,000.00.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, continuing, contractual access to additional staff and resources that are necessary to provide expertise for utility coordination with various private overhead and underground utilities including expertise reviewing permits related to signal infrastructure.  Ordinance 2394-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $175,000.00.\n \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary for the continuation of utility coordination and permit services for the City of Columbus. Utility coordination and permit services are a vital part of roadway construction, currently we do not have the staff to keep up with the amount of permits received. The consultant has received training and would be able to continue without additional training so that project reviews are delivered on time. It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work. This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $175,000.00.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $350,000.00                     (PO256303, Ord. 2863-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $175,000.00                     (PO347315, Ord. 2394-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $175,000.00                      (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $700,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Environmental Design Group.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Environmental Design Group is CC003292 and expires August 10, 2023.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $175,000.00 is available within Fund 7766, the Streets and Highways Imp Non Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align spending with the proper project. Funds will need to be appropriated.\n  \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to continue to process invoices within the 30 day payment requirement as contracted with Environmental Design Group.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Imp Non Bond Fund; to appropriate funds within the Streets and Highways Imp Non Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Environmental Design Group in connection with the Roadway - Utility Coordination and Utility Services 2020 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $175,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Imp Non Bond Fund to pay for this modification; and to declare an emergency.
