    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the agreement with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, to allow the City's Division of Power to supply electrical energy for certain highway lighting and signs and to provide routine and preventative maintenance on highway lights. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the agreement with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the provision of electrical energy to operate highway lighting and signs and for the maintenance of highway lighting.  \n \nODOT owns highway lights on Interstate Routes 270, 70, 71, 670 and a portion of State Route 315. Under the existing agreement, the city supplies, and ODOT purchases, electrical energy to operate certain highway lighting and signs, and the Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Division of Power (DOP) provides routine and preventive maintenance for lights located on Interstate Routes 70, 71, 670 and portions of State Route 315. ODOT maintains the lights on Interstate Route 270. Conversion of many of the lights from high pressure sodium (HPS) to light emitting diode (LED) fixtures since the last agreement has resulted in an overall decrease in light fixtures maintained by the City, of which there are approximately 2,631 inside City limits and 236 outside City limits. \n \nThe term of this second renewal will be for two years from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2025.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nODOT will pay DOP a flat rate of $37,176.86 per month for the purchase of electrical energy to operate roadway lights and signs on the State Highway System, as well as preventative maintenance payments of $3.50 per lamp per month for those inside City limits and $5.25 per lamp per month for those outside City limits. These payments will total approximately $11,000 per month, while a survey of DOP work orders for the last few years shows costs ranging from $7,500-$10,000 per month to perform the maintenance.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the agreement with the State of Ohio, Department of Transportation, to allow the City's Division of Power to supply electrical energy for certain highway lighting and signs and to provide routine and preventative maintenance on highway lights. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the State of Ohio, Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) owns highway lights on Interstate Routes 270, 70, 71, 670 and a portion of State Route 315; and\n \nWHEREAS, an existing agreement between the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities (DPU) and ODOT for highway lighting authorizes the DPU, Division of Power (DOP) to supply electrical energy for certain highway lighting and signs and to provide routine and preventive maintenance for lights located on Interstate Routes 70, 71, 670 and portions of State Route 315; and \n \nWHEREAS, ODOT maintains the lights on Interstate Route 270; and\n \nWHEREAS, conversion of many of the lights from high pressure sodium (HPS) to light emitting diode (LED) fixtures since the last agreement has resulted in an overall decrease in light fixtures maintained by the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT and DOP desire to renew the agreement for two years from July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, under the proposed second renewal, ODOT will pay DOP a flat rate of $37,176.86 per month for the purchase of electrical energy to operate roadway lights and signs on the State Highway System and maintenance payments of $3.50 per lamp per month for those inside City limits and $5.25 per lamp per month for those outside City limits; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Power, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation for the supply of electrical energy and provision of preventive maintenance  for certain highway lights and signs; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
