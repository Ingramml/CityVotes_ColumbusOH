    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the Professional Construction Management II (PCM II) Services Agreement with AECOM Technical Services, Inc., in an amount up to $75,000.00.\n \nThis contract provides Professional Construction Management (PCM) services over a multiyear period to support multiple construction projects that began construction within the 2017 through 2020 period, with services extending through the end of the construction durations for each assigned project.  Work performed to date includes design phase and construction phase services for those capital improvement projects such as: program management, constructability reviews, construction cost estimating, project coordination, construction scheduling, and construction administration (CA) and construction inspection (CI) services. \n \nThis modification (#7) provides funding to continue construction phase services for the DRWP UV Disinfection project (CIP #690535-100000) including program management, construction management, field representation/inspection, PLC programming and controls integration services, O&M ready support services, and equipment trouble shooting.  It is currently estimated that the DRWP UV construction will be complete by the 3rd quarter of 2023, but this contract duration may need to be extended based on actual construction durations.\n \nThis is the last planned modification, but another modification might be needed if construction is delayed beyond the current planning horizon.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99-Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $75,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $     618,000.00                     (ORD 0003-2016; PO003180, -3188, -3196, -3199, -3202, -3205, -3208)\nModification 1                     $  1,506,000.00                                          (ORD 3363-2016; PO049895 )\nModification 2                     $  5,069,000.00                                          (ORD 2725-2017; PO098486)\nModification 3                     $  7,576,000.00                                          (ORD 2461-2018; PO152038)                     \nModification 4                     $  3,998,000.00                                          (ORD 2801-2019; PO207271)\nModification 5                     $  2,878,000.00                                          (ORD 1873-2020; PO246829, PO246830, PO246831, PO246832, PO246833)\nModification 6                      $     600,000.00                     (ORD 2155-2021; PO296105 & PO296111)\nModification 7 (current)                     $75,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Mods)                     $22,320,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original RFP and the initial authorizing legislation Ord. 0003-2016 for this project anticipated that the selected PCM team would provide services over a multi-year period to maintain continuity and consistency through the project construction periods and to provide coordination between projects.  The current PCM team is familiar with the details of the multiple construction projects underway.  The process of selecting and contracting a new PCM team to oversee these construction projects would likely impact construction progress and increase construction costs.\n \n1.3. How the cost of the modification was determined:\nThe consultant prepared a cost breakdown exhibit including estimated hours and hourly rates for upcoming work.  This cost breakdown was reviewed and approved by the Project manager for the City Division of Water.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis is a Professional Construction Management project which will facilitate the construction administration and construction inspection services for projects in the Division of Water capital program.  These projects are all related to the drinking water supply and treatment systems.  These projects are incorporated in the capital improvement program for various reasons including meeting regulatory requirements, improving the reliability of the City’s drinking water supply, and enhancing work and public safety.  All of these functions are tied to the economic vitality of the service area.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nAECOM Technical Services contract compliance number is CC-010897 and expires 6/22/24.  AECOM Technical Services certification was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) are not required as there are no Federal or State funds being used for this contract.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  AECOM Technical Services is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  AECOM anticipates performing all of the work on this contract modification without the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 0%. \n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT\nThere are sufficient funds within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to match cash and to align budget authority with the proper project.  It is also necessary to transfer cash and appropriation between projects in Fund 6006 to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the Professional Construction Management II Services agreement with AECOM Technical Services; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $75,000.00 within the Water Bond Fund to pay for the contract modification.  ($75,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Professional Construction Management II Services Project;
