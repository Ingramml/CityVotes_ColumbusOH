    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract renewal with Resource International, Inc. to continue providing Work and Asset Management (WAM) database and system administrative support.\n \nSince 2005, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities (DPU) has been utilizing a Work and Asset Management system (WAM) provided by Synergen/SPL/Oracle to manage and track maintenance, work, assets and materials. All of DPU’s divisions utilize the system, but the Department of Technology (DOT) is responsible for oversight and administration of the system, including centralized Information Technology (IT) functions, hardware and software support, email, security, and system integrations citywide. A project has been initiated to replace our existing Oracle WAM system. It will likely be several years before a new system is implemented so continued use and support is still necessary for our existing system.\n \nThe purpose of this contract is to provide WAM database and system administration support for DPU on an “as-needed” basis. These services will include but are not limited to maintenance and upkeep of both hardware and software as suggested by Department of Public Utilities in collaboration with the Department of Technology and Oracle.\n \nPROCUREMENT:  \n \nThe project was formally advertised (RFQ020377) on the Vendor Services website and Bonfire from November 15, 2021 to December 17, 2021. The city received one (1) response. The proposal was deemed responsive and was fully evaluated by the Evaluation Committee on December 21, 2021.\n \nThe original term of the contract was for a period of one year from the date of execution by the City of Columbus, with yearly renewal options for an additional four (4) years (for a maximum contract length of five (5) years), on a year by year basis, authorized by Ordinance 0743-2022. Any renewals will be contingent on funding availability, mutual agreement between the City and vendor, approval by ordinance of Columbus City Council, and appropriation and certification of funds by the City Auditor. The contract does not automatically renew. \n \nThis Ordinance authorizes the first one-year renewal option, and is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract renewal #1 is $0.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $250,000.00\n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The potential need for additional funds was known at the time of the initial contract, however, only a time extension is needed for this renewal.\n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used: This renewal is part of the terms of the contract as originally bid.\n4.   How was cost determined: n/a\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nResource International, Inc. | D365 Vendor # 004197 | EIN on file | Expires 1/31/2024 | \nResource International, Inc. holds WBE status. \n \nSUBCONTRACTOR:\n \nWoolpert, Inc. | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #001040 | Expires 4/17/2025 | \n \nNeither the Contractor nor Subcontractor are debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNone\n \n$75,888.26 has been spent in 2023\n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n$0.00 was spent in 2021\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to allow continuity of support for DPU’s existing Work and Asset Management system (WAM) while its replacement is in development. The contract lapsed on April 29, 2023, so the emergency is necessary to minimize the amount of time the necessary support services are not covered. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the contract with Resource International, Inc. for Work and Asset Management (WAM) database and system administrative support; and to declare an emergency.
