    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate two federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners Office of Justice Policy and Programs. Grant awards support specialized prosecution and victim advocacy services for survivors of domestic violence. Award dollars fund 1) a portion of salary for two specially trained domestic violence prosecutors, and 2) total compensation for one specially trained anti-stalking victim advocate \n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Domestic Violence & Stalking Prosecution Unit provides best-practice prosecution services for victims of misdemeanor domestic violence and stalking crimes. The unit employs six highly-trained and experienced domestic violence prosecutors, sixteen victim advocates, one stalking investigator, one anti-stalking victim advocate and hosts professional liaisons from Franklin County Children Services and Capital University Law School’s Civil Protection Unit. Services provided by the unit are modeled after the National District Attorneys Association’s National Domestic Violence Prosecution Best Practice Guide and are designed to improve victim engagement; decrease recantation; and increase community and law enforcement collaboration. This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of grant funds and the transfer and appropriation of required cash match. \n \nAward #                                          Award Amount                       Required Match                     Total Project\n \n22-WF-VA2-8758                     $86,975.20                                           $28,991.73                                          $115,966.93\n22-WF-VA2-4600                     $55,202.10                                          $18,400.70                                          $73,602.80\n \n2023 VAWA total                     $142,177.30                                          $47,392.43                                          $189,569.73                     \n \nEmergency Action: \nThese award contracts support direct services to victims of violent crimes from January 1st through December 31st, 2023, yet the fully executed sub award contracts from the County were not returned to the City until April, 2023. Emergency action is requested  to allow the City Attorney to accept the award, appropriate award funds, and transfer and appropriate the required cash match to ensure timely reimbursement for grant supported services provided through the first quarter of 2023.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to accept federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) sub awards from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners' Office of Justice Policy and Programs in the amount of $142,177.30 to support domestic violence and stalking prosecution and victim advocacy services; to authorize the transfer of matching funds in the amount of $47,392.43 from the general fund to the general government grant fund; to authorize the total appropriation of  $189,569.73 in the general government grant fund; and to declare an emergency. ($189,569.73)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Franklin County Board of Commissioners' Office of Justice Policy and Programs has awarded the Columbus City Attorney's Office grant funding in the amount of $142,177.30 to support domestic violence prosecution and stalking victim advocacy services, which funds were awarded to the County from the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA); and\n \nWHEREAS, the term of grant funding is for the period January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, grant acceptance requires the City to provide matching funds in the amount of $47,392.43 and \n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney desires to accept said grant award to fund  a portion of the salary for two specially trained domestic violence prosecutors, and total compensation for one specially trained anti-stalking victim advocate; and\n \nWHEREAS, these award contracts support direct services to victims of violent crimes from January 1st through December 31st, 2023, yet the fully executed sub award contracts from the County were not returned to the City until April, 2023.

First quarter grant costs were covered with general fund dollars budgeted for other expenses. As a result, an emergency exists and it is necessary to immediately authorize the City Attorney to accept the award, appropriate award funds, and transfer and appropriate the required cash match so that the office may accept reimbursement for project expenses incurred and expended from the general funds thereby preserving the public health,\npeace, property, safety and welfare.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 8.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
