The Finance and Management Department would like to exercise the second (2nd) of the four (4) annual contract renewals.\nWinnscapes Contract, FID: 31-1313521, CC# CC005033, expiration date September 17, 2021.                     \n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested so that these landscaping services can continue without delay.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $263,276.64 from the general fund with Winnscapes for mowing and landscape maintenance services.
