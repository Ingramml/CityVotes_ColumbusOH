    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with National Water Services, LLC for the Raymond Golf Course Pump Replacement - Hole 10 Project. The contract amount is $51,965.00, with a contingency of $5,100.00, for a total of $57,065.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nWith approximately 40,000 rounds of golf played annually, Raymond Memorial Golf Course produces the highest number of rounds of all six of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s golf courses. The irrigation and well pump that powers the irrigation system began to decline over the past couple of years. It is currently inoperable and in need of emergency repair to get it in operation again before the peak of the golf season and summer. Irrigation is critical to our golf courses in order to provide the best possible playing surfaces to our guests. Also, the well from which we pull the water has not been inspected for sustainability and, by removing the pump and motor for replacement, this project offers us the opportunity to ensure the well is capable of providing water for the irrigation system moving forward.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 29, 2021, and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 16, 2021.
