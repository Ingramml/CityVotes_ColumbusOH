    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with various organizations in support of summer youth engagement and employment programs.\n \nIn April 2023, the City of Columbus had an open and competitive application process to support funding for nonprofit organizations looking to establish or grow programs focusing on various areas including education, arts and crafts, workforce development, and financial literacy. These areas are designed to provide safe, constructive venues for youth to learn, grow and develop during the summer months.\n \nFunding proposals were then evaluated by an interdepartmental review committee comprised of representatives from the Mayor, the Recreation and Parks Department, Department of Neighborhoods and Columbus City Council. \n \nThe services included in these grant agreements cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that students can benefit from summer employment and engagement opportunities.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, the Reimagine Safety subfund and the citywide transfer line.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with various organizations in support of summer youth engagement and employment programs; to authorize an appropriation and transfer within the general fund; to authorize an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
