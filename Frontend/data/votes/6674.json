    "description": "…BACKGROUND: \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\nOn July 16, 2018, Columbus City Council adopted resolution number 0208X-2018 to create The Commission on Black Girls (The Commission or COBG). The creation of COBG was led by former Councilmember Priscilla R. Tyson. The impetus for creating The Commission was the disparities that Black women experience in several areas including but not limited to: homelessness, eviction, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and the wage gap. To change this trajectory, the intent was to start at earlier stages of development and focus on girls.  Charged with studying the quality of life of Black girls in Columbus, The Commission released a report in July 2020 with 18 recommendation areas that are intended to improve services and systemic issues that impact Black girls. The three main areas of focus in the report include Education, Economics, and Mental & Emotional Health. \nExplanation\nThe Department of Neighborhoods houses youth engagement initiatives including The Commission on Black Girls (COBG) and My Brother’s Keeper (MBK).  Both programs focus on services and support for Black youth, respectively COBG focuses on Black girls and MBK centers is efforts on Boys and Young Men of Color. Additionally, this legislation is important to provide funding for summer programming and internships; because both initiatives prioritize education and employment experiences that not only support youth economically, but also provide safe environments that may deter youth from engaging in behaviors that could negatively impact their futures.  \nDue to the effects of COVID-19, the City of Columbus recognizes many organizations providing summer employment opportunities may not have the capacity to do so in 2023. \n \nThrough the American Rescue Plan, up to $1,262,650.00 is allocated to distribute to qualified Columbus area nonprofit agencies. Sub-award grant agreements will be awarded to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Ohio, Inc., Child Development Council of Franklin County, Columbus Fashion Initiative d/b/a Columbus Fashion Alliance (CFA), Legacy Youth Academy, National African American Male Wellness Agency.  The nonprofit organizations will serve at-risk boys and young men of color and black girls between the ages of 14-24 to help ease the challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Importantly, all expenses must be eligible under the United States Treasury American Rescue Plan guidelines. Expenses must be necessary expenditures incurred due to the public health emergency with respect to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) between March 10, 2021 and December 31, 2024.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that students can benefit from summer employment opportunities.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund passed by Congress on March 10, 2021 and signed into law on March 11, 2021.  \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor’s vendor number are \nAfrican American Male Wellness Walk dba National African American Male Wellness Agency 008384 and is valid 5/16/2022-5/16/2024\nBig Brother’s Big Sisters of Central Ohio, Inc. 023784 and is pending\nChild Development Council of Franklin County 004741 and is pending\nColumbus Fashion Initiative dba Columbus Fashion Alliance 031541 and is valid 8/27/2021- 8/27/2023\nLegacy Youth Sports Academy 032877 and is pending\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer and expenditure of up to $1,262,650.00 within the Department of Neighborhoods; to authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into sub-recipient grant agreements with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Ohio, Inc., Child Development Council of Franklin County, Columbus Fashion Initiative d/b/a Columbus Fashion Alliance (CFA), Legacy Youth Academy, and African American Male Wellness Walk d/b/a National African American Male Wellness Agency in an amount up to $1,262,650.00 to add needed capacity to address COVID-19 specific services for boys and young men of color and black girls; to authorize the payment of expenses starting May 16, 2023; and to declare an emergency.
