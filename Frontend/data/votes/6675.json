    "description": "Background\n \nThis ordinance authorizes and directs the City Auditor to transfer and appropriate $1,747,761.00 from the Department of Finance and Management General Fund 1000 to the Department of Neighborhoods General Fund 1000 and authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a service agreement with various not-for-profit agencies, for the purposes of providing summer youth employment and programming.  \n \nThe services included in these agreements cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n. \nExplanation\nThe Department of Neighborhoods houses youth engagement initiatives including The Commission on Black Girls (COBG) and My Brother’s Keeper (MBK).  Both programs focus on services and support for Black youth, respectively COBG focuses on Black girls and MBK centers is efforts on Boys and Young Men of Color. Additionally, this legislation is important to provide funding for summer programming and internships; because both initiatives prioritize education and employment experiences that not only support youth economically, but also provide safe environments that may deter youth from engaging in behaviors that could negatively impact their futures.  \nAbout COBG & MBK\nOn July 16, 2018, Columbus City Council adopted resolution number 0208X-2018 to create The Commission on Black Girls (The Commission or COBG). The creation of COBG was led by former Councilmember Priscilla R. Tyson. The impetus for creating The Commission was the disparities that Black women experience in several areas including but not limited to: homelessness, eviction, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and the wage gap. To change this trajectory, the intent was to start at earlier stages of development and focus on girls.  Charged with studying the quality of life of Black girls in Columbus, The Commission released a report in July 2020 with 18 recommendation areas that are intended to improve services and systemic issues that impact Black girls. The three main areas of focus in the report include Education, Economics, and Mental & Emotional Health. \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that students can benefit from summer employment and programming opportunities.\nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the transfer within and expenditure of $1,747,761.00 from the General Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s vendor numbers are:\nAlways With Us Charities 018333 and is valid 1/24/2023 - 1/24/2025\nCentral Community House 006068 and is valid 3/22/2022 - 3/22/2024\nCentral Community House 006068 and is valid 3/22/2022 - 3/22/2024\nColumbus Metropolitan Library 022018 and is pending                     \nCommunity of Caring Development Foundation 026987 and is valid 6/14/21-6/14/2023\nCommunity Refugee & Immigration Services 005773 and is valid 10/7/2022-10/7/2024\nGodman Guild Association 006076 and is valid 7/1/2021-7/1/2023\nHeart Of JOB Foundation 041659 and is valid 4/27/2022 - 4/27/2024\nHighland Youth Garden 031348 and is valid                     8/29/2022 - 8/29/2024\nICE Mentors Inc. 042295 and is valid 6/28/2022 - 6/28/2024\nKingdom First                     041516 and is valid 4/12/2022-4/12/2024\nNew Birth Christian Ministries 030578 and is valid 7/15/2021-7/15/2023\nOhio Black Dance Organization 045439 and is valid 5/18/2023-5/18/2025\nours brothers keepers                      and is pending                     \nThe Somali Community Association of Ohio 005537 and is pending\nThink Make Live Youth 028007 and is pending\nYMCA of Central Ohio 006085 and is valid 2/23/2022-2/23/2024\nYWCA Columbus 006086 and is valid 3/3/2022-3/3/2024\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with the following not-for-profit agencies in support of summer youth employment and programs: Always With Us Charities, Central Community House, Columbus Metropolitan Library, Community Development of Caring Foundation, Community Refugee & Immigration Services, Godman Guild Association, Heart of JOB Foundation, Highland Youth Garden, ICE Mentors Inc., Kingdom First, New Birth Christian Ministries, Ohio Black Dance Organization, Ours Brothers Keepers, The Somali Community Association of Ohio, Think Make Live Youth, YMCA of Central Ohio, YWCA Columbus and to authorize the transfer within the general fund; to authorize an expenditure within the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
