& Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nJLD Construction Services and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF).  Funds will need to be appropriated within the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, transferred to the Water Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6011, and then appropriated again in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the WPCLF and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in April, 2023.  \n \nFunds in the amount of $2,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Water System Reserve Fund to the Water
