Several public meetings were conducted to incorporate stakeholder input into the project design.   \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Blueprint Hilltop - Palmetto/Westgate Integrated Solutions Project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 1/4/23 through 2/22/23.  Two bids were received for the project and were opened on 2/22/23.  The following companies submitted bids:\n  \nCompany                                                                   Bid Amount                        Compliance Number   ODI Status\nDanbert, Inc.                                               $7,111,031.96                     CC-004618                           MAJ\nFacemyer Company                                               $7,465,652.81                     CC-005926                           EBE\n \nThe Danbert, Inc. bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $7,111,031.96.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nDanbert’s contract compliance number is CC-004618 and expires 02/09/2024.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Danbert.\n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nAs part of their proposal, Danbert has proposed the following nine subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nCAP-STONE & Associates, Inc.                    Columbus, Ohio                                                       WBE\nPaul Peterson Company                                                                 Columbus, Ohio                                                                    MAJ\nRussell Tree Experts                                                                      Westerville, Ohio                                                                MAJ\nDanbert Electrical Corp                                                       Plain City, Ohio                                                                  MAJ\nGriffin Striping                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                        MAJ\nDecker Construction                                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                                                  MAJ\n4K Landscape                                                                               Dublin, Ohio                                                                       MAJ\nHurts Trucking, LLC                                                           Columbus, Ohio                                                                 MBE\nGarcia Surveyors                                           Columbus, Ohio                                                       MBE\n \nThe certification of Danbert and of the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nDanbert and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF).  Funds will need to be appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, transferred to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, and then appropriated again in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the WPCLF and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in May, 2023.  \n \nFunds in the amount of $2,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget;
