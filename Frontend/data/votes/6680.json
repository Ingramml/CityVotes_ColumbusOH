    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with The Righter Co., Inc., for the Compost Facility Odor Control Improvements Phase 1, CIP #650375-100002, in an amount up to $10,996,080.00, and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $ 10,998,080.00.\n \nThis project provides for: replacing the compost blowers, one bio-filter fan, two leachate pumps, locker rooms renovations, improvements to the electrical system, and minor improvements to the composting process.  \n \nORD 3120-2022 authorized the Director of Public Utilities to apply for and execute a loan agreement with the Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) in an amount up to $7,000,000.00 for the construction of this project.  The construction bids came in higher than estimated, so it is necessary to also request City Council's approval to accept a loan for the construction of this project in an amount up to $12,000,000.00.\nThe Community Planning Area is “59 - Southwest”.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will provide improvements and repairs to the Compost Facility's process, odor control, and electrical systems. This will include repair or replacement of piping, blower, and electrical systems to restore reliability from existing equipment. Due to age, several systems have decreased reliability and require repair and replacement to ensure consistent operational capacity.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Compost Facility Odor Control Improvements Phase 1 project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 11/08/22 through 01/18/23.  One bid was received for the project and was opened on 01/18/23.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                                                  Bid Amount                                            Compliance Number          ODI Status\nThe Righter Co., Inc.                                             $10,996,080.00                                                               CC-004433                                                 MAJ\n \nThe Righter Co., Inc. bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $ 10,996,080.00.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe Righter Co., Inc. contract compliance number is CC-004433 and expires 11/22/23.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against The Righter Co., Inc. \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 25% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 25% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nAs part of their proposal, The Righter Co., Inc. has proposed the following six subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                      City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nRoberts Service Group, Inc.                                             Columbus, Ohio                                                               WBE\nCapital City Mechanical                                                                  Grove City, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nHolloway, Henderson & Martin, LLC                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                    WBE\nThe Ardit Company                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                 WBE\nOK Interiors Corp                                                                  Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nK. Davis, Inc.                                                                                       Gibsonburg, Ohio                                                                EBE\n \nThe certification of the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nComplete General Construction and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThe bid for this project exceeded the engineer’s estimate and the award took longer than usual as each line of the bid needed more analysis. The vendor’s bid was deemed responsive but the 180 day hold on the vendor’s pricing is near ending and an emergency designation is requested so the contract can be awarded before the price is increased. \n \n8.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is expected to be financed with a loan from the Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund.  Funds will need to be appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, transferred to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, and then appropriated again in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in May, 2023.  \n \nFunds in the amount of $2,000.00 are available and appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget;
