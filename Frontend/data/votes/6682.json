    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract with Brown and Caldwell for professional design services for the SWWTP Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project, CIP #650353-100007, in an amount up to $21,224,775.42. \n \nThis project is for preliminary and detailed design services and will provide a preliminary design report and design for the installation of Digesters 8 and 9, a Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) and high strength organic waste (HSW) receiving station, a combined heat and power (cogeneration) facility to utilize the digester gas, new waste gas burners, and relocation of the gravity bypass at the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant. \n \nA future modification will be requested for Step 3 - Services during Construction.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” \nTIMELINE:  The total term of the Step 1 Preliminary Design and Step 2: Detailed Design Services contract will be for twenty one (21) months after notice to proceed is given. Notice to proceed is expected to be in May of 2023 with bidding completed in August of 2024. Once a Contractor has been selected, a contract modification will be requested for Step 3: Services during Construction and is currently anticipated to be for five years, ending in September of 2029.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The negotiated award amount for engineering services is $21,224,775.42 including a 5% contingency and if authorized tasks that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  One contract modification is anticipated for Step 3 - Services during Construction.\n                     \n                     Original Contract                                               $21,224,775.42\n                     Future Anticipated Needs                           $15,792,000.00\n        CONTRACT TOTAL                                      $37,016,775.42\n \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project was created by combining the SWWTP Cogeneration, SWWTP Digester Expansion, Phase III project, and SWWTP FOG/HSW Receiving Station projects. These projects were combined and accelerated in order to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) rebate program. Under the current guidance provided from the IRS, this project is eligible for up to 50% rebate on the total construction cost. This rebate will save the City of Columbus up to $70,000,000 on the construction of facilities that were already in the capital budget. \n \nIn addition to IRA rebates, this project is eligible for additional funding and grants due to greenhouse gas reductions, electrical usage reduction, and FOG/HSW diversion from landfills.\n \nThe creation of a FOG/HSW program will generate a revenue stream from the tipping fees associated with the acceptance of the material. There will also be a reduction in outside electricity demands from the biogas powered generators that will be installed.\n \nFrom an environmental perspective, this project will reduce SWWTP’s greenhouse gas footprint by capturing methane from the digesters. The HSW diversion program will divert food and other organic waste from the SWACO landfill to SWWTP for biogas and power production.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from 2/14/2023 through 3/17/23.   One proposal was received:\n \n     Name                                          C.C. No.            Exp. Date________City/State                Status                     \nBrown and Caldwell, LLC               CC-010815          10/12/23                             Columbus, OH                     MAJ     \n \nThe proposal was deemed responsive.  The evaluation committee reviewed the proposal and recommended the contract for the SWWTP Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project be awarded to Brown and Caldwell.\n \nBrown and Caldwell’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract award.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis project is being undertaken to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act rebate being offered to energy communities and municipalities. Under the available IRS guidance, the City of Columbus will be eligible for a rebate up to 50% of the construction cost. According to our current construction cost estimate, this project would be eligible for approximately $67.5 million in rebates. However, to obtain this rebate, this project must meet what the IRS is calling the “Beginning of Construction” deadline. This deadline is currently set to December 31, 2024. This means that this project must either have 5% of the construction cost paid to the Contractor (5% Safe Harbor) or must have substantial construction begin and continue through the completion of the project (Substantial Work Test). The rebate amount will be reduced if the deadline is missed. Emergency legislation is being requested to aid in meeting these deadlines. Design Services will take approximately 14 months and would allow enough time to procure a contractor and meet the December 31, 2024 deadline.\n \n5.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nBrown and Caldwell’s contract compliance number is CC-010815 and expires 10/12/23.  Searches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Brown and Caldwell. \n \n6.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 13.95% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Brown and Caldwell has proposed the following eight subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nDLZ                                                                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                     MBE\nJacobs Engineering Group                                                 Columbus, Ohio                                                                                      MAJ\nBlack and Veatch                                                                       Columbus, Ohio                                                                                  MAJ\nArcadis                                                                                                 Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                     MBE\nRegency Construction                                                                 Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nResource International                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                                                                     WBE\nT&M Associates                                                                Dublin, Ohio                                                                             MAJ\n \nThe certification of the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0997-2023, passed by Council on 4/24/23.  This was passed as 30-day legislation so this ordinance is contingent upon Ordinance 0997-2023 becoming effective 5/24/23.\n \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the OWDA Loan Fund, Fund 6111 in the amount of $ 21,224,775.42 is needed to fund construction for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the OWDA to reimburse the Sanitary Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in June, 2023.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund. An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund to the Ohio Water Development Authority Loan Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Brown and Caldwell, for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility project; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $21,224,775.42 from the Ohio Water Development Authority Loan Fund for the contract; and to declare an emergency.
