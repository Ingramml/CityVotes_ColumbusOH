    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to issue purchase orders to Horton Emergency Vehicles, Stryker Sales Corporation, and Motorola Solutions Inc. for the purchase of Fire and EMS emergency response vehicles and related equipment.  \nThe Division of Fire has an immediate need to purchase two (2) EMS transport vehicles (medics) from Horton Emergency Vehicles to replace medics that have been removed from service.  The Division of Fire also has an immediate need to replace Stryker EMS equipment, including LUCAS compression devices and Power Load Cots/Loaders to equip the new medics.  In addition to this EMS apparatus and equipment, the Division of Fire needs to purchase radio communications equipment from Motorola Solutions Inc. to replace aging equipment used in emergency response.  \nBID INFORMATION:  Horton Emergency Vehicles ~ FID #352018529  /  Vendor 007091  ~  The Division of Fire requests to purchase two (2) EMS transport vehicles (medics) in the amount of $717,216.00.  Competitive bidding is being waived for Horton Emergency Vehicles for the purchase of these EMS medics.  The Division of Fire has standardized it's custom EMS response apparatus fleet.  This custom apparatus from Horton Emergency Vehicles has been the Fire Division's standardized equipment for several years.  In an effort to purchase apparatus that are best for the operations given the quality, durability and customizability Horton offers, as well as the cost effective approach that has resulted from negotiating directly with the manufacturer during the build process.  By dealing directly with the manufacturer during the specification and price negotiation processes, the Division of Fire is able to control costs to remain within budgeted funding and manage lead times.  The subsequent contracts established by Fleet Management with Horton Emergency Vehicles has also simplified the managing of parts/service after purchase.\nStryker Sales Corporation ~ FID #382902424 / Vendor 030281 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase of fifteen (15) Stryker LUCAS compression devices to replace current equipment that is no longer under warranty.  The Division of Fire also requests the purchase of two (2) Stryker Ambulance Power Cots/Loaders for use in the aforementioned medics in the total amount of $444,206.22.  In the past these cots have been included in the specifications along with other EMS equipment that comes on the EMS vehicles.  However, buying directly from the manufacturer will result in a significant savings to the City.  A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 329 is necessary for this purchase as the Stryker LUCAS compression devices and Power Cot/Loaders are the standardized ambulance cot deployed by the Division of Fire, making it  impractical to bid given Stryker is the sole distributor for this proprietary equipment.\nMotorola Solutions Inc. ~ FID #361115800 / Vendor #007169 ~ The Division of Fire requests the purchase of thirty (30) radios and related communications equipment for the current apparatus fleet in the amount of $184,111.13.  The City of Columbus Purchasing Office has a Universal Term Contract for these purchases via PA005455 exp. 06/30/2023.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Current build times are two (2) years for the EMS transport vehicles (medics) being purchased in this ordinance.  Emergency action is requested to insure funds are encumbered immediately to allow for the production of these custom apparatus to commence upon passage of this ordinance and confirmation of the subsequent purchase orders.  Emergency action is requested for the EMS and radio communications equipment to avoid delays in purchasing due to potential supply chain shortages.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  This project is budgeted for in the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget.  This ordinance is contingent upon the deposit of the 2023 bond sale proceeds.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Department of Public Safety, to enter into contracts with and issue purchase orders to Horton Emergency Vehicles for the purchase of two (2) EMS transport vehicles in the amount of $717,216.00, Stryker Sales Corporation for the purchase of EMS LUCAS compression devices and Power Cots and Loaders in the amount of $444,206.22, and Motorola Solutions Inc. for radio communications equipment in the amount of $184,111.13; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $1,345,533.35 from the Safety General Obligation Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
