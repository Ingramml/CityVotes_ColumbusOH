    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:    This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Safety to enter into a contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. for EMS billing, collection, and reporting services effective April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024.  The Public Safety Department entered into a contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. via ordinance 3233-2018 passed December 6, 2018.  The purpose of the contract is for EMS billing, collection, patient care reporting, hardware devices, accompanying extra equipment, third party auditing, training, and onsite personnel as needed for the Division of Fire's Third Party EMS Reimbursement Program.  The reimbursement program originated via Ordinance #1184-02, passed July 22, 2002.  The prior contract for these services as authorized by previous ordinances expired March 31, 2023.  Therefore it is necessary to enter into a new one-year contract with Change Healthcare for the period of April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024 to ensure that EMS billing, collection, and reporting services are continued without interruption.\n \nPublic Safety contracts the services of Change Healthcare for the billing, collection, and reporting of those who are transported to hospitals by EMS personnel for emergency medical care.  These billing, collection, and reporting services have generated a multitude of patient care information used by the Fire Division to better prepare EMS response protocols and, in turn, respond to citizens in a more effective manner.  The division also generates reports for various fire organizations that are catalogued nationwide.  Revenue generated since inception of the program in 2002 amounted to over $270 million at the end of December 2022 and is deposited in the city's General Fund.    \n \nThis ordinance also repeals Ordinances 0118-2023 and 0790-2023, passed on February 6, 2023 and April 3, 2023, respectively.\n \nContract Compliance:   Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. FID 23-2939847 / vendor #025233\n \nBid Waiver Justification:                     The Division of Fire has successfully implemented specialized EMS billing services in previously contracting with Change Healthcare and does not seek an alternative solution at this time; Change Healthcare has proven a qualified contractor to manage this service.\n \nEmergency Designation:                     The prior contract for these services as authorized by previous ordinances expired March 31, 2023, therefore emergency action is necessary to enter into a new one-year contract with Change Healthcare to ensure that EMS billing, collection, and reporting services are continued with minimal disruption and ensure the continued receipt of EMS billing revenues, collection of related data, and reporting of statistical information.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation seeks to enter into a new one-year contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. for billing and collection services and authorize the expenditure of $1,500,000.00 for billing services, which is budgeted in the Division of Fire's 2023 General Fund operating budget.  Approximately $1,400,000.00 was expended in 2022 and $1,250,000.00 in 2021 for these services.\nTitle\nTo repeal Ordinances 0118-2023 and 0790-2023, to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a new contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. for EMS billing, collection, and reporting services for the Division of Fire; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $1,500,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($1,500,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to repeal Ordinances 0118-2023 and 0790-2023 passed February 6, 2023 and April 3, 2023, respectively to allow for this legislation to replace it, and \n \nWHEREAS, the City contracts for EMS billing, collection, and reporting services, as initiated via Ordinance #1184-02, passed July 22, 2002; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the City entered into a contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. via Ordinance 3233-2018 passed December 6, 2018, to continue an agreement to provide EMS billing services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to enter into a new one-year contract with Change Healthcare for the period of April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2024 to ensure that EMS billing, collection, and reporting services are continued with minimal disruption and ensure the continued receipt of EMS billing revenues, collection of data, and reporting of statistical information; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. to continue these EMS billing, collection and reporting services; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 to enter into this contract given the specialized and unique nature of the services provided; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Fire, Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc., so that EMS billing, collection, and reporting services can continue without interruption for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
