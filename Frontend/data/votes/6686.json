    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance authorizes the transfer of $550,000.00 from the Department of Finance’s citywide transfer fund to the Department of Public Safety for the purposes of entering into a service agreement with Street Smart Rentals, LLC to continue the rental of temporary lights and security camera systems to monitor city parks.     \n \nDue to incidents of violence in parks, the City of Columbus entered into an agreement last year with Street Smart Rental Services to install temporary and portable lights and camera systems in City parks that are of concern to the community and the Division of Police. This ordinance is to enter into a second year of continued monitoring of selected Columbus parks.  These lights and camera systems will continue to enhance the Police’s ability to actively monitor the parks. If a violent incident occurs in one of the identified locations, these cameras will assist in the apprehension of suspects. \n \nTwenty-five (25) locations for initial deployment were identified by the Division of Police and Recreation and Parks Department utilizing the latest crime data, as well as intelligence from patrol officers and neighborhood residents. These systems are mobile, allowing the Division to relocate them to the area of greatest need. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the transfer of $550,000.00 from the Department of Finance’s Citywide Transfer Fund to the Department of Public Safety for a temporary lights and security camera system rental contract. Last year's contract was for $500,000.00.\n \nBID INFORMATION: The Department of Public Safety is requesting a Bid Waiver on this contract to continue with the vendor that has infrastructure in place at our city parks to continue monitoring without interruption.  Street Smart Rental was awarded the contract last year as the results of an informal evaluation determined that Street Smart Rentals, LLC was the only provider capable of deploying this equipment to meet the time constraints and volume needed. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is requested in order not to interrupt this safety measure and keep the deployed temporary lights and security camera systems monitoring city parks. Funds legislated last year will be depleted after the month of May 2023's payment.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into contract with Street Smart Rentals, LLC in order to rent temporary lights and security camera systems for deployment in city parks; to authorize the transfer of $550,000.00 within the General Fund, from the Department of Finance's City-wide account to the Department of Public Safety; to authorize the expenditure of $550,000.00 from the General Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency. ($550,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the transfer of $550,000.00 within the General Fund, from the Department of Finance to the Department of Public Safety; and\n \nWHEREAS, this transfer is necessary in order to properly align appropriation with projected expenditure; and\n \nWHEREAS,  it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into contract with Street Smart Rentals, LLC in order to rent temporary lights and security camera systems for deployment in city parks; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety has determined that it is in the City’s best interest to waive the competitive bidding procedures of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 and continue with the vendor who already has infrastructure in place at our city parks and can continue crime monitoring without interruption; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $550,000.00 from the General Fund 1000-100010; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into contract with Smart Street Rentals, LLC for the rental of temporary lights and security camera systems to ensure the safety of Columbus residents and continue the rentals after this month, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
