    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the City Attorney to enter into two contracts with Lindsay Automotive, Inc. and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care for the purpose of supporting and expanding the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention pilot.  \n \nIn 2021, Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein partnered with the Columbus Division of Police, the Franklin County Board of Commissioners, Columbus State Community College and local auto repair shops to pilot Project Taillight--an innovative public safety and crime prevention program.\n \nProject Taillight aims to improve community safety and trust by connecting low-income residents with free headlight, taillight, brake light, license plate light and/or turn signal repairs-- keeping everyone safer on the roads and avoiding fees for citations/tickets. Participants also receive free vehicle inspections and fluid top off services. \n \nCommunity residents from households with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty level are eligible for free repairs. Columbus Police Community Liaison Officers, the Department of Neighborhoods and non-profit partners spread the word about the program then refer interested residents to the City Attorney’s Community Outreach team. The City Attorney Outreach team screens for eligibility then connects eligible drivers to Project Taillight auto partners for repair services. \n \nDuring the first portion of this pilot, it became apparent during the vehicle inspections that many of the vehicles brought in for repairs had issues affecting them other than just safety lights, and that there would be difficulty for residents to afford these additional repairs.  Columbus City Council is partnering with the City Attorney’s office to make funds available to assist with these repairs, to keep these automobiles operational and allow residents to maintain their transportation.  The City Attorney will enter into additional contracts with existing partners to allow for these repairs.\n \nThe City Attorney’s office is requesting a waiver of competitive bidding, as Lindsay Automotive, Inc. and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care are existing vendors for the Project Taillight pilot, are already familiar with the parameters of the programming, and would allow for an expeditious expansion of the pilot.  \n \nColumbus City Council is supporting these efforts with $175,000.00 in funding from the Reimagine Safety subfund.  \n \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to immediately provide the funds necessary to continue and expand the Project Taillight pilot and provide residents with needed repairs to their vehicles.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Total appropriation is $175,000.00 and is available within the Reimagine Safety subfund.    \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to enter into two contracts with Lindsay Automotive, Inc and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care for the purpose of supporting and expanding the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention pilot; to authorize an appropriation of $175,000.00 within the Reimagine Safety subfund; to authorize a transfer, appropriation, and expenditure within the Public Safety Initiative subfund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency. ($175,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office implemented the innovative Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention pilot giving low-income residents access to free vehicle safety light repair services; and\n \nWHEREAS, these repair services keep drivers, passengers and pedestrians safer on the roads and prevent low-income residents from receiving tickets for safety code violations; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council and the City Attorney are proposing an expansion of the pilot, which will allow additional repairs on vehicles that are identified in the initial review of safety lights; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney works with local, accredited, vetted repair shops to ensure ready access to quality repairs for program participants; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney have engaged both Lindsay Automotive, Inc. and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care for repair services and these vendors have the necessary experience and expertise to provide said service; and\n \nWHEREAS, there is funding available in the Reimagine Safety subfund fund 1000-100019 for this purpose; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Attorney’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Attorney to enter into contracts with Lindsay Automotive, Inc and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care, ensuring the expansion of Project Taillight services can commence and run through the agreed upon project period; all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;  NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1:  That the City Attorney is hereby authorized to enter into contracts with Lindsay Automotive, Inc. and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care for the purpose of supporting and expanding the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention pilot.\n \nSECTION 2.
