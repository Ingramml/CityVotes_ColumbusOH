    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance approves the acceptance of certain territory (AN22-022) by the city of Columbus and authorizes its transfer from Blendon Township to Montgomery Township per an annexation agreement between the City and the Township. The Ohio Revised Code stipulates that to be effective, City acceptance must take place a minimum of 60 days from the receipt by the City Clerk of the approval notice from the county. If City Council does not accept the ordinance within 120 days of its first consideration, the annexation will be considered rejected. This petition was filed with Franklin County on February 21, 2023. Franklin County approved the annexation on March 7, 2023 and the City Clerk received notice on March 28, 2023. No service ordinance was required because this annexation was filed as a Type 1 application as defined by the ORC. Although not required, a service statement reflecting the City’s ability to provide services for this site upon annexation is attached.\nThe use of a Type 1 annexation application is stipulated in the annexation agreement between the City and Blendon Township. The annexation agreement also requires that territory annexed to the City of Columbus from Blendon Township be transferred to Montgomery Township. This ordinance authorizes the submission of a petition to the Board of County Commissioners of Franklin County, Ohio, requesting that the boundary lines of Montgomery Township be changed to make them identical with the corporate limits of the City of Columbus for this annexation. The petition will be filed in accordance with Section 503.07 of the Ohio Revised Code.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo accept the application (AN22-022) of Jon-David Charlton and Jodi M. Charlton et.al. for the annexation of certain territory containing 32.99± acres in Blendon Township.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, a petition for the annexation of certain territory in Blendon Township was filed on behalf of Jon-David Charlton and Jodi M. Charlton et.al. on February 21, 2023; and\nWHEREAS, the petition was considered and approved by the Franklin County Board of Commissioners at a hearing on March 7, 2023; and\nWHEREAS, on March 28, 2023, the City Clerk received from Franklin County a certified copy of the resolution addressing the petition; and\nWHEREAS, sixty days have now elapsed since receipt of the resolution in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the city of Columbus to accept the annexation of the territory addressed by the petition; and,\nWHEREAS, the annexation agreement between Blendon Township and the City of Columbus requires the City to transfer territory annexed from Blendon Township to the city of Columbus and to conform the boundaries of Montgomery Township to make them identical with the corporate limits of the city; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
