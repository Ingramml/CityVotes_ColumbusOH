    "description": "Explanation\n                      \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Empowering Latinas Leadership Academy (ELLA), a corporation for non-profit, in support of their next cycle of professional development programming for Latinas in Columbus.\n \nEmpowering Latinas Leadership Academy (ELLA) seeks to provide Latinas with the knowledge, skills, and resources they need to succeed in their chosen careers and become leaders in their fields. Through this dual focus, ELLA aims to increase the representation of Latinas on boards, promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in leadership roles, and promote Latinas' voices to be included in Columbus Ohio's crucial decision-making. By offering training, mentorship, and networking opportunities, ELLA seeks to empower Latinas to advance professionally, break down barriers, and achieve their full potential as leaders who can positively impact their communities and society as a whole.\nThe grant will support ELLA’s five-month professional development program that brings together Latinas in a variety of career stages and career fields for a unique experience, combining professional mentorship with culturally relevant workshops and civic engagement. The program creates a culturally relevant and brave space for our Latinas in the Columbus community to grow professionally and personally. The ultimate goal is to empower ELLA’s growing Latina network to advocate and be good community stewards in their professional space.\nELLA is not limited to one career state, industry, or field of work, but rather focuses on breaking down the barriers that all Latinas face in professional development. The program supports a cycle of 20 mentees and mentors each year. In addition to the 20 mentees and mentors, ELLA partners with additional community organizations and small businesses for each session. \nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested so that reimbursement to Empowering Latinas Leadership Academy may begin as soon as possible, as their programming began in mid-May, and support is needed immediately to continue to book speakers and spaces for the mentoring events.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Empowering Latinas Leadership Academy to support their next cycle of professional development programming for Latinas in Columbus; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
