    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department asking that the City extinguish the right-of-way and transfer the asset of an approximate 0.252 acre portion of right-of-way from the Department of Public Service to the Recreation and Parks Department to be combined with parcel 010-071202.  The right-of-way area is located adjacent to the Whetstone Park area; and is located at the south-west corner of the Olentangy/Ceramic intersection.  \n \nExtinguishing the right-of-way and transferring the asset will facilitate improvements and enhancements to city-owned property; this right-of-way is within Park boundaries and should not exist as City right-of-way but should be under the control of the Recreation and Parks Department.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by extinguishing this right-of-way and transferring the asset among City Departments.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on February 16, 2023.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the asset at no cost to them, as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThere is no cost to the City to transfer the right of way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo extinguish a 0.252 acre portion of the above mentioned right-of-way and transfer control of the property to the Recreation and Parks Department.
