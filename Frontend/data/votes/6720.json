    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with All Nations Worship Assembly, a non profit entity, for the support of their Tomorrows Leader's Youth Intervention Program.\n \nIn April 2023, the City of Columbus had an open and competitive application process to support funding for nonprofit organizations looking to establish or grow programs focusing on various areas including education, arts and crafts, workforce development, and financial literacy. These areas are designed to provide safe, constructive venues for youth to learn, grow and develop during the summer months.\n \nFunding proposals were then evaluated by an interdepartmental review committee comprised of representatives from the Mayor, the Recreation and Parks Department, Department of Neighborhoods and Columbus City Council. \n \nThe services included in these contracts cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with All Nations Worship Assembly for the support of the Tomorrow Leader’s Youth Intervention Program; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
