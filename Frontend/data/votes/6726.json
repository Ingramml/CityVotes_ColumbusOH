    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten. Kindergarten readiness is a multidimensional construct reflecting young children’s preparedness for instruction in areas related to both academic and social-emotional skills. Children who arrive to kindergarten with limited readiness in one or more of these areas face challenges in the transition into the kindergarten setting, and are susceptible to academic achievement over time.\n \nParticipation in quality early childhood education can provide an important mechanism for developing children’s school readiness; likewise, certain intentional parenting practices, such as shared book-reading and numeracy discussions, also can support school readiness. However, not all children have access to quality early learning programs and/or intentional parenting practices.\n \nBecause of this, the Mayor’s Office of Education is requesting the authority to partner with Columbus Early Learning Centers (CELC) on the Summer Success Program at the Hilltop Early learning Center (SSHELC), a four-week intensive summer readiness ‘camp’ for children without prior Early Childhood Education experience and those who may not have sufficient supports at home for developing key readiness skills.  In addition, funding will be provided through this ordinance for important teacher and student recruitment activities for the 2023-2024 school year. Summer readiness camp to begin June 1, 2023. \n \nTherefore, the Office of Education requests permission to contract with CELC to provide this crucial work.\n \nThis contract is being awarded pursuant to City Code Chapter 329, which allows for the City to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts.  This organization was selected due to their existing contract with the City to serve as the Master Operator of the Hilltop Early Learning Center and their success in providing high quality early learning experiences.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract ($345,000.00) is available within the 2023 Office of Education General Fund budget.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is requested to ensure that programming can begin June 1, 2023.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract with Columbus Early Learning Centers to plan and implement the 2023 Summer Success Program at the Hilltop early Learning Center, a four-week intensive summer readiness ‘camp’ for children without prior early childhood education experience needed for the achievement of the Mayor’s goal that every child is ready for kindergarten; to authorize the expenditure of $345,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
