    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for professional services and construction services for the SWWTP VFD & Harmonic Filter Upgrades project, CIP #650346-100002, in an amount up to $443,624.94. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities’ (DPU) Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD) has identified numerous Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) and Harmonic Filters at several Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) processes that are nearing the end of their useful service life and are becoming increasingly difficult to repair and maintain. These processes include the fine screens, the Return Activated Sludge (RAS) pumps, the thickening centrifuges, and the skimmings’ concentrators. This project will provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate, replace, configure, and program the VFDs and harmonic filters, provide new controls that may be necessary to integrate the new equipment into the existing systems, and provide any other ancillary work to provide a fully functioning system. This work will also include recommendations for the standardization of equipment that can be used in the DOSD Guide Specifications and programming of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The equipment specified will vary based on site conditions, building use, building permit requirements, and ease of maintenance issues. Consideration shall be given to increasing ease of maintenance, development of standardized operating systems, and specifying control systems access software. This work is part of the City’s continuing effort to upgrade its treatment facilities, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety.\n \nThis agreement will provide engineering services necessary for the preliminary design, detailed design, services for construction procurement, and engineering services during construction. The original agreement will be for preliminary design only. Future modifications of this contract are planned to provide funding for the remaining services. This project may be funded via the WPCLF program.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide”. \nTIMELINE:  Arcadis will begin work after the Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given upon execution of their Professional Engineering Services Agreement which is anticipated to be during the summer of 2023. The engineering agreement will provide Step 1, Preliminary Design Services. The completion of Preliminary Design and approval of the PDR is currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2023. A modification request for Detailed Design is currently scheduled for late 2023 so that the modification can be finalized and Detailed Design can begin upon completion of Preliminary Design in the first quarter of 2024. Detailed Design will continue until advertisement for bids, then bidding services will commence. It is anticipated that plans and specs will be finalized and ready for advertisement during the second quarter of 2024, bids will be received in the third quarter of 2024, and Notice to Proceed of the construction contract will be in the fall of 2024. The anticipated end of the construction contract is early 2026. The Professional Engineering Services contract will continue beyond completion of construction to provide record drawings of the constructed facilities and to provide assistance during the warranty period. The engineering agreement is anticipated to be closed in 2027.\n \nThe total term of the engineering agreement is estimated to be 3.5 years. The estimated ending month and year of the agreement is January, 2027.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The original engineering agreement amount is $443,624.94. Two additional contract renewals are anticipated at this time.\n                     \n                     Original Engineering Agreement (for Preliminary Design)                                                                             $443,624.94\n                     Future Modification for Detailed Design and Bidding Service                                                   $822,000.00 \n                     Future Modification for Engineering Services during Construction                                  $822,000.00\n                       CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                                           $2,087,624.94\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe performance of this project’s activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and replace VFDs and Harmonic Filters at SWWTP is needed to continue the City’s effort to upgrade its treatment facilities, provide efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations, and enhance personnel safety. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the City’s wastewater treatment system and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 2/10/23.   Two proposals were received:\n \nName                                               C.C.
