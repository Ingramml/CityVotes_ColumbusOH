    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (Mod #1) the professional engineering services agreement with HNTB Ohio, Inc. for the SMART Lighting project (CIP 670878-100000), in an amount up to $622,886.47, for the Division of Power. This is for the design of Phase 1 for Smart Lighting.  The Phase 1 project will be in the Hilltop neighborhood.  The original contract performed the design of the Pilot project.  Additional services to be provided include updating some current specifications that are required as the Smart Lighting project advances. \nPlanning Area is 53 (Greater Hilltop).\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $622,886.47\n                     Original Contract (PO152108)                                          $1,081,488.05\n                     Modification #1 (current)                                          $   622,886.47\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                                               $1,704,374.52\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThis is a planned contract modification and the additional services were identified in the original contract ordinance.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant. In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost estimate for the proposed scope of work was prepared by HNTB Ohio, Inc. and reviewed by the Division of Power.  \n \n2.0 PROJECT TIMELINE: The intent is this design will be completed in the fall of 2021 so the construction of this phase can begin early in 2022.\n3.0 EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time. \n \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER: 43-1628397 / MAJ/ Exp. 4/1/22/ Vendor No. 008025  \n \n5. ECONOMIC IMPACT: The addition of lighting within the project area would provide both a sense of safety and security to the residents.  This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources, such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \n6. FISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $622,886.47 from the Electricity G.O. Bond Fund 6303; a transfer within the Electricity G.O. Bond Fund 6303 of up to $271,330.19, and an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase an engineering agreement with HNTB Ohio, Inc., for professional engineering services relating to the SMART Street Lighting Project; to authorize a transfer of up to $271,330.19 and an expenditure of up to $622,886.47 from the Electricity G.O.
