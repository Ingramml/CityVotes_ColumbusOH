    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the Make -A - Day Foundation in support of their Community Appreciation & Opportunity Team (CAOT) outreach program. \n \nThe Make-A-Day Foundation is launching a new mobile Community Appreciation & Opportunity Team (CAOT) outreach program. By taking their outreach on the road, Make-A-Day will meet people where they live and where they are in life’s journey. \n \nMake-A-Day’s CAOT outreach program will provide opportunities for homeless guests to build personal relationships with other community members. By connecting guests to community volunteers, providing made-to-order meals from gourmet food trucks, and offering professional haircuts, shampoos, styling and shaves, Make-A-Day creates an equalizing space for marginalized people to connect to caring members of their community. \n \nTo assist homeless guests with ongoing challenges, the Make- A-Day Foundation has established innovative partnerships with local health, behavioral health, criminal justice, community and social service agencies. These partnerships provide access to “on-the-spot” presumptive Medicaid health insurance coverage, on-sight medical, behavioral health, dental and vision service care referral, and on-site care and smart justice opportunities. \n \nMake-A-Day Foundation outreach takes a relationship-centered approach that helps guests explore opportunities and avail themselves of resources that they may not otherwise consider through more traditional outreach approaches.\n \nMake-A-Day Foundation's mobile program also provides a holistic set of opportunities. They use embedded, masters-level social worker and trained volunteers partner with other agency outreach programs to complete referrals and provide follow ups for health, mental health, substance use care, housing, employment and other health, social service and criminal justice opportunities. Their team leverages their human services expertise and relationships with guests to remove barriers to services, benefits and meaningful connections to the community.\n                     \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in supporting the Make -A - Day Foundation’s Community Appreciation & Opportunity Team (CAOT) outreach program which will provide holistic opportunities to homeless residents.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with the Make -A - Day Foundation in support of their Community Appreciation & Opportunity Team\" (CAOT) outreach program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
