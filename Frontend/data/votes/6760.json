    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a construction contract, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with C.D. Whitfield Company LLC, for the Reeb Avenue Center Boiler Replacement Project, in the amount of $127,646.00.  The City will complete an Environmental Review Record and obtain an Authorization to Utilize Grant Funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the project prior to the execution of the construction contract. \n \nThe scope of work includes the replacement of the boiler in the mechanical room at the Reeb Avenue Center.  The contractor will also provide all testing and training for maintenance personnel.\n \n2. CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The project was let by the Office of Construction Management via Vendor Services and Bid Express. Two bids were opened on April 7, 2023 from the following Majority-designated vendors:\n \n1.   C.D. Whitfield Company LLC          $127,646.00\n2.   General Temperature Control           $193,000.00 \n \nC.D. Whitfield’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $127,646.00.  Their Contract Compliance Number is 2105 (in process of updating), Majority-owned firm.   Searches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against C.D. Whitfield Company.\n \n3. MINORITY CONTRACT PARTICIPATION:  Of the 436 vendors solicited, 159 were Minority-owned, 2 Veteran-owned, 270 Small Business-owned, and 100 Women-owned.  C.D. Whitfield Company did not propose any minority designated subcontractors.  A goal was not assigned by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion due to the low estimated amount of the project. \n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Construction needs to be finished by December 31, 2023 in order to meet the requirements of the CDBG grant.  Emergency designation will eliminate 6 weeks of downtime.  Materials should be ordered as soon as possible due to current supply-chain issues.  Having the necessary materials on order will enable the contractor to mobilize and finish construction by the December 31, 2023 deadline.\n \n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT:  Funding for this project will come from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program provides annual grants on a formula basis to cities and counties to develop viable urban communities.  An appropriation of funds will be needed to align this Ordinance with the Draft FY 2023 Annual Action Plan as approved by City Council through the adoption of Ordinance No. 3353-2022.\n \nThe appropriation and expenditure of $127,646.00 will be needed within the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to enter into a construction contract with C.D. Whitfield Company LLC for the Reeb Avenue Center Boiler Replacement Project; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of funds in an amount up to $127,646.00 within the Community Development Block Grant Fund (CDBG); and to declare an emergency.  ($127,646.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, two bids for the Reeb Avenue Center Boiler Replacement Project were received and publicly opened in the office of the Director of Finance and Management on April 7, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid was from C.D.
