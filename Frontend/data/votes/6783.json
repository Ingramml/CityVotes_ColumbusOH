The contract amount for M&D Blacktop, for the construction portion of this project, is $1,425,165.20, with a contingency of $72,834.80, for a total of $1,498,000.00. The contract amount for Anser Advisory, for the construction management and inspection services portion of this project, is $99,725.63. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,599,725.63 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nEach year, the Recreation and Parks Department allocates a portion of the Capital Improvements Budget for the improvement of existing hard surfaces and new installations of hard surfaces. This particular contract focuses on the improvement of asphalt and concrete surfaces that are highly used by the public and includes entry drives, parking lots, trails, sidewalks, and sport courts.  By improving these surfaces, safe and easy access can be ensured to the parks and facilities. Areas for improvement were initially considered through recommendations from internal staff and public involvement. All requests were assessed through a Pavement Condition Rating (PCR) form and were given a rating from 0, meaning the worst condition, to 100, meaning the best condition. All requests were prioritized for action based on their respective PCR scores. From there, staff confirmed which projects to move forward with.\n \nThis project provides improvements at locations throughout the City of Columbus, including Greene Countrie Park, Stoneridge Park, Joan Park, Cremeans Park, Karns Park, Parkridge Park, Amvet Village Park, Holton Park, Three Creeks Park, Big Walnut Park, Wolfe Park, Carriage Place Park, Franklin Park and Krumm Park. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nConstruction:\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on March 27, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on April 18, 2023.

M&D Blacktop and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nConstruction Management and Inspection Services:\n \nProposals were advertised to four pre-qualified Construction Management and Inspection firms that were pre-qualified through the bi-annual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on April 19, 2022 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on April 26, 2023.
