    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Trail Connector Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of grant and matching funds. The grant amount is $4,294,938.00 and the local match amount is $3,470,053.85. This ordinance also authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Complete General Construction for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Trail Connector Project. The contract amount is $6,578,969.16, with a contingency of $658,000.00, for a total of $7,236,696.16. An additional $528,295.69 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for this project. There is a total of $7,764,991.85 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nIn 2018, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department was awarded federal grant funding from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), administered by Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), to assist towards construction of a trail connection to the Scioto Trail for the Franklinton Community, from West Broad Street to Dublin Road. The project’s grant funding is administered by ODOT under a Local Participation Agreement for Project PID 105736, as authorized by Ordinance 0442-2023. This project will build a pedestrian bridge across the Scioto River, from the Scioto Trail, and continue to West Broad Street along a 10 foot wide trail. This corridor, Franklinton Community, is experiencing a transformation with new dense mixed-use developments of housing and large scale employment centers. This project coincides with major development projects in the West Broad Street and Souder Avenue area of Franklinton, including a new corporate campus on Souder Avenue and McKinley Avenue which is anticipated to bring approximately 2,000 jobs into to the community. City staff began engagement with the community several years ago to address the unsafe conditions for cyclists and pedestrians, including the existing two-lane Souder Avenue roadway bridge over the Scioto River. Connectivity to the regional trail system, as well as upgrading the neighborhood’s walking and cycling network, are listed as the community’s highest priorities. The Department of Public Service (DPS) will provide the construction inspection of the project. The construction of the project is intended to be completed in the summer of 2024.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on March 31, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on April 25, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nComplete General Construction (MAJ): $6,578,696.16\nDouble Z Construction Company (MAJ): $6,723,011.89\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Complete General Construction was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Complete General Construction and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nComplete General Construction Company\n1221 East Fifth Avenue\nColumbus, Ohio 43219                                                      \nLee Guzzo, (614) 258-9515\nContract Compliance Number: 006056\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 10, 2025\n \nOhio Department of Transportation (ODOT)\n400 East William Street\nDelaware, Ohio 43015\nAnthony Turowski, Deputy Director, District 6, (740) 833-8397\nGovernment Agency\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to meet the required ODOT Federal grant funding fiscal deadline in June of 2023, securing the grant dollars available for the project.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The Franklinton Community is one of the city’s most disadvantaged areas for safe accessibility to parks and trails. The existing Souder Avenue roadway bridge is a heavily used bike and pedestrian route, with regional trails connecting to it on both banks of the Scioto River. This two lane bridge is recognized widely as one of the city’s most unsafe and narrow crossings. Manual trail counts were conducted and found that the average daily use of the Souder Avenue Bridge by pedestrians and cyclists was approximately 250 uses per day. This equates to roughly 90,000 uses annually. These numbers place the Souder Avenue Bridge connection near the top five busiest counted sections in the Columbus trail system. The Broad Street and Souder Avenue corridor is also experiencing major redevelopment. The neighborhood strongly supports increased safety and access to the regional trail system with leads to jobs, parks, and downtown Columbus. The project will design a new separated facility to accommodate cyclists, runners, and walkers as part of an overall Franklinton Loop network to connect people to and from an underserved community. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Recreation and Parks Department has conducted extensive outreach for this project, involving public and private stakeholders in the Franklinton Community including Franklinton Development Association, \nFranklinton Trade Association, Franklinton Civic Association, Mount Carmel, Cover My Meds, YAY Bikes, Experience Columbus, as well as the Columbus Economic Development, Planning, Public Service, and Health Departments.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Franklinton (54)\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing expanded and equitable access to greenways, trails, and parks.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $4,294,938.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. This ordinance will also authorize a grant match of $3,470,053.85 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. $3,470,053.85 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this grant match. There is a total of $7,764,991.85 available for this project. $7,764,991.85 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 and Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Trail Connector Project and accept a grant in the amount of $4,294,938.00; to authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Complete General Construction for the Franklinton Loop - Souder Avenue Trail Connector Project; to authorize the appropriation of $4,294,938.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund ; to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of $3,470,053.85 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
