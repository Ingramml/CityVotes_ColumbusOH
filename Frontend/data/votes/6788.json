    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Red Clay Consulting, Inc. (RCC) for managed and project services related to Oracle’s customer cloud service meter data management system (Oracle CCS) that supports the Department of Public Utilities’ (DPU) Enhanced Meter Project. The term of the contract will be for one-year from the date of execution by the City.\n \nIn 2019, DPU initiated the Enhanced Meter Project (EMP) and awarded Sensus, a subsidiary of Xylem, a contract to install smart meters, implement the Sensus Regional Network Interface (RNI) head-end system to collect meter reads, and implement Oracle’s CCS meter data management system. RCC was the subcontractor that was responsible for implementing Oracle’s CCS. RCC is a partner with Oracle Utilities and Oracle Cloud, with specializations in multiple Oracle Cloud services.\n \nThe meter data management system is live in production and various system integrations are complete. Due to departmental resource constraints, DPU wishes to continue receiving professional and managed service support from RCC for Oracle CCS. Under the proposed contract, RCC will continue its focus on CCS production issue triage, submission of Oracle product service requests including their escalation, and providing manual regression analysis, along with manual and automated testing of CCS product releases prior to deployment to DPU’s Oracle hosted environments. These services are intended to avoid quality of service impacts to DPU customers that may arise during the mass meter deployment period.\n \nWhile other vendors provide support for Oracle CCS, because RCC provisioned, configured and implemented DPU’s meter data management system, they are the only vendor who can provide the necessary support for the system configurations and processes related to the City’s meter data management. Thus, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a contract with Red Clay Consulting, Inc. for these services.\n \n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nRed Clay Consulting, Inc. | EIN on file | D365 #033208 | Expired August 5, 2022\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nThis contract was not budgeted for; however, the $900,970.00 will be covered by foregoing and or delaying projects that were budgeted for, but are of less immediate need.\n \n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n$0.00 was spent in 2021\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Red Clay Consulting, Inc. for managed and project services related to Oracle’s customer cloud service meter data management system; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; and to authorize the expenditure of $900,970.00 split among the Electricity, Water, and Sanitary Sewer Operating Funds.
