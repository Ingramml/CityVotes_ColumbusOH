    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a non-profit service contract with Impact Community Action to implement the Empowered! program and support energy efficient, sustainable neighborhoods in line with the City’s Columbus Climate Action Plan. Empowered! is a clean-energy jobs program geared toward Columbus residents ages 18-24. The program will provide training and on-the-job experience for careers in the clean-energy sector and focus on recruiting participants from communities of color and women in Opportunity Neighborhoods. These services cannot be provided by current city employees.\n \nFunding will support three cohorts of program participants over the next year, providing training to establish the skills and knowledge needed to be a competitive candidate for full-time employment within the clean-energy sector. Training will also highlight career exploration; digital literacy; diversity, equity and inclusion; and wraparound services.\n \nAdditionally, Empowered! participants will receive on-the-job experience as Energy Advocates, helping residents navigate and better understand energy efficiency and the range of energy programs available to them. They will also perform low-level energy audits and simple energy upgrades such as LED-bulb replacement. Participants will be paid $17 per hour as Energy Advocates and receive compensation for their training.  \n \nUpon completion of the program, Empowered! graduates will be placed in pre-apprenticeships or apprenticeships, or directly employed in fields such as weatherization, construction, utilities, solar installation and manufacturing. The Empowered! Program will advance both the Columbus Climate Action Plan and environmental justice by supporting those communities most impacted by climate change.\n \nAdditionally, this funding will also support the expansion of IMPACT’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), which will provide home energy conservation assistance including housing unit inspections; attic, wall and basement insulation; and access to energy-efficient applications to help lower home energy costs and reduce environmental pollutants for customers who are between 200-300% FPL. The funding also includes support for energy-efficient appliance upgrades for traditional WAP participants (below 200% of the FPL).\n \nThis contract(s) will include program expenses beginning January 1, 2023.\nImpact Community Action, FID 205536173, CC#CC001447, expires 11/17/2023\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested so that workforce development efforts can begin as quickly as possible to ensure that training, skill development, apprenticeship programming and eventual direct employment can begin as quickly as possible to enhance employment as well as sustainability efforts.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes a transfer and appropriation of $2,680,000.00 from the General Fund to the Sustainable Columbus Fund and the expenditure of $2,680,000.00 from the Sustainable Columbus Fund, to Impact Community Action for implementation of the Empowered! Program and neighborhood energy efficiency measures. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a non-profit service contract with Impact Community Action for implementation of the Empowered!
