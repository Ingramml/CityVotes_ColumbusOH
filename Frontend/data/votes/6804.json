The models are:\n \nIncubator Model:  The organization will proactively invest in an idea or domain area, taking it through incubation, market analysis, and product development with invested resources.  This direct influence on creating a solution requires high investment but allows for building and influencing of solutions to impact a defined area of work.  The projects are longer term commitments and iterative to get to impact outcomes and are funded by grants and community investment.\nConsulting Model:  This model uses Smart Columbus as a project manager on selected projects or ideas owned by existing entities, businesses, and/or partners.  These engagements could be more short term and are funded by a project management fee.\n \nSmart Columbus supports plans and activities related to the City’s broadband and digital equity initiatives.\nThese funds will be also be used to study and plan further efforts to scale solutions that close the digital divide in the City of Columbus.\n \nThe City’s Department of Technology has worked the Franklin County Digital Equity Coalition, a collaboration of multiple partners across the city including the Columbus Metropolitan Libraries, the YWCA, Jewish Family Services, MORPC, NDIA and others throughout the pandemic to find ways to provide affordable and quality internet to opportunity neighborhoods in the city.  The city has piloted in two (2) neighborhoods during the pandemic and has evolved throughout the pilot period with different iterations.  Throughout these pilots, the City of Columbus and DEC have learned many of the challenges that are unique to the city.  The city, via contract with Smart Columbus, will enter into a planning process for moving the initiative forward across the city.\n \nIn 2023, current work falls into four areas of focus with each area representing a proactive “bet” to create opportunity as a city of the future:\nMobility-Ensure Columbus continues to lead in smart mobility\nSustainability-Adoption of Climate Technologies to achieve Carbon Neutrality\nDigitalization-Modernize the resident experience inclusively\nEmerging-Stay ahead of emerging urban technologies\n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.                         \n \nFiscal Impact:   The funding of $500,000.00 for this contract will be transferred from the General Fund Citywide Account to the Department of Development General Fund Budget. \n \nContract Compliance:  The contract compliance number is 040255 and expires 11/30/23.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a non-profit services contract with Columbus Partnership, DBA Smart Columbus LLC in an amount up to $500,000.00 to support the ongoing efforts and work of the Smart Columbus organization;
