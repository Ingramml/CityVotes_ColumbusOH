    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background:\nThe Department of Public Service received a request from the Recreation and Parks Department asking that the City extinguish the right-of-way and transfer a 0.039 acre portion of right-of-way to be combined with Franklin County tax parcel numbers 010-051343 and 010-034593.  The right-of-way area is an unnamed alley which runs east / west directionally and is between PID 010-051343 and PID 010-034593.  The area is bounded by E. Barthman Avenue to the north; Bruck Street to the east; Hinkle Avenue to the south; and S. 6th Street to the west. \n \nExtinguishing the right-of-way and transferring the asset will facilitate improvements and enhancements to city-owned property. This right-of-way is within Park boundaries and should not exist as City right-of-way but should be under the control of the Recreation and Parks Department.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by extinguishing this right-of-way and transferring the asset among City Departments.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the asset as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way. \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on January 16, 2020.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted that same day to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department at no cost to them.\n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:\nThere is no fiscal impact to the city to transfer the right-of-way.\n \nTitle\nTo extinguish a 0.039 acre portion of right-of-way and transfer the property and control thereof to the Recreation and Parks Department.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service received a request from the Recreation and Parks Department asking that the City extinguish the right-of-way and transfer a 0.039 acre portion of right-of-way to be combined with Franklin County tax parcel numbers 010-051343 and 010-034593.  The right-of-way area is an unnamed alley which runs east / west directionally and is between PID 010-051343 and PID 010-034593.  The area is bounded by E.
