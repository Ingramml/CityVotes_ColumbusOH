The total amount of this grant is $75,000.\n \nAging Solutions in Central Ohio Inc. is a long-time partner of the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging (COAAA), in that it provides supportive services to older adults in Central Ohio, including community-based services, family and caregiver education, aging-specific professional and paraprofessional development, referral to supportive services, and emergency assistance. Specifically, COAAA partners with Aging Solutions in Central Ohio Inc. to provide supportive medical equipment and home improvement that is necessary for residents as they age. \n \nThe older adult population in Central Ohio is growing rapidly. Central Ohio is currently home to over 381,000 older adults. By 2025, the number of residents over 60 is expected to grow to 441,900; by 2030, it will be over 477,500. This rapid growth, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising cost of inflation, has placed a strain on Aging Solutions to Central Ohio Inc.’s resources and limited its ability to provide services to residents.
