    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Ready2Go Restroom Trailers Sales, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, for the Forestry Nursery Restroom Trailer Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $43,400.00.\n \nThe restroom trailer will serve the Forestry Section staff at the Shadeville Nursery located at 6977 South High Street. This facility currently has a single restroom serviced by an on-site septic system. This single restroom served the nursery fine for many years with six male staff members. The number of staff working at this location has doubled over the past few years. Also, the staff at this location is now comprised of male and female staff. The single restroom quickly became inadequate and a portable bathroom was added to offer temporary relief. This restroom trailer will provide the team with two additional heated, cooled, flushable toilet restrooms. The wastewater from this unit will be stored in a holding tank and removed by a mobile unit. \n \nIt is a possibility that this nursery will need to be relocated in the next five to ten years due to planned expansions of the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant. Therefore, the Recreation and Parks Department does not think investing in permanent facility improvements at this site would be prudent. The portable restroom trailer is an economical solution to support our staff. Also, this unit can be further utilized in the future at other Columbus Recreation and Parks Department facilities or events.     \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, by the Purchasing Office, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, on March 15, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on April 6, 2023.  \n \nBids were received from the following companies:\n \nReady2Go Restroom Trailers Sales (MAJ): $43,400.00 \n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Ready2Go Restroom Trailers Sales was the lowest and most responsive bidder.
