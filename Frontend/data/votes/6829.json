    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Designing Local for the 2023 Signage Program Update - Phase 1 Project. The contract amount is $49,236.00, with reimbursable expenses of $679.00, for a total of $49,915.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has progressed its signage program significantly in the past few years. With this momentum, the opportunity exists to create a meaningful story and new message strategy to celebrate the mission, vision, and narrative of the Department while defining the updated signage guidelines. This brand strategy will strengthen the sense of place at facilities and parks, promoting current initiatives that improve connectivity for neighbors and visitors within the renewed connections. The goal of this project is to collaborate with the sign professionals to do a holistic analysis of the signage master plan, brand position, 2D print, 3D environment, and digital applications to understand success criteria for the future. As part of this project, this audit and analysis will create a deep understanding of the drivers, challenges, key criteria, and opportunities to deliver a best-in-class signage experience throughout the Recreation and Parks Department. This project will also focus on donor appreciation signs, interior building signs, park entrance signage, interpretive signage, golf course signage, aquatics facility signage, community center exterior signage, and signage guidelines refinement. The consultant team and the Design & Construction Section will work closely with Columbus Recreation and Parks Department graphic designers and the internal Signage Committee throughout all phases of this project. This project will design prototypes of the updated sign families and develop updated fabrication, installation, and construction specifications to create cost savings for future sign packages.\n \nSigns serve an important role in strengthening the identity of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department. Signs aid in helping residents find their way to and within parks and facilities. Park signs are often the first amenity that residents see or look for when entering a park, setting the tone for the experience the residents can expect. The Department’s current sign system is partially outdated and does not fully reflect Columbus Recreation and Parks Department branding and identity goals. Updating signs will enhance park user’s ability to understand critical wayfinding information and integrate more closely with the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department brand. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter 329, on March 1, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 17, 2023.  \n \nProposals were received from the following companies:\n \nDesigning Local (WBE)\nSelbert Perkins Design (WBE)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor were they part of this evaluation. \n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended Designing Local be selected to perform the work.  The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDesigning Local\n1223 East Main Street\nColumbus, Ohio 43205                                                    \nMatt Leasure, (614) 893-7178                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number: 020995\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 14, 2023\n \nBenefits to the Public: Signs serve an important in helping residents find their way to and within parks and facilities. Park signs are often the first amenity that residents see or look for when entering a park and the Department’s current sign system is outdated. Updating signs will enhance the community’s ability to find and navigate within facilities and parks. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community members have shared park sign concerns and sign replacement requests through 311 and other forms of communication. Community members have also expressed a need for more accessible signage through graphic design improvements and alternative languages.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department Master Plan by improving overall design standards. By improving departmental signage throughout the system, this project will also improve the safety of facilities and parks while removing access and circulation barriers.\n \nFiscal Impact: $49,915.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Designing Local for the 2023 Signage Program Update - Phase 1 Project; to authorize the transfer of $49,915.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; and to authorize the expenditure of $49,915.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
