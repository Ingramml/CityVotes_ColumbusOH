    "description": "Explanation   \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract renewal with Patrick Engineering Inc., for the O’Shaughnessy Hydro Turbine Improvements project, CIP #690444-100000, in an amount up to $900,482.00. \n  \nThe goal of this project is to repair major components for the O’Shaughnessy Hydro Turbine Facility. The facility is more than thirty years old and its major components are in need of repair, including the turbines, generators, controls, and electrical gear.  Currently, only one of the two turbines is operational.  This contract provides engineering services to design the improvements needed to restore the facility to fully working condition.  \n \nThis Contract Renewal (No. 3) requests additional funding for Phase 3 - Engineering Services during Construction.\n \nPlanning Area:  99 - Citywide \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $900,482.00\n \n                     Original Contract (ORD 2690-2014; EL016667)                                                                                                                              $250,000.00 \n                     Mod. 1 - Preliminary Design (ORD 1859-2017; PO079426)                                                                                        $1,798,103.39\n                     Ren. 2 - Services During Construction (ORD 2746-2020; PO 257536)                                                          $1,000,000.00\n                     Ren. 3 - Services During Construction (current request)                                                                                                         $900,482.00\n                     Ren. 4 - Services During Construction (future request)                                                                                                            $500,000.00\n \n                                                                                                                                                                                             Total                     $4,448,585.39\n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a contract renewal.  Patrick Engineering Inc., has been providing these services under contract with planned renewals to add funding for future years.  Rebidding the contract and using another company would be more expensive as the new company would need to spend time learning and redoing work already performed by Patrick Engineering Inc.\n \n1.3. How the cost of renewal was determined:\nCost was determined between negotiations with the Department of Public Utilities and the vendor based on rates established under the existing contract. \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe refurbished power plant will produce electrical power supplied to everyone on the regional grid with zero carbon emissions.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO\nPatrick Engineering Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-007237 and expires 8/11/22. The contract renewal will not be executed until Patrick Engineering’s contract compliance is renewed. \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) were not required for this contract as no State or Federal money will be used to pay for contracted services.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Patrick Engineering Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Patrick Engineering is using the following subconsultants for this contract renewal:\nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nStantec                                                                                                                Columbus, OH                                                                                          MAJ\nThe MBE/WBE percentage for this contract renewal will be 0%.\n5.  FISCAL IMPACT \nThere are sufficient funds within the Water G.O.
