    "description": "Explanation\n \nColumbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health, with some of the funding originating from the Centers for Disease Control.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $132,000.00 in grant monies to fund the FY24 Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Grant Program for the period of July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024.  \n \nThe Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Program will increase the readiness of our community to initiate and engage in tobacco control and cessation strategies with an anticipated outcome of creating social norm change to decrease initiation and use of tobacco in local communities (including the initiation of the use of e-cigarettes/vaping products), to increase quitting of tobacco, to decrease the community’s exposure to secondhand smoke, and to decrease disparities in tobacco burden usually associated with health inequities.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is fully funded by the Centers for Disease Control and the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City match ($132,000.00).   \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control for the FY24 Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Grant Program in the amount of $132,000.00;
