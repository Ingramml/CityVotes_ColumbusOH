    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with Double Z Construction Company for the Dublin Road Erosion Repair project and to provide payment for construction, construction administration and inspection services.  \n \nA Mayor’s Emergency letter was issued on March 10, 2021, to establish a contract with Double Z Construction Company for construction services in an amount of up to $76,542.00. The Department of Public Service will provide the administration and inspection services in an amount of up to $13,458.00 for a total amount of $90,000.00 needed for the repair.  Significant erosion along Dublin Road due to large flood events forced the closure of the right eastbound lane.  The erosion continues to worsen and is encroaching on the pavement.  The erosion could soon expose a 36’ water main if not resolved before heavy spring rain, necessitating the need for an emergency repair.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Double Z Construction Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Double Z Construction Company is CC005966 and expires 6/10/2021.\n \n3.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nDouble Z Construction Company has met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $90,000.00 is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget is needed to match cash and to transfer budget authority to the proper project.  A transfer of funds and appropriation between projects with Fund 7704 are necessary to align funding with the proper project.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to make repairs to Dublin Road as quickly as possible to protect public infrastructure and ensure public safety.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with Double Z Construction Company for the Dublin Road Erosion Repair project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $90,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($90,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary to enter into contract for an amount of up to $90,000.00 to provide funds for the Dublin Road Erosion Repair project to complete the necessary emergency repairs;

and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to match cash and transfer cash and appropriation to provide funding for project expenditures; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with Double Z Construction Company to complete the needed repairs to Dublin Road to protect public infrastructure and ensure public safety, thereby preserving the public health, peace, safety, and welfare;
