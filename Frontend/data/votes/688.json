    "description": "Explanation\nBA21-001\n \nBackground:\n \nA boundary adjustment between the City of Columbus and the City of Hilliard has been proposed. The site is in Frazell Road, from just south of the Collier Hill Drive intersection to Franks Park, and consists entirely of right of way.

This legislation is being filed in response to the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code - section 709.37 regarding municipal boundary adjustments.  Parallel legislation is being submitted to Hilliard City Council.
