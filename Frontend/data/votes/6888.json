    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Ordinance No. 0443-2018 passed by City Council on February 26, 2018 authorized the City to enter into an Economic Development Agreement dated August 28, 2018 (the “EDA”) with Perry Street, LLC concerning the redevelopment of property now formerly owned by the Battelle Memorial Institute. The site consists of approximately 21 acres generally between Fifth Avenue and Third Avenue to the north and south, and Perry Street and the Olentangy River to the east and west (the “Site”). Pursuant to the EDA, the parties contemplated that within the Site there would be an approximately +/- 6.1 acre public parkland consisting of what is now Franklin County Tax Parcel ID’s 010-299006 and 010-299081 (the “Public Parkland”). \n \nTo facilitate the acquisition and development of the Public Parkland, City Council adopted Resolution No. 0153X-2018 on May 21, 2018 and Resolution No. 0325X-2018 on November 5, 2018 to establish the Harrison Market Community Authority (the “Authority”) and its new community district over the Site. Ordinance No. 3140-2018 passed by City Council on November 18, 2018 authorized the assignment of the EDA from Perry Street, LLC to WTD Development, LLC (the “Developer”) and authorized the City, the Authority, and the Developer to enter into the Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement dated December 1, 2018 (the “Agreement”). In accordance with the EDA and the Agreement, the City originally committed to providing up to $2.2 million of funds from the Harrison West Redevelopment Incentive District (the “AC Humko II TIF”) that had been established by City Council pursuant to Ordinance No. 0670-2004 passed on April 26, 2004.\n \nDue to inflation and supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, this legislation is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into the First Amendment to the Agreement (the “First Amendment”) as additional funding is required to be appropriated and expended from monies generated by the AC Humko II TIF to immediately commence and complete the construction of the Public Parkland with the mutually agreed upon vendor selected through a competitive bidding process. \n \nThis Ordinance also authorizes the City’s Recreation and Parks Department Director to enter into a Construction Agreement with the Developer for the construction of the improvements to the Public Parkland; to enter into a Right of Entry and Release of Liability Agreement with the Developer, to enter upon a ±1.8 acre parcel of land owned by the City and identified as Franklin County Auditor Parcel ID No. 010-299006-00, to construct improvements to the Public Parkland; and to enter into a Park Maintenance Agreement with the Authority.\n \nFiscal Impact: The City is appropriating and authorizing the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes and property tax rollback payments generated by the parcels in the AC Humko II TIF that are on deposit in Fund 7425 and Fund 7788 all in accordance with this First Amendment.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is requested to make funds available to the Harrison Market Community Authority so that it may enter into a contract for construction of the public parkland improvements with the selected contractor prior to the expiration of the bid validity period.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a First Amendment to the Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement with the Harrison Market Community Authority and WTD Development, LLC; to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes and property tax rollback payments generated by parcels in the Harrison West Redevelopment Incentive District (AC Humko II TIF) pursuant to the First Amendment to the Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement to provide additional financing for the development of public parkland improvements; to authorize the City’s Recreation and Parks Department Director to enter into a Right of Entry and Release of Liability Agreement and a Construction Agreement with WTD Development, LLC; to authorize the City’s Recreation and Parks Department Director to enter into a Park Maintenance Agreement with the Harrison Market Community Authority; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to Sections 5709.40, 5709.42 and 5709.43 of the Ohio Revised Code, City Council, after giving proper notice to the Columbus City School District, by its Ordinance No. 0670-2004 passed on April 26, 2004 as amended by Ordinance No. 3139-2018 passed on November 19, 2018, created the Harrison West Redevelopment Incentive District (the “AC Humko II TIF”) over certain properties within the Harrison West neighborhood; and\n \nWHEREAS, within the AC Humko II TIF prior to Ordinance No. 3139-2018 was property formally owned by the Battelle Memorial Institute and generally bounded by W.

Third Avenue currently identified as being Franklin County Tax Parcel ID 010-299006, and a ±4.2 acre parcel along the Olentangy River currently identified as Franklin County Tax Parcel ID 010-299081, to be public parkland (together, the parcels comprise the “Public Parkland”); and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to finance the redevelopment of the Site and the Public Parkland, City Council passed Ordinance No. 3140-2018 on November 18, 2018 that authorized the assignment of the EDA from Perry Street, LLC to the WTD Development, LLC (the “Developer”) and authorized the City, the Authority, and the Developer to enter into a Tax Increment Financing and Cooperative Agreement dated December 1, 2018 (the “Agreement”); and \n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to the EDA and the Agreement, the City determined to originally use up to $2.2 million of the service payments in lieu of taxes generated from the AC Humko II TIF to finance the costs to acquire, design, and construct, and install trail improvements, street trees, and park trees on the Public Parkland (collectively, the “Park Improvements”); and\n \nWHEREAS, due to inflation and supply chain issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, the bid to construct the Park Improvements has increased above the originally agreed upon budget in the EDA, and the City has determined that it is in its best interest to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of additional funds generated from the AC Humko II TIF to fund the Park Improvements; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City’s Department of Development desires to enter into a First Amendment to the Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with the Developer and the Authority to provide for the additional funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City’s Recreation and Parks Department desires to enter into a Right of Entry and Release of Liability Agreement and a Construction Agreement with the Developer, and to enter into a Park Maintenance Agreement with the Authority (collectively, the “Park Agreements”) permitting access to the City-owned Franklin County Tax Parcel ID 010-299006, for construction of the Park Improvements on the Public Parkland; and to authorize and require maintenance of the Park Improvements and the Public Parkland by the Authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Development and the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to enter into the First Amendment and the Park Agreements to expedite the availability and remittance of AC Humko II TIF funds to enable the selected vendor to begin constructing the Park Improvements prior to the end of the vendor’s open bid period, thereby saving additional funding by not rebidding, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, safety and welfare without delay; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
