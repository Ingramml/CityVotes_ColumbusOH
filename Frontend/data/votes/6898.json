    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, for the purchase of Trellix (f.k.a. McAfee) Software Support. The Department of Technology uses Trellix software to protect city computer systems against malicious software such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.\nDoT solicited quotes via RFQ024687 for the purchase of Trellix Software Support.  For purposes of evaluating and determining the lowest responsive bid, and in accordance with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual, a bid discount of 5% was applied to bids where the prime contractor is a minority or woman-owned business or a minority or woman-owned joint venture certified with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion in the relevant work classification. Four responses were received as follows:\n \nBIDDER                                                               BID                                          DISCOUNT                                          PRICE\nBrown Enterprise                                          $338,000.00                     $16,900.00                                          $321,100.00\nAxelliant LLC                                                               $334,400.00                      $0.00                                                               $334,400.00\nVprime                                                                                    $342,960.00                      $0.00                                                               $342,960.00\nCDW                                                                                     $344,000.00                     $0.00                                                                $344,000.00\n \nThe Department of Technology has reviewed the responses received and is recommending that award be made to Brown Enterprise Solutions having submitted the lowest, responsive bid, after discount.\nThe term of the above-described contract will be for one year, beginning on July 7, 2023 and ending on July 6, 2024, at a total cost of $338,000.00. The terms of the contract allow for four additional annual renewals with mutual agreement of interested parties.\nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $338,000.00 for above-described purpose.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested as the current contract expires on July 6, 2023. Failure to have a contract in place when the current contract expires would make the city vulnerable to various computer viruses and related issues.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor name:                                           Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC\nDAX vendor no.:                     #010668\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract are budgeted and available in the Information Services operating fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, for Trellix software support; to authorize the expenditure of $338,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
