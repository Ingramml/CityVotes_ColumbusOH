    "description": "Explanation\nNeed: The Civil Service Commission needs to modify the contract and increase the maximum authorized expenditure in the contract with Mount Carmel Occupational Health for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police and Fire Academy classes. This modification is required in order to add funds for upcoming academy classes. Funding is typically added annually or prior to each academy class. The contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes since this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process.\n \nBid Information: In 2019, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFP 013916) for these services and accepted proposals through December 13, 2019. Four proposals were submitted by the deadline. An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP and the Executive Director selected Mount Carmel Occupational Health (Ordinance 0440-2020).\n \nEmergency designation: Emergency legislation is requested in order to allow sufficient time for the Department of Public Safety to continue to schedule police and fire candidates for upcoming recruit classes.\n \nContract Compliance Number: 31-1439334, expires 2/7/2022\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this service was budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2021 general fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the contract with Mount Carmel Occupational Health for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($150,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the contract to Mount Carmel Occupational Health; and\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to modify and increase the contract with Mount Carmel Occupational Health in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes, and thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare; now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to modify and increase the contract with Mount Carmel Occupational Health for the purpose of administering pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress tests to public safety recruits for the Divisions of Police and Fire.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $150,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in object class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
