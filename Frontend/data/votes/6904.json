    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department asking that the City extinguish the right-of-way and transfer the asset of a 0.516 acre portion of right-of-way from the Department of Public Service to the Recreation and Parks Department to be combined with parcels 010-002526 and 010-002527.  The right-of-way area runs north / south directionally; and is between PID 010-002526 and PID 010-002527; with Belvidere Avenue to the west, Doren Avenue to the south, and Lechner Avenue to the east and Floral Avenue to the north. \n \nExtinguishing the right-of-way and transferring the asset will facilitate improvements and enhancements to city-owned property; this right-of-way is within Park boundaries and should not exist as City right-of-way but should be under the control of the Recreation and Parks Department.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by extinguishing this right-of-way and transferring the asset among City Departments.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the asset as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way. \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on January 16, 2020.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department at no cost to them.\n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThe City will receive no funds for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo extinguish a 0.516 acre portion of right-of-way located with  Belvidere Avenue to the west, Doren Avenue to the south, and Lechner Avenue to the east and Floral Avenue to the north; and transfer the asset to The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department.
