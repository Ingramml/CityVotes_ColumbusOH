    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) began accepting applications for its Municipal Bridge Program on January 1, 2023, and applications were due February 28, 2023.  The Municipal Bridge Program provides federal funds to municipal corporations, metroparks and Regional Transit Authorities for bridge replacement or bridge rehabilitation projects.  ODOT will cover up to 95% of eligible costs for construction.  Total awards are capped at $2 million.  In order to receive funding, a bridge must either be on ODOT’s Target Bridge List or be eligible due to inspection results received after the list was generated.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application to replace the Kimberly Parkway Bridge over Mason Run.  The Department of Public Service has had to limit loads on this bridge to 65% of the legal truck load.  The Department estimates the total project cost will be approximately $1,563,413.00.  ODOT recently announced its intention to award funding to the City of this project.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with ODOT in connection with the award of the grant, expend awarded grant funds, and return unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with accepting ODOT Municipal Bridge grant funds by the acceptance deadline of July 14.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to accept a Municipal Bridge Program Grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation in connection to the Kimberly Parkway Bridge Replacement project; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with ODOT and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) announced funding for its Municipal Bridge Program, which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT accepted applications through February 28, 2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to submit an application, execute grant agreements, accept and expend grant funds, and issue refunds if necessary after final accounting for approved projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to accept grant funds and execute agreements with ODOT in connection with the award of the grant by the acceptance deadline of July 14, for the public health, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from ODOT’s Municipal Bridge Program to replace its Kimberly Parkway Bridge over Mason Run.\n \nSECTION 2.
