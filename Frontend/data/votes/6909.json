    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: There is a need to transfer and appropriate funds to provide 2023-2024 funding for the Area Commissions.  Historically, the City has provided funds to the Area Commissions, who, through their daily operational functions, incur eligible expenses that require expenditures during the program year.  These funds allow each Area Commission the flexibility and individuality in decision making as they fulfill their functions and responsibilities as outlined in their bylaws and the Columbus City Codes.  Each Area Commission will receive access to funding of up to $2,500.00 in 2023.\n \nThis legislation will also authorize and request the City Auditor's Office to establish a new subfund within Fund 2221 for combined expenses as they relate to the Area Commissions Operations.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that funds can be made available to the Area Commissions immediately, thereby avoiding interruptions in services in the summer months.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes the transfer of $52,500 from the Department of Neighborhoods General Fund Budget to the Area Commission Fund; and appropriates $52,500 within that fund for the operating expenses of each of the Area Commissions.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $52,500.00 from the Department of Neighborhoods General Fund to the Area Commission Fund; to authorize and direct the City Auditor to appropriate $52,500.00 within the Area Commission Fund for operating expenses of the Area Commissions; to authorize the City Auditor to establish a new subfund within the Area Commissions Fund; and to declare an emergency.
