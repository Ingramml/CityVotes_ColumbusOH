    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Kimley-Horn and Associates to provide architectural and engineering services for the Gender Road Park and McCoy Park Improvements Project. The contract amount is $345,235.28, with a contingency of $68,167.54, for a total of $413,402.82 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nGender Road Park and McCoy Park are two different park parcels owned by the Recreation and Parks Department that are currently undeveloped. Gender Road Park is a 32 acre undeveloped parkland in the City’s South East Community. McCoy Park, along Harmon Avenue, is an underutilized greenspace of nearly 20 acres in the City’s Southwest Community. This project will provide professional services to develop improvements for Gender Road Park and McCoy Park.  The project will involve master planning, conceptual design, park programming, and public engagement.  \n \nFor Gender Road Park, the consultant team will provide a report detailing the existing public recreational facilities in the surrounding three square mile area, conduct public engagement with the surrounding community, and conduct internal program discussions with staff to develop a high quality programming plan for the Recreation and Parks Department to utilize over the next decade of development as the design for this park is put together. The intent of this project for McCoy Park will be to develop a new master plan for the site, followed by a detailed design development plan that can begin implementation in 2024. The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department intends to develop a diverse and inclusive park layout that includes therapeutic recreation space capable of accommodating multiple outdoor sports opportunities, athletic fields, pickleball courts, a splash pad; family park amenities, parking improvements, and access improvements. This contract will be modified at a later date in 2023 to prepare detailed construction documents for construction anticipated to start in mid 2024. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Chapter329, on February 7, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 7, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nCivil and Environmental Consultants (MAJ)\nKimley-Horn (MAJ)\nMannik Smith Group (MAJ)\nMKSK (MAJ)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price. Costs were not requested nor where they part of this evaluation.\n \nIn accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended Kimley-Horn be selected to perform the work.

The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department is looking to add more inclusive opportunities for therapeutic recreation at McCoy Park, which is much needed.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since both parks are undeveloped, a big part of this stage of the process is to heavily involve both the Southwest and South East Communities to get ideas and gather input.
