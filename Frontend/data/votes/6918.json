    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the Master Services Agreement with American Municipal Power, Inc. (AMP) to provide funding for participation in journeyman lineworker safety and training programs. \n \nLineworkers construct and maintain electric poles, transformers, and lines. The Division of Power (DOP) has an active journeyman lineworker training program with another vendor, who, until AMP’s program, was the sole company offering this training locally. AMP’s program is offered in partnership with the Northwest Lineman College, which provides the books and curriculum. Of the two programs to offer the training locally, AMP’s program cost per attendee is the lowest cost option. Thus, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and modify the Master Services Agreement with AMP to include journeyman lineworker safety and training. \n \nThe Division desires to have 18 employees enroll in the training. Overall, the training program is expected to run for four years, with funding provided annually and contingent on mutual agreement between the City and vendor, approval by ordinance of Columbus City Council, and appropriation and certification of funds by the City Auditor\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #19 is $55,500.00.
