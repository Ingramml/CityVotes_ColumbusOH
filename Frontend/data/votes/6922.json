    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. for the Inflow Redirection - Markison, C.I.P. #650790-122181 and Hydraulic Modification to CSO Regulator - Markison, C.I.P. #650790-122182, in an amount up to $47,118.32.  The modification work will be performed for the Wilson Avenue Area Water Line Improvements, C.I.P. #690236-100176.  \n \nThis is an unplanned modification.  The purpose of this modification is to construct necessary improvements to the water distribution system in the Wilson Avenue Area.  The improvements identified in the scope of work will replace or rehabilitate water lines that have high break histories and require frequent maintenance.  This project includes replacing or rehabilitating approximately 3,500 linear feet of 8-inch water lines. The streets include Oakwood Avenue and Linwood Avenue.\n \nThe original contract provided design services for the inflow redirection and hydraulic modification to the combined sewer overflow regulator on Markison Avenue.  The water line work included in this modification was not part of the original scope.  It was not until very late in design that it was realized it would be very beneficial to include water line replacement with the proposed sewer work.  The final configuration of the utilities would make for a very difficult water line replacement in the future, and it made more sense to include the work now and with the sewer project.\n \nThis project is located within the following Community Planning Area:  South Side (63).\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $47,118.32\nOriginal Contract Amount:                         $2,351,141.87                                          (Ord. 3446-2018, PO160968)\nModification #1 (current):                              $47,118.32\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):        $2,398,260.19\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the preliminary design work to date.  Due to the time restrictions of the consent decree for the sewer work to be completed, there is not time to perform a bid process.\n \n1.3. How cost of the modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared a proposal based on the rates used for the existing contact.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed, negotiated, and approved the cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThe goal of this project is to replace or rehabilitate the existing water lines that have a high break frequency.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss.  The Neighborhood Liaison(s) will be contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO\nAECOM Technical Services, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC010897 and expires 6/22/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against AECOM Technical Services, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  AECOM Technical Services, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  AECOM Technical Services, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of one subconsultant that is also classified as a majority company by ODI.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this contract modification is expected to be 0%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, AECOM has proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nMS Consultants                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\n \nThe certification of AECOM Technical Services, Inc. and the above company was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this modification are appropriated and available in the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006. \n \n6.
