    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nIn November of 2021, The Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, in partnership with Yale Law School’s Justice Collaboratory and LaGratta Consulting selected the Columbus City Attorney’s Office as a pilot site for their Elevating Trust and Legitimacy for Prosecutors Project. The goal of the Elevating Trust initiative is to create a model for prosecutors’ offices across the country that builds on the premise that these offices belong to the community, rather than to any elected official or government employee. \n \nThrough the 24-month Elevating Trust project period, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys team assessed how Columbus City Prosecutors interacted with the surrounding community then worked hand in hand with the Prosecution Unit to develop and implement evidence-based practices for increasing public safety and trust. Based on the lessons learned through assessment period and the public safety strategies identified, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys is awarding the City Attorney’s Prosecution Unit a small private grant to support activities identified under unit’s Elevating Trust- Gun Safety strategy ($5,500). \n \nAssociation of Prosecuting Attorneys funds will support 1) food costs for two community impact panel discussions on gun safety, and 2) fees associated with sending twenty-four Columbus residents through certified firearm safety courses. The panel discussions will include representatives from Columbus Division of Police, Columbus Public Health's Care Coalition, The Ohio State University Star Program, community corrections, the faith community and local neighborhood associations to discuss gun violence, accidental gun deaths and the traumatic impacts that these types of incidents have on individuals and neighborhoods. Panelists will also discuss best-practices for safe gun handling and storage. These community conversations in tandem with firearm safety trainings will cultivate a deeper understanding of the impact of gun violence on communities (and families) and promote responsible gun ownership. These activities will also foster public trust and increase safety.\n \nThe Association of Prosecuting Attorneys is a national 501(c)(3) established in 2009. It is a professional association of elected and appointed prosecutors who are dedicated to leading nationwide training and technical assistance initiatives. The association also serves as a national clearinghouse for innovative and effective prosecutorial practices. This award and national recognition are true testaments to our City’s commitment to engaging community in public safety solutions.\n \nThe City Attorney’s Office requests authorization to set up an Elevating Trust Private Grant Fund; to accept the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys $5,500 cash award; to appropriate $5,500 within the Private Grant Fund; and to appropriate future awards/donations to the Private Grant Fund in support of Elevating Trust activities.   \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide the funds necessary to cover costs associated with hosting the June Elevating Trust gun safety panel discussion.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNone. No City cash match is required to accept this award.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the creation of an Elevating Trust Private Grant Fund within the City Attorney’s Office; to authorize the acceptance of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys $5,500.00 award supporting Elevating Trust project activities; to authorize the appropriation of $5,500.00 within the Private Grant Fund; to authorize the appropriation of future Elevating Trust awards and donations to the Private Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency.($5,500.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City Attorney’s Elevating Trust project is eligible to accept awards sponsored by Association of Prosecuting Attorneys; and\n \nWHEREAS, by establishing the Elevating Trust Private Grant Fund, the Elevating Trust project is able to accept this award and future awards/donations from various organizations in support of innovative prosecution practices designed to develop public trust and promote safety.\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Attorney’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Attorney accept this private grant award and appropriate funds to cover costs associated with hosting the June Elevating Trust gun safety panel discussion; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
