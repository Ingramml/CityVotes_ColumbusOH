CPH will support at least one community improvement plan that includes the potential assessment of local community design as it relates to improving safe and equitable access to physical activity (including number of federal, state or local partners formally engaged) as well as at least two alternative commuting facilities, programs or services created or enhanced that support equitable access that can be used by the priority population in each community to safely travel to essential services, including jobs, medical appointments, grocery stores or food pantries, taking into effect how local demand has changed during COVID-19.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible given the grant start date of April 1, 2021.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is funded by the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City match.
