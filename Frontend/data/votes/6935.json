    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify and extend a service contract with Civil and Environmental Consultants, Inc., to add funds in the amount of $45,000.00; to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute contract modifications if needed to clarify terms and conditions of the contract or to implement program improvements and enhancements. The Department of Public Service has an ongoing need for contractual services for explosive gas monitoring and reporting therein, at the former Franklin County landfill sites, which is required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. This is a planned contract modification. \n \nIn 2020, the Department of Public Service solicited Requests for Proposals (Solicitation RFQ015889) for explosive gas monitoring services for the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection. The contract was to be used for repairing and/or replacing, inspecting, and monitoring all aspects of explosive gas monitoring equipment at former landfill sites in Franklin County. The 2020 service contract and PO238090 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Civil and Environmental Consultants, Inc., which was the bidder that submitted the only proposal.  Recent EPA requirements require additional monitoring be performed at the Jackson Pike landfill site. The RFQ Scope of Contracted Service section allows for additional services to be requested as part of the contract. The cost for additional monitoring, and related reporting therein, was provided by the contractor, and approved by the Division of Refuse Administrator, and the Department of Public Service Operations Fiscal Manager. \n \nPublic Service would like to modify and extend the contract to continue this service, and to add funds in the amount of up to $45,000.00 to pay for these additional services.  \n \n \nThe original contract amount:                                                  $10,000.00                   (PO238090)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                              $15,000.00                   (PO288156)\nThe total of Modification No. 2                                                                                         $35,825.00                                       (PO326405)\nThe total of Modification No.3                                                                                          $45,000.00                                        (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                       $95,825.00\n \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Civil and Environmental Consultants, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nCivil and Environmental Consultants, Inc. contract compliance number is CC001963 and expires 5/19/2024.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis contract modification and expenditure is planned and appropriated in the Division of Refuse Collection's 2023 General Fund budget.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow timely execution of this contract, to prevent a lapse of in monitoring at the landfill sites so the appropriate reports can be submitted to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) by the required deadlines.
