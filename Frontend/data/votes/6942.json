    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 and enter into a professional services contract with Designing Local Ltd., in an amount up to $750,000.00, for the City’s “Reimagining Columbus” project that is funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation’s “Monuments Project” program grant.\n \nDesigning Local Ltd shall serve as the City’s lead consultant for the “Reimagining Columbus” project.  Through the Department of Development, the City applied for a grant to engage the community and generate discussion about the city’s namesake, Christopher Columbus, and to assess the future disposition of the Christopher Columbus statue that was created by Edoardo Alfieri and gifted to the City of Columbus by its Sister City of Genoa, Italy in 1955. The purpose of this project is to 1) methodically and inclusively host conversations to understand what Columbus residents value most, and how the city’s future symbology and public art landscape can communicate shared values and aspirations, 2) provide the public with opportunities to collaboratively ideate on the future disposition of the Christopher Columbus statue, and with requisite community buy-in, design a new space that allows the public to understand and physically interact with difficult history, and 3) create a replicable model for dealing with difficult topics within the community and pilot new community engagement methodologies, including restorative practices.\n \nThe City proposed the Reimagining Columbus project to the Mellon Foundation and was awarded a $2 million grant. As the lead consultant for project, Designing Local will be responsible for project management, community engagement, landscape architecture, and oversight of sub consultants.  Sub Consultants will include experts in public engagement, cultural competency, public art, place making, and design and augmented with the perspectives of Advisory Committees composed of local residents and community leaders. The project will use conventional and restorative practices to glean insight and support the sharing of different perspectives and lived experiences.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to execute the professional services contract as soon as possible to complete the work during the term of the grant.\n \nWaiver of Request for Proposal Requirements:  A waiver of the competitive procurement requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is being requested because Designing Local Ltd. previously was selected as the chosen consultant in response to RFQ021527.  A contract was not awarded under RFQ021527 because program scope evolved in light of the private grant opportunity with the Monuments Project.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The funding of $750,000.00 for this contract is available in the Private Grant Fund (2291) Mellon Foundation-Monuments Project grant (grant number to be determined) and contingent upon Ordinance 1857-2023. Funding from the Mellon Foundation shall be disbursed to the City in two tranches:  one half in summer of 2023 and one half in summer 2024.  Upon receipt of the funds in 2024, legislation will be put forth to modify this contract to add the additional funds.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor’s contract compliance 020995 is active and expires on 7/14/24.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Designing Local Ltd in an amount up to $750,000.00 for the purpose of project management, community engagement, landscape architecture and facilitating the community in public discussion about the future disposition of the Christopher Columbus statue in accordance with the Monuments Project scope; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329; to authorize the expenditure of $750,000.00 from the Department of Development’s Mellon Foundation Grant budget (Private Grant Fund); and to declare an emergency. ($750,000.00)\n \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in June of 2023, the Andrew W.
