FISCAL IMPACT\nThis design modification is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority.  Non-construction loans do not have a nomination deadline for pre-approval for this source of funding and are nominated as the need for financing arises.    \n \nThis Ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Water System Reserve Fund,Fund 6003, to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund, Fund 6011, in order to fund this proposed expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the Division is able to execute a loan with the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund and reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in July 2023. The funds will also need to be appropriated in Fund 6011.   An amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget will also be necessary.  \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for General Engineering Services for the Fourth Water Plant with Hazen and Sawyer and to apply, accept, and enter into a Water Supply Revolving Loan Account loan agreement with the Ohio Water Development Authority and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the financing thereof and designate a dedicated source of repayment for the loan; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $11,838,000.00 from the Water System Reserve Fund to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $11,838,000.00 within the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund; to authorize an amendment to the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; and to declare an emergency.
