    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a contract with Triumph Communications for an educational campaign for the general public on the Columbus districts. \nIn December 2021, Columbus City Council selected the first Official Council District Map. This map created city-wide representation for all residents by creating geographic diversity in where councilmembers reside. This November, residents will head to the polls and vote for the districts for the first time. It is imperative that residents be educated on how to use this new system and how it will affect them and their families. \nTriumph Communications will develop a community-wide education and marketing campaign on the importance of understanding how districts will impact residents and their neighbors. Triumph will develop a wider message platform and resources to reach inclusive demographics within Columbus. The education campaign will be comprised of television, digital, social and radio. \nWhile an informal bidding process was utilized, a bid waiver to enter into contract with Triumph Communications is requested in order to create a media campaign in support of the transition to Columbus districts. Triumph Communications has prior and thorough familiarity with the City of Columbus district transition and is best positioned to immediately initiate services prior to the general election in November.\nFiscal impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in ensuring that residents are properly informed regarding the new districts. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a contract with Triumph Communications for an educational campaign for the general public on the Columbus districts; to authorize an appropriation and an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
