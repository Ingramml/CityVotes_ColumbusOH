    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:\nThis ordinance NO. 0867-2021 authorizes expenditures of $27,000,000 for the implementation and support of a modern revenue management system. This legislation authorizes the City Auditor to enter into contract with FAST Enterprises and other vendors necessary\nThe City of Columbus currently uses a collection of 125 legacy tax applications and batch processes maintained by the Department of Technology to collect, audit, and enforce the City’s income, admissions, hotel/motel, excise, and short-term rental taxes. The City’s current tax systems have limited interfaces with each other or other systems of record (such as the accounting system), making the back-end data processing and reporting necessary for audit and enforcement ineffective compared to modern tools. The complicated network of applications and processes makes the safeguarding of taxpayer information and federal tax information a significant, costly undertaking for both the Division of Income Tax and the Department of Technology. Finally, the systems have not kept up with technical advances in providing a modern taxpayer interface, leaving Columbus taxpayers without a viable online option for filing returns, viewing account information, or making payments. Due to the lack of modern online options for taxpayers, a significant portion of the Division’s incoming filings are received via mail, making the collection of income tax revenues not only inconvenient for taxpayers, but also highly manual for the City.\nThe Auditor’s Office conducted an RFP process in accordance with Section 329.27 of Columbus City Code for a new fully-integrated revenue management system and related professional services necessary to implement the proposed system.\nFive (5) responses were received. The initial responses were evaluated using (1) quality and feasibility of the proposed project plan, (2) overall proposed system, (3) project resources and product efficiencies, (4) licensing model/ongoing maintenance support options, (5) cost and payment terms, and (6) ability, competence, and past performance of the offeror.\nAfter reviewing the proposals, two (2) offerors were selected to provide scripted virtual demonstrations for five (5) days each. Each vendor was permitted to revise their proposals and resubmit to account for COVID-19 restrictions and after having interviewed the City, any revisions needed for items such as scope, project plan, or cost. The committee re-reviewed the content of the proposals, the revisions and considered the presentation content, the references, and all other pertinent information collected during the due diligence phase. After the demonstrations were concluded, FAST Enterprises GenTax solution was recommended by the Evaluation Committee as the highest rated offeror to replace the City’s aged legacy systems.\nImplementing FAST Enterprises’ GenTax solution will allow the City of Columbus as an enterprise to achieve the following objectives:\n•                     Replace all tax processing systems with a single solution that meets the City’s needs for an integrated revenue management system.\n•                     Maintain a flexible and configurable revenue management system, requiring minimal customizations to accommodate current and future business rules, various tax and revenue types, scanning and other data acquisition methods, reporting requirements, and interfaces.\n•                     Allow taxpayers easy self-service access to their tax accounts to find the information and the filing capabilities they need to meet all of their tax requirements.\n•                     Streamline City workflow and case management processes.\n•                     Enhance safeguarding protections of confidential personal information and federal tax information.\n•                     Integrate third party data sources to more accurately identify non-compliance and enforce the collection of the City’s income tax.\n•                     Provide more reliable, real-time data to City leadership to better inform the decisions that impact the economic prosperity of our residents and businesses.\n•                     Enable the ability for the Division of Income Tax staff to work remotely and continue collection of essential revenues, which is not possible via the current legacy systems.\nFinally, this ordinance contains $2,490,000 in funding for contingencies that may arise in the project and allows the project manager to authorize change orders in the scope of work as needed to see the project to a successful conclusion. Contingencies budgeted for include the purchase of any necessary machines/equipment, network needs for data conversion, staff augmentation, and other unforeseen circumstances. Pricing for such contingency purchases will be obtained from state or other cooperative contracts, City UTC, standard published government discounts, or soliciting quotes from vendors qualified to provide the necessary items.\nIn order to ensure adequate resources and complete the project, the City Auditor requires the ability to contract with additional vendors to provide resources for staff augmentation. It is in the City's best interests to authorize the City Auditor to waive competitive bidding in order to enter into contracts with the following vendors as needed:\n•                     State of Ohio's IT Staff Augmentation Contract (state term schedule) with Knowledge Services or the current contract provider for any additional IT staff needed to assist in the deployment of the tax revenue system.\n•                     Additional vendors as may be necessary from the project contingency budget.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer $24,510,000.00 from the Special Income Tax Fund to the Auditor Bond Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to enter into contract with FAST Enterprises; to authorize the City Auditor to enter into contract with such additional vendors as may be necessary for a modern revenue management system; to waive the competitive bidding provisions to enter into such contracts; to provide funding for the implementation, support, hosting, and maintenance of GenTax Income Tax Revenue Management System; to authorize the appropriation  of $24,510,000.00 in the Auditor Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $27,000,000.00 in the Auditor Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency ($27,000,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; and\nWHEREAS, a transfer of $24,510,000 from the Special Income Tax Fund to the City Auditor Bond fund is necessary to fund the project; and\nWHEREAS, the City will sell notes or bonds to fund this project and will then reimburse the Special Income Tax Fund accordingly; and \nWHEREAS, this transfer should be considered a temporary funding method; and \nWHEREAS, the City anticipates incurring certain Original Expenditures (as defined in Section 1.150-2(c) of the Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) with respect to the construction of the project described in this ordinance (the “Project”). \nWHEREAS, the City Auditor and the Department of Technology have determined that the City's existing legacy income tax revenue management systems are no longer adequate and are reaching the end of their product life;\nWHEREAS, the City Auditor and her staff have conducted a search for and study of replacement options;\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus solicited Requests for Proposals (RFP) pursuant to Columbus City Code 329 for Professional Services for the purchase and implementation of an Income Tax Revenue Management System.

Pricing for such contingency purchases will be obtained from state or other cooperative contracts, City UTC, standard published government discounts, or soliciting quotes from vendors qualified to provide the necessary items; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the city's best interests to waive the competitive bidding provisions to enter into such contracts; and\nWHEREAS, additional resources and support services are necessary to complete the project; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Auditor's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Auditor to enter into contracts with FAST Enterprises and others for the implementation, necessary equipment and professional services related to the deployment of GenTax and related systems to replace the City's current income tax revenue management systems, thereby preserving the public health, peace, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
