    "description": "Title\nTo strongly oppose Issue 1 which, if passed at the August 8, 2023 special election, would require a 60% supermajority of Ohio voters to amend the state constitution and urge voters to vote NO.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, since 1912, Ohio law has required a simple majority of 50% plus one vote to approve an amendment to the Ohio constitution; and\n \nWHEREAS, this past May, Ohio lawmakers passed a joint resolution, by only a simple majority, to place a measure, now called Issue 1, on a special election ballot in August, making it more difficult to amend the Ohio constitution because Issue 1 would increase the approval threshold for state constitutional amendments from a simple majority of 50% plus one to a 60% supermajority; and\n \nWHEREAS, just last year, Ohio lawmakers passed HB 458 eliminating August special elections; now, however, lawmakers want to allow the upcoming August special election, hoping that minimal voter turnout will pass the 60% supermajority requirement; and\n \nWHEREAS, if passed in August, the new 60% supermajority requirement would go into effect before the November election, which lawmakers hope will hinder the potential passage of an expected ballot initiative to amend the Ohio constitution to protect reproductive rights and many other citizen-led initiatives that effect Ohioans’ daily lives; and\n \nWHEREAS, Issue 1 would undermine the sacred principle of one person one vote; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohioans have not abused the right to place constitutional amendments on the ballot, with just 71 citizen-initiated amendments on the ballot since 1913; and\n \nWHEREAS, the process to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot is already an onerous task, requiring the collection of hundreds of thousands of valid signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties; and\n \nWHEREAS, by including the need to collect a certain threshold of signatures from all 88 counties almost guarantee that only extremely wealthy out of state interests will be able to afford to try to amend our Ohio constitution; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio citizens use the constitutional amendment process to pass amendments without the legislature’s involvement; Issue 1 is a blatant effort by the legislature to sneak past Ohio voters an extreme measure that diminishes the power of Ohioans and subverts the will of the people of Ohio; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby strongly oppose Issue 1 which, if passed at the August 8, 2023 special election, would require a 60% supermajority of Ohio voters to amend the state’s constitution, thereby making it more difficult to amend the state constitution and, as a consequence, frustrating the prospects of passing future ballot issues. Further, Columbus City Council urges voters to vote NO on Issue 1 on August 8, 2023.",
