    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize and Celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the National African American Male Wellness Agency\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, In 2004, John and Pamela Gregory created the National African American Male Wellness Agency to begin the process of making men understand that, through prevention, one can live longer; and\nWHEREAS, throughout the past twenty years, the Agency has worked hard to close the inequitable gap between the life expectancies of white and African American men, as African American men are more likely to die from chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer than white men, and their life expectancy, on average, is lower; and\nWHEREAS, through charitable initiatives including providing thousands of free health screenings yearly and organizing the National African American Male Wellness Walk/Run Initiative, the National African American Male Wellness Agency has given tens of thousands of African American men new insight on their health and raised awareness of racial health disparities in the United States; and\nWHEREAS, the National African American Male Wellness Agency has expanded to engage men in sixteen different U.S. cities, including Washington, D.C., Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC, and Columbus, OH; and\nWHEREAS, the National African American Male Wellness Agency, recognizing that wellness is a holistic issue, has embraced an expanded perspective on health and wellness to include fatherhood, financial wellness, mental health, mentorship, and research initiatives; and\nWHEREAS, the National African American Male Wellness Agency is celebrating twenty years of positive change in the lives and well-being of African American men across the country; now, therefore\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council recognizes the 20th anniversary of the National African American Male Wellness Agency and thanks the Agency for its continued contributions to Columbus communities",
