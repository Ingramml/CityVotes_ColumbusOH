Additionally, in a letter from Crown Staffing Solutions, LLC dated June 9, 2023, it was validated that the company will serve as the GRANTEE’s employer of record.  As a result, the GRANTEE is requesting the AGREEMENT be amended to add the company’s third party employer Crown Staffing Solutions, LLC as an additional GRANTEE to the AGREEMENT. \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time to add Crown Staffing Solutions, LLC as an additional GRANTEE to the AGREEMENT.  \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the City of Columbus Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with Hollingsworth Logistics Group, LLC dba Hollingsworth, LLC and Hollingsworth Management Services, LLC for the purpose of adding Crown Staffing Solutions, LLC as an additional GRANTEE to the AGREEMENT.
