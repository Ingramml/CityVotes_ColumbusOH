    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation will authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, to enter into a sole source contract with NextGen Healthcare Information Systems for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical records system. The original agreement was authorized by ordinance 1489-2014, passed July 21, 2014. It was most recently renewed and authorized under the authority of ordinance 1693-2022, passed July 11, 2022. This ordinance authorizes continuing services for the term period of August 1, 2023 to July 31, 2024, at a cost of $380,782.05. \nThe Health Department initially used the NextGen system through Mount Carmel Health Systems. It was determined, however, that additional functionality was needed. As such, the Health Department contracted with NextGen directly in 2014. The hosted NextGen system enables the Columbus Public Health Department to operate five major clinical operations, which provide an extensive array of services. These services include patient registration, appointment scheduling, monitoring and tracking of patient test results, creation and processing of electronic medical records, and generation of reports to help manage clinic operations.\nThis ordinance also requests approval to enter into the above-mentioned contract agreement in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Section 329 of the Columbus City Codes, as it has been determined that NextGen is the sole provider of direct hosted NextGen systems and is the sole owner of NextGen software.\nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $380,782.05 for the above-described services.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract are available and budgeted in the Information Services Operating fund.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nNextGen Healthcare Information Systems, vendor # 006326\nEMERGENCY\nThis ordinance is being submitted with emergency designation. The current contract expires on July 31, 2023. To ensure a contract for the provision of the above described services is in place by the time the current contract expires, emergency action is necessary. A lapse in service would negatively affect critical patient services that are provided by the Health Department.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Columbus Public Health Department, to enter into a sole source contract with NextGen Healthcare Information Systems, LLC for hosting and ongoing support of an electronic medical record system, in accordance with sole source provisions in the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $380,782.05 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
