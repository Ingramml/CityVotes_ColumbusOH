($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is accepting applications to fund projects that address locations with a history of fatal or injury crashes where low-cost safety improvements have failed to solve the problem.  The Highway Safety Improvement Program accepts formal safety applications twice a year, on March 31 and August 31; and it accepts abbreviated safety applications four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.  These grants require a 10% local match.\n \nThis spring, ODOT added a second round of formal safety applications, with a deadline of March 31.  For this additional funding round, the Department of Public Service submitted an application seeking funds to construct safety improvements at the intersection of Roberts Road at Frazell Road/Spindler Road.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute project agreements for approved projects, to accept and expend grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications for the project listed below:\n \n538014-100000 - Intersection - Roberts Rd at Frazell Rd/Spindler Rd:  This project includes modifications to mitigate crashes at the closely spaced intersections of Frazell Road and Spindler Road with Roberts Road.   The improvement project includes a double roundabout design as well as pedestrian and bicyclist safety improvements in the form of shared use path and sidewalk.  This is a formal safety application, and the total project cost is approximately $5,713,500.00.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) accepts formal applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds on March 31 and August 31;
