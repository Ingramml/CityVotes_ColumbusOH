    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Korda/Nemeth Engineering to add additional funds for design of the Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Hilltop project.\nOrdinance No. 2617-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Korda/Nemeth Engineering for the Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Hilltop project.  The Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Hilltop project will install sidewalk along residential streets surrounding West High School, Highland Elementary School, and West Broad Elementary School.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $190,000.00.  The construction of this project will be funded with a grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).\n \nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover the cost of work due to additional stormwater analysis due to site constraints.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $800,000.00     (PO146176, Ord. 2617-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $190,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $990,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Korda/Nemeth Engineering.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Korda/Nemeth Engineering is CC004467 and expires 2/22/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $190,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align funding with the proper project. The amendment to the 2023 Capital budget is continent upon its passage.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project modifications to keep the design work, already under contract, moving forward without delay in order to meet the construction start date requirement associated with ODOT funds for the construction phase of the project, and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc., in connection with the Operation Sidewalks - School Sidewalks - Hilltop project; to authorize the expenditure in an amount not to exceed $190,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($190,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
