    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (\"USDOT\") issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (\"NOFO\") for approximately $1 billion in discretionary grant funding for FY 2023 through the Safe Streets for All (\"SS4A\") grant program. This is the second round of funding for the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (\"RAISE\") program.  The final NOFO was released on March 30, 2023 and remains open through July 10, 2023.\n \nThe purpose of SS4A grants is to improve roadway safety by significantly reducing or eliminating roadway fatalities and serious injuries through safety action plan development and implementation focused on all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation users, motorists, personal conveyance and micro-mobility users, and commercial vehicle operators. The program provides funding to develop the tools to help strengthen a community’s approach to roadway safety and save lives and is designed to meet the needs of diverse local, Tribal, and regional communities that differ dramatically in size, location, and experience administering Federal funding.  There are two types of funding: Planning and Demonstration Grants and Implementation Grants.  Applicants are permitted to request both types of funding in a single application\n \nThe City meets the eligibility criteria to submit a SS4A implementation grant application because the City’s Vision Zero Action Plan is a comprehensive safety action plan.  It is also eligible to request additional Planning and Demonstration funding to support activities that will inform and support planned action items in its Vision Zero Action Plan.  The Department of Public Service is currently working with community members and other stakeholders to develop a Bronzeville/Mt. Vernon Avenue Mobility and Safety Action Plan.  The Department is requesting SS4A funding for permanent infrastructure improvements, as well as for demonstration projects to test the feasibility of future infrastructure improvements and support other action items in the Vision Zero Action Plan.  The Department estimates the total cost of the implementation and demonstration projects to be approximately $8,173,406.00.  It anticipates requesting approximately $6,538,724.00 in SS4A funding from the USDOT. The City anticipates it will receive approximately 80% of the funding for the safety improvements and demonstration activities.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a SS4A Implementation Grant, execute agreements with USDOT or others in connection with the award of the grant, expend the grant funds, and return unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nRAISE grants may be used for up to eighty percent (80%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with an application prior to the deadline of July 10, 2023. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a Safe Streets for All (SS4A) Program Implementation Grant from the United States Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of the grant and other requisite agreements for the acceptance and administration of said grant; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (\"USDOT\") announced the second round of funding for the Safe Streets for All (\"SS4A\") Grant Program, which is a grant program awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, the purpose of SS4A grants is to improve roadway safety by significantly reducing or eliminating roadway fatalities and serious injuries through safety action plan development and implementation focused on all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation users, motorists, personal conveyance and micro-mobility users, and commercial vehicle operators.
