    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with CK Construction Group for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project. The contract amount being authorized by this ordinance is $29,475.00. \n \nKilbourne Run Sports Park, located at 4625 Westerville Road, is a soccer specific facility that stretches over 62 acres with 35 of those acres dedicated to athletic space. The park currently contains 16 fields of various sizes, gravel parking lots, an existing shelter, a two story vacant commercial building, as well as, a building used for concessions and storage. Recreation and Parks is updating Kilbourne Run Sports Park to include prime fields and facilities that will increase access to soccer and other field sports for the Columbus Community. This will position Columbus as a destination for regional tournaments. The Recreation and Parks Department previously entered into contract with DLZ Ohio to complete design services and to aid the Department in project delivery. Design will continue through early summer of 2024 and it is the intent that the improved Kilbourne Run Sports Park is open in the spring of 2025.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department proposes to deliver this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) Contract. This delivery method will save the City money and time compared to a traditional delivery in this labor short market. We are proposing to begin the pre-construction services part of the contract to help the Department identify the best value materials and designs to deliver the project on schedule and on budget.  \n \nCMAR is a “best value” selection in lieu of a “low bid” selection associated with traditional project deliveries. During a “best value” selection, a vendor’s qualifications are evaluated and weighted as part of a total score.  Costs, including project overhead, profit, and contingencies are evaluated, weighted, and scored. The vendor with the highest combined score represents the “best value”.  During this selection process, CK Construction Group represented the “best value”.\n \nThis $29,475.00 fee is the first of two authorizations that will ultimately fund the construction of this facility. Recreation and Parks will negotiate a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the project delivery once the CMAR is under construction and construction plans are in final design. The future request will include total GMP authorization, which our CMAR cannot exceed. The anticipated budget for construction is estimated to be approximately 18 million dollars. The Recreation and Parks Department is currently pursuing a construction start date in 2024 and hopes to open the park to the public in the spring of 2025.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on April 7, 2023 and initial responses were received by the Recreation and Parks Department on May 11, 2023. Following the receipt and evaluation of initial proposals and qualifications by the Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) selection committee, three vendors were provided a request for technical proposals and costs. Initial proposals were received from the following vendors:\n \nCK Construction Group (MAJ)\nElford (MAJ)\nRuhlin Company (MAJ)\nRuscilli Construction (MAJ)\nSetterlin Building (MAJ)\nSmoot Construction (MBE)\n \nAfter the initial proposals were evaluated by the committee, CK Construction Group, Ruscilli Construction Company, and Smoot Construction were the vendors that the subsequent technical proposals were requested from. In accordance with City Code, a selection team evaluated the proposals and recommended CK Construction Group be selected to perform the work. The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, project approach, and proposed fees.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCK Construction Group\n6245 Westerville Road\nWesterville, Ohio 43081\nJames Negron, (614) 901-8844\nContract Compliance Number: 006875 \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 9, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to keep the project on schedule, allowing the park to open to the public in the spring of 2025 and to avoid escalation of construction materials costs due to supply chain issues. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the soccer amenities and outdoor sports programs the City can offer to the public. Additionally, these improvements set the City of Columbus up to be a major destination for soccer programs and tournaments for all levels of play.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Input for this project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports, and Leisure International (CSL) and managed by the Recreation and Parks Department in the summer of 2021.
