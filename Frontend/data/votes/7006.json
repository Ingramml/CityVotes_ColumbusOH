The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $13,600.00.\n \nIn 2007, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department acquired 110 acres of former farmland on the City's east side, near the Village of Galloway. The property is located within the Big Darby Tier One Environmental Preservation area. It is considered a key preservation site for the watershed on the boundary of Columbus and the Big Darby Creek. As part of the acquisition, 25 acres of land was set aside for a future neighborhood park for Columbus residents in the Laurel Greene and Southwest Airport neighborhoods. \n \nThis design contract for Alkire Road Park includes producing all bidding and construction documents necessary to build out phase 1 of the master plan for Alkire Park. Phase 1 includes site earthwork, demolition, utilities, hardscapes, structures, landscaping, playground improvements, and site furnishings.  \n \nA modification for this contract is needed to complete the detailed design phase and furnish complete construction documents for bidding due to the unanticipated permitting requirements from Franklin County and Prairie Township, causing the need to increase the consultant's contract amount.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGlaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns, and Dehaven DBA GPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                     \nJeff Evans, PE, 614-210-0751                                                                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 006560\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 24, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure that the design is completed by fall 2023 so that construction stays on schedule, minimizing the impact of supply chain issues and escalation of costs for the project.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Alkire Park will be a significant greenspace for the Westland Community. The scale of park will allow for direct neighborhood connections to preserved prairie land, open space, a new playground, and the Camp Chase Greenway Trail.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Westland Area Commission has been advocating for the development of Alkire Park for several years. Input has been gathered during the master planning and programming phases of Alkire Park development with Westland Area Commission, the Darby Accord Advisory Group, and Prairie Township.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Westland (52)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks, trails, and easy connectivity for Columbus residents of all ages. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $116,998.00 was legislated for the Alkire Park Improvements - Phase 1 Design Project by Ordinance 2038-2021. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $13,600.00. $13,600.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
