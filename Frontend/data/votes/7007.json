    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with MS Consultants for continued professional services associated with the Hoover Reservoir Amenities 2022 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $35,000.00.\n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department solicited requests for proposals for providing professional engineering services for three sites at Hoover Reservoir and this project will provide improvements at three separate locations. The first site, on the north end of the reservoir, will replace an existing boardwalk that is currently closed due to safety concerns. At the second site, work will be performed on the boat ramps and docks located on the west bank of the reservoir at the intersection of Walnut Street and Sunbury Road. The third site, located just north of the boat ramps, is where a proposed ADA accessible fishing pier will be constructed.  \n \nHoover Reservoir provides countless recreational opportunities to hundreds of thousands Columbus residents per year, including birding, hiking, boating, kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and more. On the north end of the reservoir, the boardwalk was originally constructed in 2006 and has undergone significant maintenance during its 16 year lifespan. Due to current safety concerns, the boardwalk has been closed to users since 2019. An engineering assessment of the boardwalk was completed in 2021 identifying structural and other significant safety concerns. The Recreation and Parks Department is proposing to replace the current boardwalk with a more sustainable design to provide a unique and safe amenity to all residents. Construction is anticipated to start in the fall and winter of 2024 and 2025, taking advantage of the period of time when water levels in the reservoir are the lowest.\n \nIn addition to the original contract that is outlined above, the City of Columbus Division of Water is anticipating a project, with a project budget of approximately $400,000.00, for parking lot pavement and reservoir shoreline stabilization improvements at the Walnut Street Launch Ramp. Due to this, the Division of Water and the Recreation and Parks Department wish to collaborate on these projects at the same location and the Division of Water is funding this contract modification. The Division of Water managed pavement improvements contribution will be limited to milling, resurfacing, and striping the existing asphalt drives and parking area. Up to approximately 150 to 225 feet of shoreline north of the existing concrete launch ramp is also proposed to be armored using rock channel protection. The Recreation and Parks Department’s project manager will manage this modification concurrently with the original project. When the project was initially scoped and priced, the Recreation and Parks Department was unaware that the Division of Water had these needs in this parking lot. The fees established were determined by using established hourly rates in the current contract. A separate authorization for these services would have caused unnecessary confusion and coordination between vendors simultaneously working at the same site.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMS Consultants, Inc.\n2221 Schrock Road \nColumbus, Ohio 43229\nKen Ricker, PE, Project Manager, (614) 898-7100                                                                \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 006998\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: December 28, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the boardwalk is closed due to structural and safety issues that exist and it is the goal of the department to remove hazardous infrastructure as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is critical, from a financial perspective, to be prepared to start construction while the water in the reservoir is at its lowest level during the fall and winter.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Hoover Reservoir provides countless recreational opportunities to hundreds of thousands Columbus residents per year, including birding, hiking, boating, kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and more.  Hoover Nature Preserve is over 925 acres and provides access to a 1,500 foot boardwalk at Hoover Reservoir. As a migratory stop-over for more than 33 species of shorebirds, this is an important natural asset for the community. The three amenities included in this project will provide additional opportunities to experience the reservoir and will also promote ADA accessibility.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Multiple concerned citizens have reached out to the City of Columbus as it relates to accessibility these facilities and to provide more areas for fishing. A common complaint is that fishing is not allowed from any of the dock walkways attached to the boat ramps and this project will help alleviate these concerns by providing a fishing pier. During the development of this project, the community will be engaged and input will be gathered to determine the qualities of the boardwalk, ramps, and docks.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by promoting upgrades to infrastructure, as well as, the use of blueways and access to natural areas. In addition, this project provides improved access for different types of watercraft, fishing, and wildlife viewing. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $840,415.46 was legislated for the Hoover Reservoir Amenities 2022 Project by Ordinance 3519-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $35,000.00. $35,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Water General Obligation Bond Fund 6006 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $875,415.46. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with MS Consultants for continued professional services associated with the Hoover Reservoir Amenities 2022 Project; to authorize the expenditure of $35,000.00 from the Water General Obligation Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
