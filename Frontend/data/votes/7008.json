    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten education for every 4-year-old.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nChildren who participate in high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills.  Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate. \n \nThrough Early Start Columbus, the Office of Education provides high-quality pre-kindergarten services to children throughout the City.  However, data provided by Future Ready Columbus, an education-focused public-private partnership, shows that kindergarten readiness scores in the Linden and Whitehall communities are lower than scores county-wide.  Therefore the Office of Education plans to focus summer programming on those areas.\n \nThis contract will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Section 329.30.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $298,000.00 from the 2023 Office of Education’s General Fund operating budget.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is requested so programming may begin during the summer months.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract with Family, Adolescent and Child Community Engagement Services (FACCES), a non-profit organization that specializes in family engagement with a focus on academic navigation through their K-Ready Ohio program; to focus specifically in preparing children in Linden and Whitehall for kindergarten; to authorize the expenditure of $298,000.00 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency. ($298,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, kindergarten readiness is essential for the success of children in school, and in life; and \n \nWHEREAS, data shows that the kindergarten readiness scores of children in the Linden and Whitehall communities are the lowest, county-wide; and   \n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Education desires to enter into a contract with Family, Adolescent and Child Community Engagement Services (FACCES) to provide a parent curriculum that supports the family and early learning childcare centers in collecting data and KRA scores; and \n \nWHEREAS, the goal is that all children in the City of Columbus will be kindergarten ready; and \n \nWHEREAS, funding was budgeted in the general fund within the Office of Education’s operating budget for this purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, this contract is being awarded to the FACCES pursuant to Section 329.30, for which the City does not supply such services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Mayor’s Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with FACCES so programming may begin as soon as possible during the summer months, all for the preservation of public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
