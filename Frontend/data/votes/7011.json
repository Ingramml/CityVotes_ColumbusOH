The General Engineering Consultant Services (GEC) #4 Project is necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU).  \n \nGeneral Engineering Consultant (GEC) Services are necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). Initial services are for Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) facilities. Additional DPU facilities may be added in the future.   The GEC services may include the following tasks for small projects: investigations, inspections and evaluations of existing conditions, surveying, preparation of engineering or architectural drawings and specifications, review of contractors’ submittals including shop drawings, maintenance and operation (M&O) manuals, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  The GEC services may also include assistance with new equipment or systems start-up and commissioning, instrumentation & control (I&C) work such as Human Machine Interface (HMI) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming, uploading documents onto the City’s Project Management Information System (PMIS), computerized maintenance software, preparation of record plan drawings for small projects, technical assistance in the preparation of Facilities/Equipment Maintenance (FEM) documents, and other similar related tasks. Small projects that may, on occasion, require engineering services under this contract include small Capital Improvement Projects (formerly known as “Plant Improvement Projects” or “PIPs”) and FEM service contracts.\n \nThe small Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) will vary in nature and can include replacement and upgrade of equipment, materials, structural features,  electrical, or instrumentation & control (I&C) work and their associated appurtenances that have served its useful life.\n \nThe actual construction and commissioning of upgrades in the several facilities will generally be accomplished by others.\n \nPlanning Area: 99 - Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended: $500,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract Amount                                           $425,000.00\nRenewal #1                                                                                    $500,000.00\nRenewal #2                                                                  $500,000.00\nRenewal #3 (Current)                                                       $500,000.00\nCurrent Total                                                                      $1,925,000.00\n \n1.2.

THE PROJECT TIMELINE: The contract duration is for four (4) years, starting upon the date of Contract Execution (January 21, 2020). The professional services shall be funded by incremental appropriation, through the use of approximately annual modifications. This is the final planned renewal for this project. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\n31-0885550 | MAJ | Exp. 2/9/2024 | Vendor # 004425.
