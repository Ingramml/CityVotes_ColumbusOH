($300,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract renewal for professional engineering services during construction with Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc. for the DOSD Stormwater Pump Stations Evaluation & Upgrade Program, CIP 611660-100000, in an amount up to $300,000.00 for Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nThis project provides for a holistic evaluation of each pump station, assess their structural, mechanical, process, electrical, and I&C components, identify needs and improvements, and identify risks and safety issues. The evaluation and assessments for each pump station will be summarized into a Technical Memorandum (TM). The recommended improvements listed in the Technical Memorandums will be refined into Improvement Plans that will be used by the City to systematically upgrade the pump stations.\n \nHatch began their work after Notice to Proceed (NTP) was given on 1/24/22. The duration of the engineering agreement is expected to be three (3) years. The professional services shall be funded by incremental appropriation, through the use of approximately annual renewals. This is the first of two (2) planned renewals. The second renewal is planned for April 2024.\n \nDOSD Stormwater Pump Stations Evaluation & Upgrade Program serves multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $300,000.00\nCost summary: \n                     Original Engineering Agreement (ORD.3129-2021; PO308529)                                              $300,000.00\n                     Renewal No. 1 (current)                                                                                                                                                              $300,000.00\n                     Renewal No. 2 (future)                                                                                                                                                                       $300,000.00\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                                                       $900,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe funding provided by this contract renewal is for the continuation of existing and planned work of the project. Due to the highly complex and technical nature of this project, it is not reasonable or cost effective to undertake a new procurement to acquire these services. The lengthy process for initiating a new procurement and for a new entity to gain understanding of the project would cause an unacceptable project delay and additional cost.\n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe cost of the renewal was determined through negotiations with Hatch Associates. The tasks for this Renewal are similar to the tasks of the Original Agreement; so, the costs of this Renewal are similar to the Original Agreement.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe performance of this projects’ activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate and provide recommendations for the upgrade of DOSD’s Stormwater Pump Stations is needed to plan improvements to maintain peak operational performance. If left unperformed, the required work could become larger in scope and more expensive and could produce a major impact to the sewer collection systems and the budget. No community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nHatch Associates Consultants, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC025646 and expires 03/08/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc.\n \n4.
