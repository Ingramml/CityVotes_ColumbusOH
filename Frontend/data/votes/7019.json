    "description": "Explanation                     \n \nBACKGROUND:  The purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities modify to extend the contract and to increase funding to an indefinite quantity contract with Watershed Organic Lawn Care for the Green Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance Project. The City of Columbus is committed to investing in green infrastructure. As part of this commitment, the City has built a number of bio-retention basins in the right-of-way and/or on City owned property.    \n \nA bioretention basin consists of a soil bed planted with vegetation located above a gravel layer with an underdrain. Stormwater runoff entering the bioretention facility is filtered first through the vegetation and then the soil bed before being conveyed downstream through the underdrain system, slowing the runoff velocity and treating stormwater runoff by absorption, decomposition, and filtration. Bioretention facilities are often sited adjacent to and used to treat runoff from paved surfaces such as parking lots. \n \nBioretention basins improve water quality through: soil and media filtration, stormwater detention, natural evapotranspiration, and biological uptake of water and nutrients. Stormwater can be conveyed to bioretention facilities via sheet flow, channelization, curb cuts, inlets or conveyance systems.\n \nThe City is currently responsible for the maintenance of 14 Facilities with 55 basins/wetlands and 24 swales in Group 1- Water and Regional Basins. These facilities are located at Idlewild Drive, Griggs Reservoir, O’Shaughnessy Reservoir, Hoover Reservoir, Dublin Road Water Plant, 910 Dublin Road Landscape, Briggs Road Detention, Crawford Farms Stormwater Retrofit, Mound Street Booster Station, Smokey Row Booster Station, and Joyce Avenue. Each facility and location may have multiple sites with basins, swales, or other types of green infrastructure. Additional facilities may be added in the future.  \n \nThe City is currently responsible for the maintenance of 11 facilities with 436 basins in Group 2- Urban Basins Type A.
