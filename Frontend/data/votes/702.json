    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with Black and Veatch Corporation for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Intake Structure and Low Head Dam Rehabilitation Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690511-100000, Division of Water Contract No. 2086.\n \nThe overall agreement will provide professional engineering services for said project.  \n \nWork performed to date includes:\n•                     Step  1 - Condition Assessment & Preliminary Design (initial contract)\n•                     Step  2 - Detailed Design and Construction Bidding Services (renewal #1)\n \nRenewal No. 2 (current) is for Step 3 - Engineering Services During Construction.  \n \nPlanning Area: The dam and intake are integral elements of the treatment process and the Hap Cremean Water Plant serves multiple planning areas so the project planning area is “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,589,300.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                         $   336,750.00   (PO097719)\nRenewal #1:                     $1,471,800.00    (PO161007)\nRenewal #2 (current)                     $1,589,300.00\nTotal (Orig. + Rens. 1-2):                     $3,397,850.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nStep 3 services were included in the RFP advertisement for which the Division received proposals in May 2017 from three interested firms.  The current consultant has since gained detailed knowledge of the site and existing facilities, and has completed the detailed design / construction documents.  Awarding this work to a new consultant would require duplication of some of the condition assessment and design work already performed, increasing project costs and extending the project schedule.\n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nBlack & Veatch and the City developed a scope of work for the Step 3 services based on the nature and estimated duration of the construction and the City’s needs.  B&V then developed the estimated level of effort / fee to perform the agreed to scope.  The scope and fee were reviewed by the City PM and B&V refined these based on City’s comments.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This project will address aging infrastructure associated with processes that are necessary for adequate drinking water supply and treatment.  These systems have experienced structural and operational issues in the past and many components are past their useful life.  The HCWP is an essential and integral component in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water is essential to economic growth and development.  Public informational meetings are not anticipated for this project, all proposed work should be within the boundaries of the water treatment facility.  Regulatory agencies will be notified of the proposed work as appropriate.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  43-1833073, expires 9/12/21, MAJ, DAX No. 8038\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Black and Veatch Corporation.\n \n4. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Regulatory coordination/permit acquisition and work required to coordinate this project with other upcoming construction contracts occurring at the same site meant that this scope/fee could not be finalized as early as originally planned.  Emergency legislation is needed to keep these step 3 services on schedule with the corresponding construction contract legislation so that engineering services during construction are available at the construction Notice to Proceed.  \n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT: A transfer of funds within the Water G.O. Bonds Fund will be necessary as well as an amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew the professional engineering services agreement with Black and Veatch Corporation for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Intake Structure and Low Head Dam Rehabilitation Project for the Division of Water; to authorize a transfer and expenditure up to $1,589,300.00 within the Water General Obligations Bond Fund; to amend the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; and to declare an emergency.
