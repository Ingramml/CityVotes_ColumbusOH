    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate funds to support the work of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission for the purpose of fulfilling the Commission’s community education duties outlined in Chapter 377 of Columbus City Code.\n \nBecause labor law enforcement is complaint driven, it is essential that workers know their rights and the pathways to secure those rights. Unfortunately, the workers most vulnerable to wage theft often do not know where to turn when their rights are violated. The Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission has a codified responsibility to ensure that residents are aware of their workplace rights under federal, state, and local law.\n \nThis ordinance provides the funding necessary for the Commission to begin to carry out this work on a public level, including identifying partners to further their reach and the development of educational materials informing residents of their rights.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an appropriation within the Job Growth subfund for various expenditures for materials, equipment, and professional services related to the community education duties of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission is charged with community education regarding worker rights in Chapter 377 of Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission seeks to provide printed materials, digital infrastructure, and perform outreach directly to Columbus residents to promote worker rights and eliminate wage theft; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $50,000.00 in the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015, to Finance and Management per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
