    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to establish a not for profit grant agreement with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, to provide community based peer-to-peer education program for teens in Franklin County. Funding was awarded to CelebrateOne by the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services with Ordinance 0473-2023.\n \nIn addition to having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation, Ohio ranks 23rd out of all 50 states for teenage pregnancies. Teen pregnancy is a significant contributor to pre-maturity, a leading cause of infant mortality, because pregnant teens have a higher risk for having a baby born too small or too soon.\n \nA recent examination of the National Survey of Family Growth revealed that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50% less likely to report a pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education. Currently, without any state health education standards, many teens in Ohio and Franklin County do not have access to comprehensive, medically-accurate sex education.\n \nThe Office of CelebrateOne, in partnership with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, reinforces peer education by engaging youth in Columbus City Schools from the CelebrateOne neighborhoods. Peer education supports the development of healthy lifestyles and responsible choices by adolescents. Peer educators will receive training and incentives to increase their knowledge of essential, evidence-based sexual health information, establish important leadership skills, and gain the confidence to engage their peers and larger community in vital conversations.​\n \n \nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Ohio is a Not-For-Profit Organization, Tax ID # 34-1015976, DAX# 027518.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This not for profit grant agreement utilizes a $150,000.00 reimbursement grant from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services originally accepted by Ord. 0473-2023, Grant # G402301 Franklin County Board of Commissioners TANF Services.
