Our primary purpose is to continue collaboration of a coordinated advisory council of local response agencies and provide them with situation awareness for biological threats and hazards.  Additionally, we manage and promote bioterrorism preparedness throughout the cities of Columbus & Worthington and Franklin County.\n  \nEmergency action is requested in order to meet deliverables of the grant and not delay any exercise and training service programming from June 1, 2023 to May 31, 2024, and to avoid forfeiture of the grant. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Columbus Public Health's Biowatch program will not generate revenue or require a city match.  ($30,000.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept Biowatch grant funds from Ohio EPA in the amount of $30,000.00; to authorize the appropriation of $30,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
