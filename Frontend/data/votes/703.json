    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.0 BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kokosing Industrial, Inc. for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Intake Structure & Low Head Dam Improvements Project in an amount up to $11,103,250.00; to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00; for Capital Improvements Project No. 690511-100000, Division of Water Contract Number 2086.\n \nThis project will provide improvements to the existing Hap Cremean Water Plant intake structure and low head dam including: demolition and reconfiguration of the screening channels, new mechanical screening equipment, electrical systems as required for the improvements, heating and ventilation, plumbing, and instrumentation and controls; low head dam concrete repairs; creek dredging; creek bank stabilization; raw water conduit repairs; other associated site work; and all other such work as may be necessary to complete the Contract in accordance with the drawings, technical specifications, and City of Columbus Construction and Material Specifications as set forth in the Invitation For Bid (IFB).\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide since the HCWP services several Columbus communities.\n \n2.0 ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  This project will address aging infrastructure associated with the HCWP’s low head dam and intake structure.  The facilities have experienced structural and operational issues in the past due to normal wear and age related deterioration and many components are past their useful life.  The HCWP is an essential and integral component in the Columbus area water supply.  An adequate supply of safe water is essential to economic growth and development of the central Ohio area.  Public informational meetings are not anticipated for this project, all proposed work should be within the boundaries of the water treatment facility.  Regulatory agencies will be notified of the proposed work as appropriate.\n \n3.0 CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD:  The Director of Public Utilities publicly opened two (2) bids on March 18, 2021 from:  Kokosing Industrial, Inc. and Bowen Engineering Corporation.  \n \nThe second lowest bid, from Bowen Engineering Corporation, was deemed non-responsive for submitting a non-prequalified licensed subcontractor.\n \nKokosing’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $11,103,250.00.  Their Contract Compliance Number is 47-2946608 (expires 6/12/21, Majority) and their DAX Vendor No. is 12309.  Additional information regarding both bidders, description of work, contract time frame and detailed amounts can be found on the attached Information form.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Kokosing Industrial, Inc. \n \n3.1 PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS: Kokosing Industrial, Inc. and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \n4.0  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Regulatory coordination / permit acquisition work was extensive and took longer than anticipated.  Emergency legislation is needed to maintain the planned construction Notice to Proceed date, which is required to keep the construction work aligned with seasonal water plant production requirements and seasonal creek flow considerations that impact work within the creek.  \n \n5.0 FISCAL IMPACT:  This Ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Water System Reserve Fund - Fund No. 6003 to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund - Fund No. 6011, in order to fund this proposed expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the Division is able to execute a loan with the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund and reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in May 2021.  \n \nA portion of funding will also come from the Water G.O. Voted Bonds Fund - Fund No. 6006 and has sufficient funding and budgetary authority.\n \nAn amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget will be necessary in the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund - Fund No. 6011.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kokosing Industrial, Inc. for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Intake Structure & Low Head Dam Improvements Project in an amount up to $11,103,250.00; to encumber $2,000.00 for prevailing wage services provided by the Department of Public Service; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of $11,103,250.00 from the Water System Reserve Fund to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $11,103,250.00 within the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund; to authorize an expenditure up to $2,000.00 within the Water General Obligations Voted Bond Fund; for the Division of Water; to authorize an amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; and to declare an emergency.
