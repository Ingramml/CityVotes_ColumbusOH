    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production has issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for approximately $9.5 million in discretionary grant funding for FY 2023 through its Composting and Food Waste Reduction (CFWR) cooperative agreement pilot program.  USDA anticipates making awards between $55,000 and $400,000.  The NOFO was released on March 16, 2023 and remains open through June 15, 2023.\n \nThe CFWR cooperative agreement pilot program was funded through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.  The purpose of the CFWR program is to enter into cooperative agreements with eligible entities to develop and test strategies for planning and implementing municipal compost plans and food waste reduction plans. Proposed projects should address either food waste reduction and/or composting and conservation.  USDA will prioritize proposals that (1) align project proposals to address priorities on environmental justice, racial equity, climate change, investment in historically underserved communities, and sustainable agricultural practices; (2) integrate food waste reduction strategies that take into consideration the most preferred food waste recovery activities as described in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Food Recovery Hierarchy; (3) anticipate or demonstrate economic benefits for the impacted community; (4) incorporate plans to make compost easily accessible to agricultural producers, including community gardeners, school gardens, and producers; (5) include a robust plan that describes collaboration with multiple partners; and (6) provide a detailed plan for project monitoring, evaluation and documentation of insights and solutions to obstacles encountered during the course of the project.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application.  The Department of Public Service is requesting $400,000 in CFWR funding to support a residential curbside food waste pilot.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for a CWFR cooperative agreement pilot project grant, execute agreements with USEPA or others in connection with the award of the grant, expend grant funds awarded, and return unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to apply for grant funding from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Composting and Food Waste Reduction cooperative agreement pilot program; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Agriculture and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds; and to refund any unused grant funds.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a round of funding for the Composting and Food Waste Reduction (CFWR) cooperative agreement pilot program, which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDA is accepting applications for the FY 2023 funding round through June 15, 2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City is currently developing a residential curbside food waste program; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from USDA’s Composting and Food Waste Reduction (CFWR) cooperative agreement pilot program.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to accept said grants, if awarded, and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 4.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
