This legislation also seeks to appropriate the grant funds, authorize the expenditure of the grant funds, and execute a contract modification with Paul Werth Associates, Inc.\n \nThe Department of Public Service seeks authorization to execute documents necessary to accept a grant from The Recycling Partnership, Inc. This legislation also authorizes the Director of Public Service to administer the grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award and to refund any unused funds after the grant period ends if the final accounting determines a refund is owed. The grant provides $1 per household in direct funding for recycling education and outreach efforts regarding the Refuse Divisions' transition to weekly recycling. The grant also provides technical assistance in designing and creating educational materials.  \n \nThis legislation also authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional service contract with Paul Werth Associates, Inc., to add additional funds for the Residential Recycling Communication and Outreach project. With the acceptance of the aforementioned grant the Refuse Division requests authority to utilize these grant funds to perform communications and outreach related to the deployment of a weekly recycling program. The additional funds will be used for recycling education on digital platforms, social media and traditional media to create a layered messaging campaign that focuses on increasing recycling participation, reducing litter, and raising awareness of the reduction goals set by our city’s Climate Action Plan. \n \nThe original contract amount:                                         $ 250,000.00     (Ord. 1330-2023) \nModification No. 1                                                                               $ 230,879.00     (This ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:          $ 480,879.00  \n \nThe original contract with Paul Werth Associates, Inc., resulted from a request for proposal formally advertised on vendor service and Bonfire websites from March 23, 2023 to April 13, 2023.
