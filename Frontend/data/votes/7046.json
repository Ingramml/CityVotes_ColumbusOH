Additionally, this contract will construct new sidewalk and replace existing sidewalk in poor condition to fill gaps in the sidewalk network and complete compliant PARS and other work as may be necessary to complete the contract in accordance with the plans and specifications set forth in the Bid Submittal Documents.\n \nThe Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program provides annual grants on a formula basis to entitled cities and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons. Ordinance 3353-2022 established the appropriation of the CDBG Funds to specific projects within the City. A portion of these appropriations will be transferred to this project in order to fund this project.\n \nThe estimated Notice to Proceed date is July 10, 2023.  The project was let by the Office of Support Services through Vendor Services and Bid Express.  One bid was received on May 23, 2023, (majority) and tabulated as follows:   \n      \nCompany Name                                 Bid Amount               City/State                                                Majority/ODI      \nDecker Construction Company                         $2,020,551.15                     Columbus, OH                     Majority\n \nAward is to be made to Decker Construction Company as the lowest responsive and responsible and best bidder for their bid of $2,020,551.15.  The amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $303,082.67.  The total legislated amount is $2,323,633.82. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Decker Construction Company.\n \nAs part of their bid Decker Construction Company has proposed the following subcontractors to work on the project:\n \nCompany Name                                                  City/State                                                               Majority/ODI Certification      \nDanbert Electrical                                                               Plain City, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ                     \nPaul Peterson Company                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ                     \nGriffin Pavement Striping                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ                     \nMid-West Landscape, Inc.                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nBurley Trucking, LLC                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\n \n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Decker Construction Company is CC004549 and expires 12/2/2023.\n \n3. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nDecker Construction Company and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nA reimbursable grant in the Community Development Act Fund, Fund 2248, provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in the amount of $2,020,551.15 will fund a portion of the construction for this project. A transfer of $1,706,310.44 within Fund 2248 and transfer of $314,240.71 from Fund 2249, Economic Dev Revolving Loan Fund, is necessary to align cash with the proper project.  Funds will need to be appropriated.\n \nThe remaining balance in the amount of $303,082.67, is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of cash is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n5. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 6.08% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested because all CDBG funds must be spent and paid by mid-October to meet the HUD timeliness test; if the timeline test fails, the City is subject to a reduction in funding for future years; emergency passage will ensure the maximum amount of time to complete the work. \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement budget; to appropriate funds within the Economic Dev Revolving Loan Fund and the Community Development Act Fund; to authorize the transfer of funds between the Economic Dev Revolving Loan Fund and Community Development Act Fund; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with Decker Construction Company for the ADA Ramp Projects - CDBG Curb Ramps 2023 program; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $2,323,633.82 from the Streets and Highways Bonds Fund and from the Community Development Act Fund for the project; to repay any unused grant funds at the end of the grant period; and to declare an emergency.
