    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department modify an existing contract with DLZ Ohio to provide architectural and engineering services for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $2,757,447.12.\n \nKilbourne Run Sports Park, located at 4625 Westerville Road, is a soccer-specific facility that stretches over 62 acres. 35 of these acres are dedicated to athletic field space. The park currently contains 16 fields of various sizes, gravel parking lots, an existing shelter, a two story vacant commercial building, as well as a building used for concessions and storage. Over 81,000 residents live within a 10 minute drive from the park.\n \nColumbus Recreation and Parks acquired this soccer complex in 2014 and acquired an adjacent seven acre parcel, with frontage along Westerville Road, in 2017. The sports park has become one of the Columbus’ busiest soccer facilities with over 38,000 youth and adult participants on average per year. While some improvements have been completed, the sports park remains mostly in its original layout. This project is seeking to renovate this park into one of the most premier sports parks in the region. Columbus Recreation and Parks is proposing to redesign Kilbourne Run Sports Park to deliver highly maintained prime fields and facilities that will increase access to soccer and other field sports for the Columbus Community. These improvements will also position Columbus and this location as a destination for regional tournaments.\n \nBy modifying this contract, DLZ Ohio will be able to complete the design and construction documents for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Projects. This modification was planned during initial project scoping with the consultant. The portion of the project under Stage 2 will include detailed design and bidding support. There will be another planned modification for this contract in 2024 to cover Stage 3 which will include construction administration services.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDLZ Ohio, Inc.\n6121 Huntley Road \nColumbus, Ohio 43229\nBob Kirkley, (614) 888-0040\nContract Compliance Number: 004939\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: October 24, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to complete the detailed design plans which will coincide with the Construction Manager at Risk portion of this project and is critical to keep the project on schedule to open to the public in the spring of 2025.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the soccer amenities and programs the City can offer to the public. Additionally, these improvements set up the City of Columbus to be a major destination for soccer programs and tournaments for all levels of play, from recreational to professional.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Input for this improvement project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports, and Leisure International (CSL) and managed by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department in summer of 2021. Input was also gathered from internal Columbus Recreation and Parks Department stakeholders and the Mayor’s Office.   \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northland (35)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to update sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $677,109.00 was legislated for the design phase of the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project by Ordinance 3020-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $2,757,447.12. $2,757,447.12 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 and 7712 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
