    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. for the PAWP Hypochlorite Disinfection Improvements, CIP #690487-100000, in an amount up to $1,747,700.00 for Division of Water Contract No. 2133.\n \nThis project provides for engineering design and construction of improvements to the disinfection storage and feed facilities at the Parsons Avenue Water Plant. The Plant currently utilizes a chlorine gas based process and this project will convert the Plant to a liquid sodium hypochlorite based process.  Constructing new facility and retrofitting existing facilities for storage and feed of an alternate disinfectant will provide for safer storage and handling.  \n \nThe original agreement provided preliminary design services.  Renewal No. 1 (current) provided detailed design and bidding services.  This Modification #2 provides for Engineering Services During Construction.  \nEngineering Services During Construction will be completed in two parts as part of this contract renewal and shall provide clarification of contract documents for construction as required. \n \nThe Parson Avenue Water Plant serves multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,747,700.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                           $589,800.00                     (Ord. 2896-2016PO050804)\nRenewal #1 Amount:                                              $1,632,200.00  (Ord. 2956-2019PO209640)\nModification #2 (current):                                            $1,747,700.00  \nFinal Services During Construction, Pt 2 (Future)                                $1,000,000.00 (Estimate) \nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):                                              $4,969,700.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the preliminary design work to date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project and delay the timeline for replacing the existing chlorine gas system.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the detail design modification.  City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved these cost summaries.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project will address the risks associated with a gaseous chlorine system while providing a safer storage and handling system for plant staff.  The potential threat of an accidental or intentional release of chlorine gas will be eliminated with this project. \n \nThis work will occur within the secure area of the PAWP that is not accessible to the public, so public meetings and outreach are not anticipated. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nCH2M’s contract compliance number is CC006247 and expires 2/22/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CH2M HILL Engineers, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 26.8%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Ch2M Hill Engineers has proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nDLZ, Inc                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nHatch Associates Consultants                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nResource International                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \nThe certification of Ch2M Hill Engineers and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
