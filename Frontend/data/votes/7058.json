    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew the contract with SGI Matrix, LLC for security system parts, installation, maintenance, monitoring, repair, and support services for both new installations and existing security equipment for various locations of the Department of Public Utilities.  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities currently uses the Frontier access control system to secure many of its facilities. This contract provides for the parts, service and maintenance of all access control products under the Frontier Security brand, including but not limited to badge readers, reader control modules, serial boards, reader distribution panels, Matrix subsystem gateways, door controllers, building controller items, and all associated connections. \n \nBatteries and building controllers are considered consumables and therefore not covered under the maintenance services. Building controllers are considered end-of-life items and must be replaced with new installs rather than repairs. This agreement provides for the repair, replacement, and servicing of all accessible components and devices, panel and peripheral component replacement for the associated electronic systems, emergency service calls, and 24 hours a day, 7 days a week telephone support.\n \nSGI Matrix, LLC has installed all of the badge readers and has maintained the software, subsystem, and building controllers since the systems were installed at Department of Public Utilities facilities. SGI Matrix utilizes KNS Services as a subcontractor on the project to run cabling and place the equipment, but SGI Matrix, LLC will provide installation, final hook-up, and testing and programming of devices. \n \nDue to the proprietary nature of the security software and compatibility of existing security equipment, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and renew the contract with SGI Matrix, LLC.\n \nOrdinance 1914-2022 authorized the original contract for one year from the date of execution, with the option to renew annually based upon mutual agreement, budgeted funds, and approval by City Council. This ordinance authorizes the first renewal. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be requested.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nSGI Matrix, LLC | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #019553 | Expires 2/8/2025 | \nThe company does not hold MBE or WBE status.\n \nSUBCONTRACTOR:\n \nKNS Services, Inc. | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #005443 | Expires 2/22/2025 | \nThe subcontractor does not hold MBE or WBE status.\n \nNeither the Contractor nor Subcontractor are debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$33,210.00 (including $3,000.00 for contingencies) is budgeted and available for this contract.\n \n$3,088.30 has been spent in 2023\n$29,489.00 was spent in 2022 \n$30,903.00 was spent in 2021 \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to avoid a lapse in provision of the necessary security equipment and services provided under the contract. Late receipt of the new quote did not allow enough time for a 30-day ordinance to be submitted and approved by City Council ahead of the current contract’s expiration on July 17, 2023. As the vendor provides proprietary equipment and services for access controls at various locations of the Department of Public Utilities, a lapse in these services may pose security risks. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to renew the contract with SGI Matrix, LLC for security system parts, installation, maintenance, monitoring, repair, and support services for the Department of Public Utilities; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $33,210.00 split among the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds; and to declare an emergency.
