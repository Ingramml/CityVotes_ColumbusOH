    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe goal of a Community Reinvestment Area is neighborhood revitalization and stabilization.\n \nThis Ordinance will create the Crosswoods Community Reinvestment Area (the “CRA”), and provide for real property tax exemptions within the area in accordance with Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code. The real property tax exemptions provided herein will be available only for parcels that are residentially zoned, or parcels where residential use is permitted by variance, and only for properties that are actually used for residential purposes.\n \nThe Ordinance will provide for exemptions from increases in real property taxation resulting from the construction of new housing, the conversion of buildings from commercial use to residential use, and the renovation of existing single and multi-family housing units, within the established boundaries.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal impact. No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo create the Crosswoods Community Reinvestment Area; to authorize real property tax exemptions as authorized by Chapter 3735 of the Ohio Revised Code; and to provide that the City’s existing Community Reinvestment Area Housing Council shall serve as the Housing Council for the Crosswoods Community Reinvestment Area.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has established a goal of fostering private sector investment to build mixed income neighborhoods dispersed throughout the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Council of the City of Columbus (hereinafter “Council”) desires to pursue reasonable and legitimate incentive measures to assist and encourage development in specific areas of the City of Columbus that have not enjoyed the benefit of reinvestment from remodeling or new construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1698-78, passed on August 3, 1978, authorized the Department of Development to carry out a Community Reinvestment Program, pursuant to Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code, and approved certain administrative procedures for the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City’s current CRA Housing Council formed by the passage of Ordinance No. 2412-2003 on November 10, 2003, as required by R.C. Section 3735.69, shall serve as the CRA Housing Council for the Crosswoods CRA; and\n \nWHEREAS, a housing survey (Exhibit A) and a map of the proposed CRA (Exhibit B), as required by R.C. Section 3735.66, have been prepared and are attached to this Ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council adopted the revised changes to the City’s residential tax incentive policy in July 2022 by adopting Ordinance No. 1843-2022, which is codified in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development shall designate the Crosswoods CRA as Market Ready, Ready for Revitalization, or Ready for Opportunity (the “Area Designation”) area as provided in Chapter 4565; and\n \nWHEREAS, specific terms and requirements for the Crosswoods CRA will adhere to the requirements of Chapter 4565, including all requirements specific to the Area Designation assigned to the CRA; and\nWHEREAS, the remodeling of existing structures for residential use and construction of new residential structures in the Crosswoods CRA constitutes a public purpose for which real property exemptions may be granted, and would serve to encourage economic stability, maintain real property values, and generate new employment opportunities; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1. Council finds that the housing survey in Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein, reflects that the area depicted in Exhibit B, attached hereto and incorporated herein, constitutes an area in which housing facilities or structures of historical significance are located and new housing construction and repair of existing facilities or structures are discouraged. Council finds that the construction of new structures and the remodeling of existing structures are declared to be a public purpose for which exemptions from real property taxation may be granted as set forth hereinafter.\n \nSection 2.
