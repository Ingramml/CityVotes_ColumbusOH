    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground\nThe goal of a Community Reinvestment Area is neighborhood revitalization and stabilization.\n \nThis Ordinance will create the West Scioto Community Reinvestment Area (the “CRA”), and provide for real property tax exemptions within the area in accordance with Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code. The real property tax exemptions provided herein will be available only for parcels that are residentially zoned, or parcels where residential use is permitted by variance, and only for properties that are actually used for residential purposes.\n \nThe Ordinance will provide for exemptions from increases in real property taxation resulting from the construction of new housing, the conversion of buildings from commercial use to residential use, and the renovation of existing single and multi-family housing units, within the established boundaries.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal impact. No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo create the West Scioto Community Reinvestment Area; to authorize real property tax exemptions as authorized by Chapter 3735 of the Ohio Revised Code; and to provide that the City’s existing Community Reinvestment Area Housing Council shall serve as the Housing Council for the West Scioto Community Reinvestment Area.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has established a goal of fostering private sector investment to build mixed income neighborhoods dispersed throughout the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Council of the City of Columbus (hereinafter “Council”) desires to pursue reasonable and legitimate incentive measures to assist and encourage development in specific areas of the City of Columbus that have not enjoyed the benefit of reinvestment from remodeling or new construction; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1698-78, passed on August 3, 1978, authorized the Department of Development to carry out a Community Reinvestment Program, pursuant to Sections 3735.65 to 3735.70 of the Ohio Revised Code, and approved certain administrative procedures for the program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City’s current CRA Housing Council formed by the passage of Ordinance No. 2412-2003 on November 10, 2003, as required by R.C. Section 3735.69, shall serve as the CRA Housing Council for the West Scioto CRA; and\n \nWHEREAS, a housing survey (Exhibit A) and a map of the proposed CRA (Exhibit B), as required by\nR.C. Section 3735.66, have been prepared and are attached to this Ordinance; and\n \nWHEREAS, Council adopted the revised changes to the City’s residential tax incentive policy in July 2022 by adopting Ordinance No. 1843-2022, which is codified in Chapter 4565 of the Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development shall designate the West Scioto CRA as Market Ready, Ready for Revitalization, or Ready for Opportunity (the “Area Designation”) area as provided in Chapter 4565; and\n \nWHEREAS, specific terms and requirements for the West Scioto CRA will adhere to the requirements of Chapter 4565, including all requirements specific to the Area Designation assigned to the CRA; and\nWHEREAS, the remodeling of existing structures for residential use and construction of new residential structures in the West Scioto CRA constitutes a public purpose for which real property exemptions may be granted, and would serve to encourage economic stability, maintain real property values, and generate new employment opportunities; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.

The term “multiple unit” shall mean a new structure or remodeling incorporating both residential and commercial uses, provided, however, that only those portions of the newly constructed structure or remodeling that are used for residential purposes will qualify for the abatement under this Ordinance. The entire new or remodeled structure does not need to be abated or qualify for abatement in order for the abatement to apply to the qualifying portions of the structure. Abatements may be claimed for, and will only apply to, portions of a structure meeting the required criteria.\nSection 6.  That Council reserves the right to re-evaluate the Designation of the West Scioto Community Reinvestment Area after December 31, 2028, at which time Council may direct the Housing Officer not to accept any applications for exemptions as directed in Section 3735.67 of the Ohio Revised Code.\nSection 7.  That it is declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provisions of the Ordinance are held to be invalid, the remaining provisions and the application of such provision to any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid shall not be affected thereby.\nSection 8.  That the CRA Housing Council formed by City Council by the passage of Ordinance No. 2412-2003 on November 10, 2003, and any subsequent amendments thereto, including re-appointments and new appointments of members as authorized by that legislation, is appointed as the CRA Housing Council for the West Scioto CRA to fulfill the duties required by R.C.

Upon passage, the Director shall send, by certified mail, one copy of the Ordinance and a map of the community reinvestment area in sufficient detail to denote the specific boundaries of the area, to the State Director of Development.\n \nSection 13. This Council further authorizes and directs the Mayor, the Clerk of Council, the Director of Development and/or other appropriate officers of the City, to prepare and sign all agreements and documents and to take any other actions as may be appropriate or necessary to implement this Ordinance.\n \nSection 14.
