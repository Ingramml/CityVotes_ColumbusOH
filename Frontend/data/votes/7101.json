    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with JLD Construction Services for the Champions Drainage Improvements - Hole 6 and 7 Project. The contract amount is $321,139.00, with a contingency of $76,861.00, for a total amount of $398,000.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $400,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThis project will improve the drainage capacity of the fairways at holes 6 and 7 at Champions Golf Course in a manner that will be easy to maintain over the years. These holes are adjacent to Alum Creek and these flat areas often flood due to an aging storm system. The existing under drain system on both fairways has not functioned properly for several years resulting in flooding after modest rain events. This flooding forces closures at the course for several days while the water recedes. These improvements to the course should eliminate extended down time, programming disruptions, or damage to the fairways at holes 6 and 7 as a result of the flooding. This project is expected to be complete by the end of 2023. This project will also be coordinated with the stream bank work occurring in the same area. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on April 11, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on May 2, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nJLD Construction Services (MBE): $321,139.00\nDriven Excavating (MAJ): $331,753.00\nRighter Company (MAJ): $349,018.00\nTyevco (MAJ): $781,368.90\nJohn Eramo and Sons (MAJ): $895,362.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that JLD Construction Services was the lowest and most responsive bidder.
