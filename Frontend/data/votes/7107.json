    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for professional services and construction services for the JP Screening Improvements (Engineering Mod #2) project, CIP #650252-100010. \n \nThis is a contract with Burgess & Niple for Professional Engineering Services (Design Professional, or “DP” services) for the JPWWTP Screenings Improvements project. Burgess & Niple has provided Preliminary Design Services (Step 1) and will provide Detailed Design and Bidding Services (Step 2) and Services During Construction (Step 3).\n \nDuring Step 2, Detailed Design, the City determined that a new screenings facility with the proper space, redundancy, and equipment is needed to meet current wastewater standards. The new facility will be designed and constructed in the near future when budget allows. As a result of this decision, this unplanned modification is being generated to revise and reduce the scope of this project to meet immediate needs so that the current facility can remain operational until the project that includes the new facility can be designed and constructed.\n \nA future, third modification will be requested for Step 3, Engineering Services During Construction, which will include technical project representation (TPR) duties, construction phase engineering, start-up and commissioning assistance, and record documentation.\n \nConstruction Management Services will be performed by others.\n \nPlanning Area is Citywide \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide”. \nTIMELINE:  The Professional Engineer Services Agreement was signed in May 2019 and provided Step 1, Preliminary Design Services. Step 2 services began in May of 2021 and are anticipated to end in the first quarter of 2024. Construction Bids are anticipated to be received in the second quarter of 2024 and it is anticipated that the Notice to Proceed for the construction contract will be given in the third quarter of 2024. Step 3 services will be obtained through a third contract modification in the second quarter of 2024 corresponding to the construction contract. The Professional Engineering Services Contract will continue beyond completion of construction to provide “as-built” record documents of the constructed facilities.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The original engineering agreement amount is $787,950.00. Two additional contract renewals are anticipated at this time.\n                     \n          Original Contract, PO167890 (Step 1, Preliminary Design)………………….......$   787,950.00\n                     Modification No.1, PO280654 (Step 2, Detailed Design)……………………....$ 1,878,897.00\n                     Modification No.2, Current, Unplanned (Revised Step 2, Detailed Design)…….$             0.00\n                     Modification No. 3, Future (Step 3, Services During Construction)………….......$ 2,160,000.00\n                     CONTRACT TOTAL:…………………………………………………………$ 4,826,847.00\n \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe Screenings Building at JPWWTP was originally constructed in the 1930s with a treatment capacity of 50 MGD. That building has been renovated several times over the years with the last time being in 2008. The current maximum hydraulic capacity is now 165 MGD. Since the last renovation, the plant has had difficulty handling the screenings that come into the plant during wet-weather flows. As a result, there is a heightened risk of overflows and bypasses. This project had planned to use today’s technology to provide improvements to the screenings facility and reduce the risk of overflows and bypasses, but during Detailed Design, it was determined that the proposed improvements would be at the limit and in some cases beyond the limits of the proposed screenings equipment. As a result, the DP was given direction by the City to investigate and generate concepts to replace the existing screenings process with a new one that has the proper space, redundancy, and equipment to meet current wastewater standards. Those concepts were submitted to the City in November of 2022 and meetings with DOSD Administration and JPWWTP to review those concepts were held shortly thereafter. As a result of those meetings, the City determined that a new facility is required to replace the existing facility when the budget allows. It was also determined that the scope of this project will be revised and reduced to meet immediate needs of the facility so that it can remain operational until the future project that includes the new facility can be implemented and completed.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 11/16/2018.   Four proposals were received:\n \nName                                               C.C.
