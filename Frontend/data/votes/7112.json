    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract renewal for professional engineering services during construction with Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. for the Laboratory Upgrades project, CIP #690554-100000, in an amount up to $809,250.00.\n \nThe current laboratory spaces at the 910 Water Quality Assurance Lab (WQAL), the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP), and the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) are more than 20 years old and are in need of upgrades to meet current laboratory, ergonomic, and architectural guidelines and standards. The work under the original contract completed the evaluation and preliminary design report for the upgrades to the Water Quality Assurance Lab, Dublin Road Water Plant Lab and Parsons Ave. Water Plant Lab.    \n \nThe first planned contract renewal provided funding for the detailed design and permitting for construction of the Water Quality Assurance Lab renovations including: new countertops and casework; sinks and fixtures; lighting; and laboratory systems such as fume hoods, refrigeration and DI water systems and design of a Lab Information Management System (LIMS).\n \nThe second planned contract renewal provided funding for the engineering services during construction of the Water Quality Assurance Lab renovations as well as the detailed design of the Dublin Road Water Plant lab upgrade including new flooring; lighting; countertops and casework; sinks and fixtures; and laboratory systems.\n \nThis planned contract renewal #3 will provide funding for the detailed design of the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) lab upgrades and the engineering services during construction for the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP) lab upgrades.\n \nPlanned future renewals for this project include:\nRenewal #4 Engineering Services During Construction for PAWP Lab upgrades  \n \nThe planning area is 68 Dublin Road Corridor.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:\nThe original agreement did not establish a total term for all planned renewals.  The start of each planned renewal was/is contingent upon the progress and anticipated completion of the previous phase and contract.  The original agreement established the first phase of the project for the evaluation of the facilities and preparation of the Preliminary Design Report. \n \nThis renewal is the third of four planned renewals of the contract.  The planned term for each renewal thus far has been approximately 12-18 months.  \n \nThe expiration date is estimated to occur June 2026, but will be contingent upon the construction duration of the PAWP Laboratory Improvements project.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $809,250.00\nOriginal (PO 078201; ORD 1802-2017):                                                                                          $668,000.00\nRenewal #1 (PO188775; ORD 1760-2019):                                                 $1,560,000.00\nRenewal #2 (PO284056 & PO284058, ORD 1500-2021):                           $2,064,500.00\nRenewal #3 (Current):                                                                                               $809,250.00\nRenewal #4 (future):                                                                                                                    $600,000.00\nTotal                                                                                                                                                                           $5,701,750.00 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis work is based on the Preliminary Design Report prepared as the first phase, original agreement, of this project.  The scope was divided into a preliminary design phase and a detailed design phase to have better understanding of the design and construction costs upon completion of the preliminary design phase.  The Engineering Services During Construction is to perform technical engineering review and support during the construction phase by the consultant that prepared the design.  This will supplement the services provided by the Professional Construction Manager for the DRWP Lab Upgrade project.  Bidding out these services would delay the construction phase of the project and increase costs to City.  \n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared a detailed estimate of cost per task for detailed scope of work, broken down by project task.  City Project management staff reviewed and approved these cost summaries.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project is necessary to bring the facilities up to current code compliance standards for the Water Quality Assurance Lab, the Dublin Road Water Plant Lab and the Parsons Ave. Water Plant Lab.  These facilities are all essential and integral components in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water is essential to economic growth and development.\n \nPublic informational meetings are not anticipated for this project, all proposed work is within the secure boundaries of the water quality assurance lab or the water treatment facilities.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nCH2M’s contract compliance number is CC006247 and expires 2/22/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CH2M HILL Engineers, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Ch2M Hill Engineers, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract renewal with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this renewal is expected to be 25.8%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Ch2M Hill Engineers has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nPRIME AE Group, Inc.                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE*\nResource International                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \n* PRIME AE Group is currently certified as an MAJ  by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  They were certified by ODI as an MBE at the time this contract was implemented and is to be counted as MBE spend throughout the term of the contract.\n \nThe certification of Ch2M Hill Engineers and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
