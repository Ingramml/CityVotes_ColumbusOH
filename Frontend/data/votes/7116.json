    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with TFH-EB Inc. dba Water Works to increase the contract amount by $15,000.00 to provide residential emergency repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $  40,000.00                     Ord. 0333-2022                                          PO316907\nModification No. 1 amount                     $150,000.00                     Ord. 1159-2022                      PO326559\nRenewal/Mod No. 2 amount                     $  12,500.00                     Ord. 2877-2022                                          PO361010\nModification No. 3 amount                     $100,000.00      Ord. 0327-2023              PO369599\nModification No. 4 amount                     $100,000.00      Ord. 1517-2023                                            \nModification No. 5 amount                     $  15,000.00                     Ord. 1693-2023                       \n \nTotal contract amount                                          $417,500.00 \n \nThe department advertised RFQ020531 on Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide emergency mechanical repairs on November 22, 2021 with bids being due on December 16, 2021.  The Emergency Repair Program is a home repair program operated by the Housing Division.  The program was established to assist low and moderate income homeowners with plumbing, sewer repair/replacement, water line repair/replacement, hot water tanks, furnaces, and electrical issues that would impact a household remaining safely in their home.  Most homeowners are at or below 50% AMI as defined by HUD with exceptions allowed up to 80% AMI.\n \nThe amount of additional funds expended under this modification will be $15,000.00.  The need for additional goods/services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded due to an updated interpretation of the allowable scope of work for capital funds, that resulted in a need for general fund dollars for home repair project scopes that do not fit the requirements for capital funds.\n \nA comprehensive RFQ was done in 2021 for these services, and contractors were identified at that time.   A new RFQ will be done with capital and general fund dollars in the Fall of 2023.  Prices were initially established with the original contract awarded from RFQ020531.\n \nIn May 2022, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1159-2022 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn November 2022, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 2877-2022 to renew the contract for one \nadditional year and to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn February 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 0327-2023 to modify the contract for one \nadditional year and to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn June 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1517-2023 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nThis legislation will modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract terms will not change.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Division of Housing’s 2023 General Fund budget, but will require a transfer from Object Class 01 to Object Class 03.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004777 and expires 3/9/2025.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with TFH-EB Inc. dba Water Works; to provide residential emergency repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program; to authorize the transfer and expenditure of up to $15,000.00.
