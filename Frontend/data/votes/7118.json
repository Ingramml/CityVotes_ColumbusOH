($15,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Charles D Jones dba C2U Construction LLC to increase the contract amount by $15,000.00 to provide residential emergency repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $100,000.00                     Ord. 0823-2023                                          PO380445\nModification No. 1 amount                     $  75,000.00                     Ord. 1520-2023                     \nModification No. 2 amount                     $  15,000.00                     Ord. 1695-2023\nTotal contract amount                                          $190,000.00\n \nThe department advertised and notified 401 registered vendor of RFQ022527 on August 2, 2022, and 626\nregistered vendors were notified of RFQ023115 on October 11, 2022, through Vendor Services seeking\ncontractors to provide emergency electrical services. Both competitively bid processes did not receive\nbids from contractors. The Department of Development then sent eight (8) targeted emails to contractors\nrequesting firm/fixed pricing to be submitted by December 16, 2022 from vendors that responded through\noutreach events.\n \nTwo (2) contractors replied with pricing, Charles D. Jones dba C2U Construction LLC (registered with\nthe city, but not certified MWBE firm) and Word of Mouth Electric & Rehab LLC (registered with the\ncity, but not certified MWBE firm). Only Charles D. Jones dba C2U Construction LLC provided\nfirm/fixed pricing. C2U Construction LLC shall have one subcontractor, McGhee Electric LLC (not\nregistered with the City).\n \nThe amount of additional funds expended under this modification will be $15,000.00.  The need for additional goods/services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded due to an updated interpretation of the allowable scope of work for capital funds, that resulted in a need for general fund dollars for home repair project scopes that do not fit the requirements for capital funds.\n \nA comprehensive RFQ was done in 2021 for these services, and contractors were identified at that time.   A new RFQ will be done with capital and general fund dollars in the Fall of 2023.  Prices were initially established with the original contract awarded from RFQ020531.\n \nIn April 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 0823-2023 to enter into the contract with Charles D Jones dba C2U Construction LLC\n \nIn June 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1520-2023 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nThis legislation will modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract terms will not change.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Division of Housing’s 2023 General Fund budget, but will require a transfer from Object Class 01 to Object Class 03.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 043528 and expires 1/9/2025.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Charles D Jones dba C2U Construction LLC; to provide residential emergency repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program; to authorize the transfer and expenditure of up to $15,000.00.
