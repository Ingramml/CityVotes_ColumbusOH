    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement with Mount Carmel Health System Foundation and Southeast, Inc. for Year 2 of the department’s Elevate 1.0 program, in an amount up to $150,000.00 and $100,000.00, respectively.  The term of each Grant Agreement shall be from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024.\n \nIn 2022, the department executed Beneficiary Agreements using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to a number social service agencies to support and increase the organizational capacity of non-profit organizations that experienced revenue losses such as cancelled fundraising events, decreases in donor support, and increased expenditures such as PPE, virtual meeting licenses, and related hardware caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  2022 was the first year of the three year Elevate 1.0 program.  The grants awarded under this ordinance is known as Elevate 1.0, Year 2.\n \nBecause the funding source for Year 2 is general fund dollars, the agreement type to be used is a Grant Agreement, not a Beneficiary Agreement.  The Grant Agreement will be an original agreement as the terms and conditions for Year 2 will be different from Year 1, although the purpose remains the same.  Pending general fund funding availability for Year 3, these Grant Agreements will be modified in 2024.\n \nThe Notice of Financial Award (NOFA) was advertised from April 22, 2022, through May 13, 2022, on the City’s Website (Department of Development webpage), the Human Service Chamber of Franklin County’s website, and by press release.  The City received 86 proposals for $9,875,000.00 in requests.  Forty-eight community agencies were recommended for the $5,000,000.00 in available funding.  Two agencies are listed in this ordinance with funding for 46 agencies included in two other ordinances (Ordinances 1825-2023 and 1826-2023).  \n \nThe City of Columbus continues to see increases in the number of residents who lack access to affordable housing. Advocates report that anywhere between 300-600 people are living unsheltered in Columbus every day; the majority desire safe and affordable housing.  Additionally, infant mortality rates in Columbus and Franklin County remain alarmingly high for black babies. Immigrants and refugees relocate to Columbus because we are a welcoming city.  Columbus’ limited supply of housing, lack of knowledge about services and programs that support renting and homeownership, and lack of access to those services cause housing instability among immigrant and refugee residents. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exacerbate all these conditions for Columbus residents.  Every organization that was recommended for funding provides services in at least one of the following Elevate! NOFA focus areas:  Increasing Infant Vitality, Reducing Unsheltered Homelessness, or Increasing Housing Stability Among Immigrant and Refugee households. \n \nFunding will be advanced on a predetermined schedule.  Advancement of funds is needed because the organization does not have funding available to be reimbursed for program expenses.  The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order.  Before the second advance is made, the organization shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the Grant Agreement.  This will continue throughout the term of the Grant Agreement.  Additionally, these programs/grant agreement may include reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of the programs which expenditure is hereby deemed to be a valid public purpose in that such purchase will address the immediate needs of program participants.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available in the Department of Development’s 2023 General Fund budget.  Funding was appropriated in object class 03, but will transferred to object class 05.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor numbers are 011780 and expires 11/16/2024 and 004491 and expires 2/17/2025, respectively.\n \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement with Mount Carmel Health System Foundation and Southeast, Inc., in an amount up to $150,000.00 and $100,000.00, respectively, for Year 2 of the department’s Elevate 1.0 program to support and increase the organizational capacity of the non-profit organizations that experienced revenue losses such as cancelled fundraising events, decreases in donor support, and increased expenditures such as PPE, virtual meeting licenses, and related hardware caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; to authorize the transfer of $250,000.00 from Object Class 03 to Object Class 05 in the Department of Development’s 2023 General Fund budget; to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 of General Fund monies; to authorize an agreement start date of July 1, 2023; to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of programs included in the Grant Agreement; and to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement.
