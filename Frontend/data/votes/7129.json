    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to execute a Subrecipient Agreement - Not for-Profit Service Contract with Nationwide Children’s Hospital to provide reproductive health education to Columbus area schools. Funding was awarded to CelebrateOne by the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services and accepted via Ordinance 0473-2023.  \n \nNationwide Children's Hospital has been the lead in teen reproductive health education efforts within selected Columbus City Schools in the CelebrateOne high priority neighborhoods of Linden, Franklinton, Hilltop, Northeast, Northland, South Side, Southeast and Near East.  This Subrecipient Agreement - Not for-Profit Service Contract will support the work that Nationwide Children's Hospital is already doing to improve reproductive health planning by implementing evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programming in schools.\n \nIn addition to having one of the highest infant mortality rates in the nation, Ohio ranks 23rd out of all 50 states for teenage pregnancies. Teen pregnancy is a significant contributor to pre-maturity, a leading cause of infant mortality, because pregnant teens have a higher risk for having a baby born too small or too soon.  A recent examination of the National Survey of Family Growth revealed that teens who received comprehensive sex education were 50% less likely to report a pregnancy than those who received abstinence-only education. Currently, without any state health education standards, many teens in Ohio and Franklin County do not have access to comprehensive, medically-accurate sex education.\n \nThe Office of CelebrateOne, in partnership with Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Nationwide Children’s Hospital, reinforces peer education by engaging youth in Columbus City Schools from the CelebrateOne neighborhoods. Peer education supports the development of healthy lifestyles and responsible choices by adolescents. Peer educators will receive training and incentives to increase their knowledge of essential, evidence-based reproductive health information, establish important leadership skills, and gain the confidence to engage their peers and larger community in vital conversations.\n                                                                                  \nThis ordinance provides funding for the program through June 30, 2024 to allow for Reproductive Health Education programming through the 2023-2024 school year.  \n \nVendor Information:  Nationwide Children’s Hospital  DAX #006069, Tax ID # 31-4379441 Non-Profit\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This grant agreement utilizes a $250,000.00 reimbursement grant from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services originally accepted and appropriated by Ord. 0473-2023, Grant # G402301 Franklin County Board of Commissioners TANF Services. This Subrecipient Agreement - Not for-Profit Service Contract will be funded from Grant# G402301 within the General Government Grants Fund 2220.  \n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Office of CelebrateOne, on behalf of the Office of the Mayor, to execute a Subrecipient Agreement - Not for-Profit Service Contract with Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Inc. for work in teen reproductive health education services in support of the CelebrateOne’s goal to improve reproductive health planning in Columbus and Franklin County; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $250,000.00 from the General Government Grants Fund.
