    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \nThe Office of CelebrateOne has been renewed for a grant award from the Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services to support the Health Equity Innovation initiative. The original grant award was made in 2021 and legislated via Ordinance 3217-2021.  This ordinance is necessary to accept and appropriate the grant renewal funds in the amount of $121,008.11 for the period of August 1, 2022 - July 31, 2023 and assign a new grant number, to be determined, to allow for accurate financial tracking and reporting.\n \nSince 2014, CelebrateOne has led the development and implementation of strategic community-based initiatives targeting the unacceptably high infant mortality rate in Franklin County. Infant deaths are higher in CelebrateOne priority neighborhoods and are fueled by long standing racial disparities, a lack of education, and limited resources and support. \n \nTo help achieve the goal of eradicating infant mortality in Columbus and Franklin County, CelebrateOne has adopted a new strategic plan that calls for deeper investments in racial equity, expanded efforts to address the social determinants of health, and a strong, connected health and social services system. \n \nFranklin County has re-committed $121,008.11 towards the implementation of innovations in Health Equity to improve health and birth outcomes for mother and baby. Specifically, this funding will support the development of community-based care options that provide: prenatal, postpartum and pediatric care; alternative birthing options; doula, midwife and lactation consultant access; comprehensive dietary support and education; mentoring and counseling services; and connections to community-based resources. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Health Equity Innovation initiative is funded by the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services as a reimbursement grant. This effort does not generate any revenue or require a City match. This ordinance allows for the acceptance and appropriation of the renewal grant funding up to $121,008.11 within General Government Grant Fund 2220 and Grant #TBD.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Office of CelebrateOne to accept grant funds from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services in the amount of $121,008.11; and to authorize the renewal appropriation to the Office of CelebrateOne in the City’s General Government Grant Fund.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services awarded a Health Equity Innovation Grant to the Office of CelebrateOne in 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, Grant #402105 was established in 2021 and funding was accepted and appropriated with Ordinance 3217-2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, the reimbursable grant was renewed by the Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services in the amount of $ 121,008.11 for the period of August 1, 2022 to July 31, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, a new grant number will be assigned to this grant for purpose of financial tracking and reporting; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Office of CelebrateOne to accept and appropriate the renewal grant funds from the Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE \n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Office of CelebrateOne is hereby authorized and directed to accept grant renewal funds in the amount of $ 121,008.11 from the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services for the Health Equity Innovation initiative for the period beginning August 1, 2022 and ending July 31, 2023. \n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the fund known as the City’s General Government Grant Fund 2220, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources during the grant period, the sum of $ 121,008.11 is appropriated to Grant #402105 for the Office of CelebrateOne Department, Division No. 40-05, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n                \nSECTION 3.  At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
