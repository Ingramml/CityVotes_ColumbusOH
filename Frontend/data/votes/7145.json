    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance approves the acceptance of certain territory (AN23-009) by the city of Columbus. The Ohio Revised Code stipulates that to be effective, City acceptance must take place a minimum of 60 days from the receipt by the City Clerk of the approval notice from the county.

Franklin County approved the annexation on May 9, 2023 and the City Clerk received notice on May 16, 2023.\nFISCAL IMPACT:\nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo accept the application (AN23-009) of Bible Truth Tabernacle for the annexation of certain territory containing 6.4± acres in Jackson Township; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, a petition for the annexation of certain territory in Jackson Township was filed on behalf of Bible Truth Tabernacle on April 4, 2023; and\nWHEREAS, the petition was considered and approved by the Franklin County Board of Commissioners at a hearing on May 9, 2023; and\nWHEREAS, on May 16, 2023, the City Clerk received from Franklin County a certified copy of the resolution addressing the petition; and\nWHEREAS, sixty days have now elapsed since receipt of the resolution in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the city of Columbus to accept the annexation of the territory addressed by the petition; now, therefore, and \nWHEREAS,  an emergency exists in the usual daily operation in the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to pass this ordinance due to the need to finalize this annexation under the city’s new program which also enables related rezoning legislation for multifamily development to be considered prior to Council’s summer recess; now, therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\nSECTION 1.
