    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the existing contracts with Moody Nolan and Elford, Inc., for the Fran Ryan Center Project. The modification amounts being authorized by this ordinance are $190,270.00 for the Moody Nolan contract and $23,436,743.00 for the Elford contract. The total amount being authorized by this ordinance is $23,627,013.00. \n \nThis project’s mission is to support the ability of the Recreation and Parks Department to meet the needs of Columbus residents by creating facilities that are stimulating, providing support for the arts and creative community, as well as providing important park space for the Olde Towne East Community. This four acre site, formerly the Douglas School and located at 51 South Douglass Street, was purchased in 2020. With the procurement of this property, the Recreation and Parks Department acquired a unique opportunity to develop an innovative senior-focused community center and park. This will allow the department to offer expanded and more efficient space for new programs, services, and recreational opportunities for the surrounding community. This space will also be senior-centric and support the programming that took place at the former Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis Center.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department is delivering this project using a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) delivery method. By modifying these contracts, Moody Nolan and Elford will be able to progress to the next phase of the Construction Manager at Risk format to build this facility. The previous ordinances allowed for the design phase and pre-construction phase of the project to be completed. It also initiated the procurement of long lead time materials, including HVAC equipment, electrical equipment, and structural steel. This portion of the project will proceed with additional professional services needed and full construction of the new facility. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nMoody Nolan, Inc.\n300 Spruce Street, Suite 300\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nJonathan Moody, (614) 461-4664\nContract Compliance Number: 004920\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: March 15, 2024\n \nElford, Inc.\n1220 Dublin Road\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nBrandt Quinn, (614) 800-5126\nContract Compliance Number: 006059\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 31, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as this new facility is intended to serve the senior creative programs formerly housed at the Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis facilities. Several of these programs have been re-housed at the Thompson Community Center and the Center of Performing Arts. As a result, there are programs that no longer have a space to serve our residents. In addition to the ongoing programming space needs, keeping this project on its current established schedule is critical to managing this project’s costs.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The Fran Ryan Center and surrounding park will offer extensive programming opportunities for the community and will also be a significant green-space for the Old Towne East Neighborhood. This new building will be used to house programming that no longer has space at the former Golden Hobby Shop and Martin Janis sites.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: A survey and targeted community outreach meetings have taken place. City staff visited Olde Towne East Neighborhood Association and Near East Commission meetings to discuss the project. Staff also held public meetings to discuss initial findings of the survey results. Hard copies of the survey were distributed and picked up in places of public gatherings. Components of the project website, including the survey, were available in the Somali and Spanish languages. All of this public feedback will shape what programs and amenities will be included within the building and on the surrounding green-space. \n \nA website has been created to keep the public informed of the project’s progress and can be found at the following web address: <https://columbusrecparks.com/connect/about/capital-improvement-projects/fran-ryan-center/> \n \nArea(s) Affected: Near East (56)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by addressing the need to provide space for programs that are both senior and arts focused.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,767,230.00 was legislated for the design phase of the Fran Ryan Center Project, previously known as the Community Creative Campus and Park Design Project, by Ordinance 2037-2021. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $190,270.00. This amount ($190,270.00) is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,957,500.00. \n \nThe expenditure of $5,000,000.00 was legislated for the construction phase of the Fran Ryan Center Project by Ordinance No. 0101-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $23,436,743.00. This modified amount ($23,436,743.00) is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $28,436,743.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify existing contracts with Moody Nolan and Elford, Inc., for the Fran Ryan Center Project; to authorize the transfer of $1,827,013.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize an amendment of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $23,627,013.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
