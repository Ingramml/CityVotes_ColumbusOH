    "description": "BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to renew the existing contract with Ceridian HCM, Inc. and provide funding for the support, hosting, services, hardware, and maintenance of Dayforce; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,324,800.00 from the Department of Technology operating fund; to authorize the expenditure of $70,000.00 from the Employee Benefits fund.\nThe original contract for implementation and a three year term after the go-live date, was authorized by Ordinance 0848-2019 and passed on April 29, 2019. The agreement includes licensing, hosting, maintenance, support, and professional services for the Dayforce system and time clocks manufactured by Ceridian for enterprise-wide benefits administration, payroll, personnel management, and employee self-service system. The City Auditor’s Office originally procured these services with Ceridian through the competitive bidding RFP process in Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code. The original contract term ends September 18, 2023, three (3) years from production go-live date, as specified in the agreement between the City and Ceridian. A renewal is necessary to continue the subscription to ensure no service interruption in the City’s payroll process, personnel operations, and benefits administration.\nThe City Auditor has negotiated a three (3) year extended renewal term with Ceridian, with each year contingent upon funding being approved and appropriated annually by City Council. Year one of the renewal will contain no increase in the current fees. This will be the fourth year the City has locked in pricing without an increase since 2019. Years two and three will allow the lesser of five percent or the annual increase in the Annual Inflation Index in the 12-month period preceding the increase less one percent (1%).  The amended agreement will also require ninety (90) days notice if the City decides to terminate the contract. \nThis contract also includes professional services related to managing configurations for the overall system and extra Benefits Administration related professional services. Additional services are being procured to support planned changes and updates to the City’s various benefits plans, open enrollment planning, and any changes necessary to facilitate exports or reporting. By bundling the hours with services related to this contract, the City can receive these services at a reduced rate.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance will fund year one of the three year extended term for contract renewal, maintenance and support of time clocks at the Department of Public Utilities and Department of Technology from available and approved funding in the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services fund as follows:\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nAmount\n\n\n\nCeridian Subscription and services\n\n1,308,300.00\n\n\n\nDepartment of Public Utilities clocks maintenance and support\n\n15,900.00\n\n\n\nDepartment of Technology clocks maintenance and support\n\n600.00\n\n\n\nTOTAL Technology Operating Fund\n\n1,324,800.00\n\n\n \nFor Benefits related professional services, funding is available in the Employee Benefits fund in the amount of $70,000.\nTITLE\nTo authorize the City Auditor to modify the existing contract with Ceridian HCM, Inc. for the renewal of the Dayforce software subscription, support, hardware, and services; to authorize the expenditure of $1,324,800.00 from the Department of Technology operating fund; to authorize the expenditure of $70,000.00 from the Employee Benefits fund.
