    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance amends sections 329.01 and 329.18 of the Columbus City Codes, with govern competitive sealed bidding, to update the responsible wage provisions of the code.\n \nThe responsible wage provision in Columbus requires that for certain city contracts, workers associated with the contract are paid no less than the lowest wage paid to a full-time City of Columbus employee. This amendment expands the responsible wage provision to all City service contracts except for construction contracts, which are procured through a different process. Previously, these provisions had applied only to certain industries.\n \nThe amendment also removes an exemption for small businesses. The City of Columbus seeks to support, promote, and contract with small businesses. This amendment ensures that all workers on City contracts are paid a responsible wage as defined by Section 329.01, across all sizes of businesses.\n \nThis amendment unifies the procurement process for service contracts, relieving some administrative burden and simplifying the procurement process for professional services. All new contracts that meet this definition, and any contracts being renewed or modified, will be subject to this amendment once it goes into effect.\n \nLastly, this amendment clarifies the responsibilities of the Director of Finance and Management to set, communicate, and publicize the responsible wage consistently each year. The amendment also clarifies that the responsible wage is determined in July, communicated in July, and in effect for the following calendar year.\n \nThis ordinance promotes fair wages for workers in Columbus by expanding the definition and implementation of the responsible wage in Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo amend sections 329.01 and 329.18; and to repeal existing sections 329.01 and 329.18 of the Columbus City Codes, to amend the responsible wage provisions in Columbus.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes defines and establishes the responsible wage for City service contracts; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to promote fair wages for all workers associated with City service contracts by paying all workers on such contracts a responsible wage; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
