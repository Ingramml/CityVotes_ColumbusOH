    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Ordinance No. 2622-2020 authorized the Director of the Department of Development to execute the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Tax Increment Financing Agreement dated as of December 28, 2016, as previously amended by the First Amendment to said agreement dated as of December 11, 2019 (collectively, the “Agreement”) relating to the three Polaris tax increment financing (TIF) areas and the exemption authorization provided by Ordinance No. 2600-2020. It also appropriated and authorized the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes and property tax rollback payments to be deposited into the Polaris TIF Fund as a result of the exemption authorization provided by Ordinance No. 2600-2020 for the purposes of the Agreement. The purpose of this ordinance is to amend Ordinance No. 2622-2020 in order to fully implement all of the terms and conditions of that piece of legislation and the Agreement, including, but not limited to, providing for workforce housing commitments, providing compensation to certain school districts, providing for the use of the Polaris TIF Fund revenue for projects as identified and determined by the City, providing for the collection of the City’s economic development fees, providing for the issuance of debt for the public infrastructure improvements, and making other technical modifications.\n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to amend Ordinance No. 2622-2020 for which the City, in support thereof, desires to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority and the developer and/or its affiliates to refund and issue new bonds at the most advantageous interest rate. Failure to pass as an emergency will very likely result in a higher interest rate on the bonds to be issued for the public infrastructure improvements. \n \nFiscal Impact\nThe City is authorizing the appropriation and expenditure of the service payments in lieu of taxes and property tax rollback payments (the “Service Payments”) to be deposited in the Polaris TIF Fund (4402) as a result of the exemption authorization provided by Ordinance No. 2600-2020 pursuant to the School Compensation Agreement with the Delaware Area Career Center. The City is also authorizing the appropriation and transfer of the Service Payments deposited in the Polaris TIF Fund (4402) to the Polaris Interchange Fund (7770) in an initial amount not to exceed $1,500,000.00 for years 2021-23; thereafter $500,000.00 per year during and including 2024 to 2027, and after that, 12.5% of the annual Service Payments as a result of the exemption authorization provided by Ordinance No. 2600-2020, shall be transferred to the Polaris Interchange Fund (7770). The City is similarly authorizing the appropriation and yearly transfer of $5,000.00 per each outstanding TIF in the Agreement during the term of the Agreement from the Service Payments deposited or to be deposited in the Polaris TIF Fund (4402) to the Business Tax Incentive (BTI) Fund (2229). Finally, the City is authorizing the appropriation and expenditure of the Service Payments deposited or to be deposited in the Polaris TIF Fund (4402), and not already appropriated as provided herein, pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement that the City plans to enter into by and among the City, the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and the developer and/or its affiliates. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 2622-2020 in order to be able to fully implement all of the terms and conditions of Ordinance No. 2622-2020 and the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Tax Increment Financing Agreement; to authorize the Director of the Department of the Development (the “Director”) to enter into a housing development agreement by and among the City, NP Capital Management Corp., and/or its affiliates; to authorize the Director to enter into a school compensation agreement by and among the City, the Delaware Area Career Center, and NP Capital Management Corp.; to authorize the Director to enter into a cooperative agreement by and among the City, the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and NP Capital Management Corp. and/or its affiliates; to authorize the appropriation, transfer, and/or expenditure of the service payments to be deposited into the Polaris TIF Fund for any of the following purposes: funding the school compensation agreement and the cooperative agreement as well as providing for the City’s retained service payments; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2622-2020, passed by City Council on November 23, 2020, authorized the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) to execute the Second Amendment to the Amended and Restated Tax Increment Financing Agreement dated as of December 28, 2016, as previously amended by the First Amendment to said agreement dated as of December 11, 2019, (collectively, the “Agreement”) relating to the three Polaris tax increment financing (TIF) areas and the exemption authorization provided by Ordinance No. 2600-2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2622-2020 also appropriated and authorized service payments in lieu of taxes and property tax rollback payments to be deposited into the Polaris TIF Fund No. 4402 as a result of the exemption authorization provided by Ordinance No. 2600-2020 for the purposes of the Agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend Ordinance No. 2622-2020 in order to be able to fully implement all of the terms and conditions of Ordinance No. 2622-2020 and the Agreement including, but not limited to, providing for affordable and workforce housing commitments, providing compensation to certain school districts, providing for the use of Polaris TIF Fund revenue for projects identified and determined by the City, providing for the collection of the City’s economic development fees, providing for issuances of debt for the public infrastructure improvements, and making other technical modifications; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it immediately necessary to amend Ordinance No. 2622-2020 for which the City, in support thereof, desires to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (the “Authority”) and the developer and/or its affiliates to refund the Authority’s existing bonds and then to issue new bonds at the most advantageous interest rate prior to anticipated interest rate increases thereby saving on interest, all for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare of the City; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
