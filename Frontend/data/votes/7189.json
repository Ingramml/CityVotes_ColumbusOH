    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 2948-2021, passed May 9, 2022, authorized the City of Columbus (“CITY”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Pinchal & Company LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), for a real property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of approximately $16,077,439, which included approximately $871,719 in acquisition costs, $869,720 in leasehold improvements and $14,336,000 in real property improvements to construct a proactive industrial distribution and warehouse facility consisting of approximately 286,720 square-feet on undeveloped land containing approximately 182 +/- acres south of State Route 317 on Lockbourne Road, Columbus, Ohio 43137, Parcel Number 495-263119 (the “ORIGINAL PARCEL”), building #4, legislated as Pinchal & Company LLC Building 1 within the City of Columbus and within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”). Additionally, the ENTERPRISE committed to create thirty-five (35) net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $1,092,000 at the PROJECT SITE. The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective August 15, 2022 with the PROJECT expected to begin approximately August 2022, with all real property improvements expected to be completed by approximately December 2023 and with the abatement to commence no later than 2024 nor extend beyond 2033 (Agreement No. 023-22-18).  \n \nAs of this date, there has not been a filing of the DTE-24 with the Franklin County Auditor, no Final Determination from the Ohio Department of Taxation, and so no forgone tax benefit has yet been received. \n \nParagraph fourteen within Section 8 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY” and paragraph fifteen of that same section states that “any requested amendment…to any of the terms of the AGREEMENT…shall require the payment to the CITY by the ENTERPRISE of an AMENDMENT FEE in the amount of five-hundred dollars ($500.00).”\n \nIn a letter from 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC on behalf of the ENTERPRISE dated May 17, 2023, received by the CITY and through ensuing correspondence, 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC confirmed that they had acquired ownership of a portion of the PROJECT SITE following an assignment of the purchase and sale agreement for the PROJECT SITE from ENTERPRISE to its affiliate, Prushing Farms Partners, LLC on May 27, 2022, which subsequently conveyed the PROJECT SITE to its wholly owned subsidiary 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC on April 6, 2023, with the transfer having been recorded at the County Auditor’s Office on April 14, 2023. In addition, the PROJECT SITE has been revised to be Parcel Number 495-318337 (split from the ORIGINAL PARCEL) containing approximately 23.713 +/- acres of undeveloped land.  The legal description, per the Franklin County Auditor, is listed as Lockbourne Rd, R22 T3 S2, 23.713 +/- acres with the current street address of 6730 Prushing Farms Road, Columbus, Ohio 43137. This street address may or may not change upon PROJECT completion.  \n \nDue diligence has been undertaken by the CITY in that 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC has agreed to fully assume the terms and commitments of the ENTERPRISE pursuant to the AGREEMENT, has submitted an updated Economic Development Incentive Application, the five-hundred dollars ($500.00) Amendment Fee and that this application and all other pertinent information has been reviewed and vetted.  \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to (1) remove Pinchal & Company LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, whereby 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC will assume the terms and commitments of the AGREEMENT, (2) revise the description of the PROJECT SITE, (3) to revise the Project's expected start and completion dates within Section 1 of the Agreement, and (4) to revise the exemption window in Section 3 of the AGREEMENT, and (5) to revise the notice information related to ENTERPRISE within Section 8 of the AGREEMENT.    \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement for a the first time for Assignment & Assumption with 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC, to remove Pinchal & Company LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT and to be replaced with 6730 Prushing Farms, LLC as ENTERPRISE and party to the AGREEMENT, to modify project and exemption dates, redefine the PROJECT SITE, and revise the notice information.  \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS,                     the City of Columbus (“CITY”) entered into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “AGREEMENT”) with Pinchal & Company LLC (“ENTERPRISE”), approved by Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”) by Ordinance No. 2948-2021, passed May 9, 2022, with this AGREEMENT made and entered into effective August 15, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS,                     the AGREEMENT granted a 75%/10-Year abatement on real property improvements; and\n \nWHEREAS, the incentive was granted in consideration of a proposed total capital investment of approximately $16,077,439, which included approximately $871,719 in acquisition costs, $869,720 in leasehold improvements and $14,336,000 in real property improvements to construct a proactive industrial distribution and warehouse facility consisting of approximately 286,720 square-feet on an undeveloped land containing approximately 182 +/- acres south of State Route 317 on Lockbourne Road, Columbus, Ohio 43137, Parcel Number 495-263119 (the “ORIGINAL PARCEL”), building #4, legislated as Pinchal & Company LLC Building 1 within the City of Columbus and within the City of Columbus Enterprise Zone (the “PROJECT SITE”).
