    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify an existing grant agreement with the Scioto Peninsula Association, Inc. (SPA), a non-profit corporate entity managed by the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, to provide funding for additional security personnel within the Scioto Peninsula development area. \n \nOrdinance 3168-2022 authorized the execution of a grant agreement between the City, acting through the Director of Public Service, and the SPA, to facilitate the implementation of various security enhancement programs in the Scioto Peninsula area intended to increase public safety and to support growth and development in that area. The primary purpose of that grant award was to subsidize the cost associated with the use of unarmed security personnel in order to establish a visible security presence in the Scioto Peninsula. \n \nRecent security concerns at the Starling Street North and South garages have prompted SPA to recommend increasing security staffing in those facilities. The Department of Public Service has committed $20,000.00 to subsidize the cost of additional security patrols there for 8 hours per day through the end of the year. The purpose of this legislation is to authorize a modification to the aforementioned grant agreement to facilitate the provision of needed safety services.     \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, which manages the SPA, is CC010217, which expires on June 8, 2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $20,000.00 is available within Fund 6500, the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund, for this expenditure. \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is not subject to the MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements.  \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency legislation is requested in order to allow increased security patrols to commence as soon as reasonably practicable to address an uptick in criminal activity in the Scioto Peninsula area. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to modify an existing grant agreement with the Scioto Peninsula Association to provide funding for additional security patrols in the Scioto Peninsula area; to authorize an expenditure of up to $20,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($20,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, which manages the Scioto Peninsula Association (SPA), is overseeing the redevelopment of the Scioto Peninsula, which will culminate in the construction of various residential, office, and commercial developments; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service previously agreed to partner with the SPA to facilitate the implementation of various security enhancement programs in the Scioto Peninsula area intended to increase public safety and to support growth and development in that area; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3168-2022 authorized the execution of a grant agreement between the Department of Public Service and the SPA, pursuant to which the City agreed to subsidize the cost of utilizing unarmed security personnel in order to establish a visible security presence in the Scioto Peninsula; and\n \nWHEREAS, recent security concerns at the Starling Street North and South garages have prompted the SPA to recommend increasing security staffing in those facilities; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service has committed $20,000.00 to subsidize the cost of additional security patrols there for 8 hours per day through the end of the year, making it necessary to modify the existing grant agreement; and  \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute the requisite modification in order to allow increased security patrols to commence as soon as reasonably practicable to address an uptick in criminal activity in the Scioto Peninsula area, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service is hereby authorized to modify an existing grant agreement with the Scioto Peninsula Association and to provide funding for additional security patrols in the Scioto Peninsula area.\n \nSECTION 2.
