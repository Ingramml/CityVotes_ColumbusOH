    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Columbus Regional Airport Authority (CRAA) asking that the City extinguish the right-of-way and transfer the asset of a 2.851 +/- acre portion of right-of-way from the Department of Public Service to the Columbus Regional Airport Authority to be combined with Parcel 010-146775.  Right-of-way area is shown as a grid patterned section within the Parcel 010-146775.  This portion of right-of-way is adjacent to and within a parcel already owned by the CRAA (Columbus Regional Airport Authority)  PID  010-146775.  The portion of right-of-way abuts 17th Avenue to the north; International Gateway runs east/west directionally through the portion to the north; Selzer Road is east of the portion; and Johnstown Road is west of the portion.\n \nIt is necessary to extinguish the right-of-way and transfer the asset to CRAA.  This right-of-way is within CRAA's parcel (PID 010-146775) boundaries and should not exist as City right-of-way but should be under the control of Columbus Regional Airport Authority.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by extinguishing this right-of-way and transferring the asset to CRAA.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the asset as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way. \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on June 17, 2021.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to CRAA at no cost to them.\n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:\nThe City will receive no funds for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo extinguish a 2.851 acre portion of right-of-way adjacent to and within a parcel already owned by the Columbus Regional Airport Authority and transfer the asset to Columbus Regional Airport Authority.
