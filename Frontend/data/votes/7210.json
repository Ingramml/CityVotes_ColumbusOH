    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Arts Foundation of Olde Towne, Inc., in support of the Hot Times Community Arts & Music Festival.\n \nHot Times is a 47 year old Community event that has seen a lot of transition in its decades. Grown from a neighborhood flea market to a beloved, three-day long community event, the festival has called 240 Parsons Avenue home since 1989. \n \nIn the past, funding for the event has come from the OAC, GCAC, and the National Endowment for the Arts Challenge America Grant, the United Way and the Ohio Arts & Humanities Council. In those years the event could give small honorarium for the artists. In recent years much of that funding has dried up and the Festival has not been able to honor performers with any monetary funding. Still they came and they played for the Community because they see the importance of the bridge this event builds within the City. There is no other festival like Hot Times. This event bridges cultures, incomes, and lifestyles and creates a celebration place for all people, lifestyles and cultures. The event collaborates with Central Community House to produce the Columbus Children's Parade and with other small community partners.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide the Arts Foundation with funding in advance of the Festival. The organizers require funding on hand for the performance, and it is unlikely that the City would be able to accommodate that need via a non-emergency ordinance given the anticipated date of the Festival.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Arts Foundation of Olde Towne, Inc., in support of the Hot Times Community Arts & Music Festival; to authorize an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($10,400.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Hot Times is a 47 year old Community event that has seen a lot of transition in its decades; and\n \nWHEREAS, grown from a neighborhood flea market to a beloved, three-day long community event, the festival has called 240 Parsons Avenue home since 1989; and\n \nWHEREAS, this event bridges cultures, incomes, and lifestyles and creates a celebration place for all people, lifestyles and cultures; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily business of the city in that it is immediately necessary to authorize a grant agreement in order to provide the Arts Foundation with funding in advance of the Festival; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1: That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the Arts Foundation of Olde Towne, Inc. in support of the Hot Times Community Arts & Music Festival.\n \nSECTION 2: That per the action authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $10,400.00 is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4: That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 5: That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
