    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing indefinite quantity contract with API Security Services for security services at City of Columbus pools, sports facilities and other locations as needed. The initial contract is not to exceed $50,000.00.  The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is an increase of $50,000.00 for an aggregate maximum obligation of $100,000.00.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department utilizes the Columbus Police Department for all security needs when possible.  If there are needs that exceed the ability of CPD to assist then private security companies are scheduled to fulfill those needs.  API is currently the primary back up security service for all pool, athletic complex and other facilities operated by the Recreation and Parks Department.  Due to heightened security concerns at the outdoor pools and difficulty in filling all openings through the police department, additional private security officers are needed.  An additional $50,000.00 will ensure that all facilities are secured.\n \nSecurity services for 2023 were bid out on RFQ023932.  One vendor responded, Community Crime Patrol, and a contract has been authorized with them.  However they are unable to cover all of the additional need.  API was sourced locally subsequent to the RFQ and they have provided competitive hourly rates.  Finding reliable security continues to be a challenge for the Recreation and Parks Dept.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nAPI Security Services \n867 High Street Ste D\nWorthington, OH 43085 \nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 007115, 35-2158980\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure that Recreation and Parks facilities continue to operate safely during the summer season and for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will modify the previously authorized amount by $50,000.00.  $50,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $100,000.00.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with API Security Services for security services at City of Columbus pools, sports facilities and other locations, to authorize the transfer of $60,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund, to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with API Security Services for security services at City of Columbus pools, sports facilities and other locations; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the transfer of $60,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists to public safety such that it is immediately necessary to ensure that Recreation and Parks facilities continue to operate safely during the summer season and for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
