    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for professional engineering services with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Blueprint 5th x Northwest Sunrise/Glenn CIP #650870-109151 and Sunrise/Glenn Water Line Improvements CIP# 690236-100118, in an amount up to $459,272.20.\n \nTo date, the consultant has conducted the required field investigations, property investigations, hydraulic modeling & alternative analysis to determine the preferred alternative.  The consulting team used this data to prepare two sets of contract drawings for the two components comprising the preferred alternative, which consist of bio retention areas within the right-of-way (CC drawings) and permeable pavement (Dr. E drawings).  \n \nFuture work will consist of assisting in the preparation of the construction bid documents and specifications, bidding the work, and performing engineering services during construction for the construction of the bio retention areas, permeable pavement, lateral lining, and roof redirection work associated with this project area.  \n \nPlanning areas for this project is “42 - Fifth by Northwest”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $459,272.20\n                     Original Contract                                  $ 1,043,247.72 (ORD 2107-2016 PO027435)\n                     Renewal #1                                                 $ 1,257,388.86 (ORD 0252-2020 PO221919)\n                     Modification 1                                          $      24,991.27 (ORD 1882-2021 PO287988)\n                     Modification 2                                          $    459,272.20 (Current)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                          $ 2,784,900.05\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant. In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nA cost estimate for the proposed scope of work was prepared by Burgess & Niple and reviewed by DOSD.  The total renewal includes total labor cost (direct labor multiplied by the hourly cost multiplier). These prices were agreed upon with the previous modifications and were not to exceed the maximum labor rates established. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project is being completed as part of the City’s Blueprint Columbus program.  This project will construct various types of green infrastructure (GI) throughout the neighborhood which will provide a higher water quality within the region by treating the surface runoff before it discharges to the waterways.  The project will also rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer laterals and install or redirect new roof downspouts so as to reduce inflow and infiltration (I&I) within the sanitary sewer system which will result in fewer water in basements (WIBs), reduced sanitary sewer flows and decreased sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).\n \nCommunity outreach is big part of these projects and the initial public meetings have been held.  Subsequent meetings with other interested, neighborhood committees have also been held to inform them of the potential changes.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nBurgess & Niple, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004425 and expires 2/9/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Burgess & Niple, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Burgess & Niple, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Burgess & Niple, Inc. anticipates performing all of the work on this contract modification.\n \nThe certification of Burgess & Niple, Inc. was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5. FISCAL IMPACT\nAn amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects. Amendments to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget are contingent upon approval of the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget.  Funds also need to be transferred between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, and the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006 to align cash with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget;
