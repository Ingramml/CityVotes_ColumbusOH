    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Resource International, Inc., for construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities construction projects bid during the calendar years 2023 through 2025 as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contracts.  \n \nThe construction project to be administered by Resource International, Inc. under this contract modification is CIP #690236-100097, South Weyant Avenue Water Line Improvements.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Community Planning Area “57 - Mid East”.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $99,810.09\nOriginal Contract:                               $540,123.70 (ORD 0200-2023; PO319886, PO384348, PO384351)\nModification #1:                                   $99,810.09 (This ordinance)\n                     Total                               $639,933.79\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025 and modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 0200-2023.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\n \nThe project was impacted by a six month long delay from the notice to proceed date to the actual date that the construction started due to a manufacturer driven delay in supplying the Ductile Iron pipe. The delay caused Resource to have to shift the staff chosen to manage and inspect the project, which impacted the budget through higher labor rates. Also, the productivity of the construction company working on this project has impacted the inspection budget, as the proposed construction schedule extends all the way to the revised contractual completion date (9/26/2023).\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis work will ensure the Department’s construction projects are performed correctly and will last the anticipated service life.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nResource International, Inc. contract compliance number is CC-004197 and expires 5/31/2025.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  Resource International, Inc. is classified as a WBE company by ODI.  Per the Utilization Plan included with this ordinance, Resource International, Inc. does not plan to use any subconsultants for this work so the MBE/WBE participation for this task will be 100%.\nResource International, Inc.’s certification was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are appropriated and available within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project. Amendments to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget are contingent upon approval of the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget. A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Resource International, Inc. for the South Weyant Avenue Water Line Improvements Project; and to expend up to $99,810.09 from the Water Bond Fund for the modification.  ($99,810.09) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities advertised a Request for Proposals for Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services; and\n \nWHEREAS, Resource International, Inc. was one of six firms selected by the evaluation committee to provide these services; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0200-2023 authorized the contract with Resource International, Inc. for these services and assigned the first task to be performed; and\n \nWHEREAS, an additional construction inspection/administration task needs to be performed; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract with Resource International, Inc. will need to be modified to add this task to the contract and to add funding to pay for the task; and \n \nWHEREAS, an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund to align cash and appropriation with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds must be expended to pay for the construction administration and inspection services Resource International provides under the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change \n6006 / 690236-100176 / Wilson Ave Area Water Line Improvements (Voted Water Carryover) / $460,000.00 / $360,190.00 / ($99,810.00)\n  \n6006 / 690236-100097 / South Weyant Avenue Water Line Improvements (Voted Water Carryover) / $0.00 / $99,810.00 / $99,810.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That the transfer of funds and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund, Fund 6006, is authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of Public Utilities is authorized to enter into a contract with Resource International, Inc., 6350 Presidential Gateway, Columbus, Ohio, 43231, for construction administration and inspection services, in accordance with the terms and conditions as shown in the contract on file with the Department of Public Utilities, in an amount not to exceed $99,810.09.\n \nSECTION 4.
