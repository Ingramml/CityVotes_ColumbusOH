    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with CESO, Inc. for the Turnberry Golf Course Improvements Design Project. The contract amount is $72,400.00, with a contingency of $34,500.00, for a total of $106,900.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Turnberry Golf Course, bordering Blacklick Creek, is an Arthur Hills designed links style championship course. This course hosts many local youth tournaments, provides learning opportunities for all ages, and is open to the public. Revenues generated through greens fees, cart rentals, tournaments, rentals, and concession sales support the operation of the golf courses. Currently there are many areas throughout Turnberry Golf Course that hold water and need improved drainage, along with improvements to user circulation throughout the course. Improvements to the course will encourage increased use and revenue.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 19, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 11, 2021.  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nCESO, Inc. (MAJ)\nCarpenter Marty Transportation (MAJ)\nSuhail (MBE)\n \nOf note, professional services contracts are quality based selections and not based on price.

Additionally, the parking, circulation, and staging area in the front of the clubhouse will see significant improvements allowing for people to more easily access the course.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: This site hosts various junior tournaments and the Central Ohio High School Sectional Golf Tournament. Golfers demand that the playing surfaces be in satisfactory condition, especially when competing in tournaments.\n \nArea(s) Affected: South East (65)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan by improving revenue producing amenities.
