    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with HDR Engineering, Inc. for professional services for the SWWTP Biofilter Cold Weather Reliability Improvements project, CIP #650352-100008, in an amount up to $712,102.10. \n \nThis project will provide preliminary design services for upgrades and improvements to the existing Odor Control Facility (OCF), the carbon Biotower and ventilation system serving the Sludge Loadout Building (SLB), and to the foul air fans at the Gravity Thickening Building (GTB) to improve odor control. These improvements will provide active ventilation, prevent corrosion, reduce foul air, and provide an Interconnector Junction Chamber (IJC) Odor Improvement Report on the IJC regarding the probability of success using existing OCF equipment to improve odor reduction or design a separate odor control facility for the IJC under a future contract.\n \nTwo future modifications to this contract are anticipated. The first modification will be for Step 2 - Detailed Design Services and will provide bidding and contract documents for the construction phase of this project. The second modification will be for Step 3 - Services during construction which includes technical field representation and other services throughout the construction phase of the project. \n \nThe planning area for this project is 64 - Far South.\n \nTIMELINE:  The total term for the original contract will be for 270 days from the Notice to Proceed until on or around May 31, 2024, at which time a modification for Step 2 - Detailed Design Services will be requested. Upon completion of Step 2 - Detailed Design Services, a second modification will be requested for Step 3 - Services during construction.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The proposed award amount is $712,102.10, including a 10% contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  Two future contract modifications are anticipated for Step 2 - Detailed Design Services and Step 3 - Services during construction.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract                                                                        $712,102.10\n                     Modification #1 (future)                                          $1,221,000.00\n                     Modification #2 (future)                                          $1,221,000.00\n                      CONTRACT TOTAL                                          $3,154,120.10\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe Odor Control Facility (OCF) has served the SWWTP for approximately 10 years; however recently SWWTP staff have expressed concerns about the increased maintenance of the facilities and questioned the overall system performance. An evaluation was performed and identified improvements to the OCF necessary to ensure continued performance and alleviate some of the increasing maintenance costs. The biofilters at the Influent Flow Structure have several areas with corrosion and cracking of concrete where the water is pooling. There is also deteriorating pipe due to UV exposure. The carbon biotower near the Sludge Loadout Building (SLB) is in a state of disrepair and in need of upgrade improvements. The foul air fans for the SLB are old and at the end of their useful life and need to be replaced. The Interconnector Junction Chamber (IJC) control gates are in a state of disrepair due to hydrogen sulfide gas corrosion of the metal, therefore improvements to the ventilation and hydrogen sulfide treatment are warranted. The repair and upgrade of each areas within this project will provide better, more reliable odor control and removal of environmentally hazardous gasses. \n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 1/9/23.   Two proposals were received:\n \nName                                               C.C.
