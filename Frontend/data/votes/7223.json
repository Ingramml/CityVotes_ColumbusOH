The Secondary process is a crucial process in treating wastewater and keeping our community and rivers clean. This process is one of the final steps in the treatment process for the wet stream and removes biological settle-able solids to reduce harmful parameters in the plants final effluent. Failure of this equipment would cease collection of the settle-able solids in the secondary clarifiers, which would then fill with solids that would overflow from the secondary tanks and eventually end up in the effluent, ultimately resulting in a violation and potential hazards.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 4/24/23.   Three proposals were received:\n \nName                                               C.C.
