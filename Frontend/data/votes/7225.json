BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract renewal for professional engineering/architectural services with Dynotec, Inc for the General Architectural Services - Division of Water 2021 project, CIP #690542-100002, in an amount up to $400,000.\n \nThis contract establishes task order-based professional services to augment existing technical support personnel within the Division of Water on an as-authorized, as-needed basis in order to accomplish a wide range of work that may include but is not limited to planning, design, and construction phase architectural services. \n \nThis ordinance will authorize a renewal in the amount of $400,000.00 for the estimated architectural needs of the Water Supply Group starting the third quarter of 2023 until the contract scope is completed to the satisfaction of the City.  This is the first contract renewal.  One more renewal to this agreement is anticipated in first quarter of 2024.\n \nTasks completed or in-progress under the original contract include:\n•                     An evaluation and detailed design for HCWP Door Lock Improvements\n•                     An evaluation and improvements project of 910 Loading Dock\n•                     An evaluation of space needs for 910 Dublin Rd \n \nThe Planning Area is “99-Citywide” as tasks will be performed on City projects all over the City.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:  General Architectural Services for the Water Supply Group will be provided under a task order-based professional services agreement.  As stated in Ordinance 2975-2021, the original contract was to have two renewals.  This modification is anticipated to be executed in the third quarter of 2023 to provide funds for projects until all funds are expended.  The second modification/renewal is planned to be executed at that point.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $400,000.00\nThe original contract amount was $300,000.00.  There are two programmed modifications/renewals of $400,000.00 each.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract (PO308147, Ord. No. 2975-2021)                                                 $300,000.00\nRenewal #1 (current ordinance)                                                                                                  $400,000.00\nRenewal #2 (future)                                                                                                                            $400,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                   $1,100,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original professional services agreement was bid out and planned for a total of two contract modifications/renewals. The original agreement was executed in January 2022 to provide funds for approximately a one year period or until all funds are expended.  As of July 1, 2023 the original contract was still active as there were still funds in PO308147.  This is the first renewal.\n \n1.3. How cost of renewal was determined:\nThe cost was determined by taking the estimated renewal amount from the initial contract legislation ($300k) and increasing it to account for updated DOW project needs and inflation.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project will help the Division of Water renovate/upgrade facilities that are essential components in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water is essential to economic growth and development.\n \nPublic outreach may occur for some of the projects to be managed under this contract depending on the nature of the work and impacts to the public.\n \n3.
