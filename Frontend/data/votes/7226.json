Renewal #1 was funded for a approximately one year or until all funds are expended.  Renewal #1 (PO340668) was approved on August 12, 2022, the contract is within the one year period.  This is the last renewal.\n \n1.3.

MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Prime AE Group, Inc. was classified as an MBE company by the City’s Office of Diversity at the time of contract award but is currently classified as an MAJ company.  Their spend will count as an MBE under this contract due to their classification status when the contract was implemented.  Prime AE Group, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract renewal with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this renewal is not possible to calculate at this time since it is unknown which tasks the subconsultants will work on for the upcoming contract period.                                          \n                                          \nAs part of their proposal, Dynotec, Inc has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nCTL Engineering                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Inc.      Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nResource International                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nLerch Bates, Inc.                                                                     Dublin, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\n \nThe certification of Prime AE Group, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the contract renewal was executed.\n \n 5.
