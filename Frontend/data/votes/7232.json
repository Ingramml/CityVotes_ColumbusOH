    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to enter into grant agreements with recipients of the Department of Development, Division of Housing’s Critical Home Repair Program and to make payments directly to the contractor who performed the work.  The Department desires to encumber $120,000.00 of bond funds for this program and will enter into multiple agreements under the authority of this ordinance.\n \nThe Critical Home Repair Program is open to households up to 80% AMI with the exception of participants in the Better Municipal Care for Veterans Program which may go up to 120% AMI.  Households apply and if the application is approved, then City staff write the specifications for the project and publicly advertise through Bid Express.  The homeowner makes a selection from the bids received that are within 15% of the estimate prepared by the City.  The City then enters into a grant agreement with the homeowner, the homeowner signs the contract with the contractor, but the City pays the contractor directly.\n \nCritical Home Repair projects include things like roofs, windows (as necessary for security purposes) and doors, and mechanical repairs for emergency situations (i.e. faulty/dangerous electric, no heat, clogged sewer mains).  As the program has evolved, the department has learned that some critical home repair projects are more involved than originally expected, resulting in additional costs unanticipated by the homeowner, City, and the contractor.  As such, the Director is also seeking authority to modify Critical Home Repair contracts as issues are discovered, up to the amount of funds remaining on the ACPO.  This will allow the department to immediately authorize the additional work needed without stopping work to seek Council approval for a contract modification.\n \nThis is a long standing program provided by the Division of Housing and approval will be requested, as needed, to continue funding the program. \n \nEmergency action is requested to provide needed funding to prevent disruption in the Critical Home Repair Program and to continue performing critical repairs for residents most in need.\n \nFiscal Impact: $120,000.00 is available in the 2022 Capital Improvement Budget, Taxable bond fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Amendments to the capital budget are contingent upon passage of the 2023 Capital Improvements budget.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $120,000.00 of Taxable Bonds; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into multiple grant agreements with recipients of the Department of Development, Division of Housing’s Critical Home Repair Program and to make payments directly to the contractor who performed the work; to modify grant agreements funded from this ordinance as necessary to complete the project; and to declare an emergency.
