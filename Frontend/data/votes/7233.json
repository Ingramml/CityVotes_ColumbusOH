    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes III LLC to develop 30 units of new construction rental and rehab housing; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation will allow the Director to enter into a Housing Development Agreement with Healthy Linden Homes III LLC, which will ultimately be funded with $5,000,000.00 from a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond. Upon passage of the 2023 Capital Budget and when funds become available, an ordinance will be brought to Council to authorize a grant agreement.\n \nHealthy Linden Homes III LLC is an affordable housing developer, focused on increasing the stock of high-quality housing options available to families earning no more than 80% of Area Median Income (AMI) in Linden. Healthy Linden Homes III LLC seeks to further address Columbus’s housing affordability issues by developing 30 units of new construction rental and rehab housing in zip code 43211. These properties will consist of infill development, designed to replace residential structures that have been demolished. Additionally, the parcels that have been identified for redevelopment are being acquired exclusively from the City of Columbus and Franklin County Land Banks.\n \nThe 30 rental units for which we are seeking funding will consist of 4 single family homes and 13 duplexes. Most of these properties will be built by Unibilt Industries-a modular home builder located in Dayton, Ohio. The modular units will be delivered approximately 75% complete and set on full foundations. Healthy Linden Homes III LLC has engaged a General Contractor who will complete all site preparations, construct the foundations and manage the balance of work post-delivery. Once delivered, the units will require mechanical connections for electric, plumbing and HVAC. Porches will be constructed on site, and there will be some minor interior finishes to finalize. Lastly, the General Contractor will pour concrete parking pads and walkways, and each site will be fully landscaped with sod and a shade tree.  Upon completion, these projects will blend with the existing fabric of the community, and there will be no visible evidence to suggest that they are modular in nature.  The units that are not modular are one rehab and traditional stick construction.\n \nIn addition to high-quality, affordable places to call home, the tenant families who will reside in these units will have access to a variety of supportive services and advocacy opportunities. Healthy Linden Homes III LLC hired a full-time Tenant Services Coordinator to link residents and health/social service providers and Nationwide Children’s Healthy Neighborhoods Healthy Families (HNHF) programming. The Tenant Services Coordinator will work to increase the health knowledge and self-sufficiency of tenant families through outreach, community education, referrals to community resources, social support, and advocacy. More specifically, tenants will have improved access to health, educational, workforce, and life skills development opportunities. Financial literacy, parenting classes, and mental health services will also be emphasized. Service engagement will not be required for Healthy Homes’ families, but it will be available to all households as needed.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the construction schedule and to fulfill financing needs prior to closing deadlines with the developer’s other lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is needed.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 045790 and expires June 21, 2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes III LLC to develop 30 units of new construction rental and rehab housing; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \n      WHEREAS, the Director of Development seeks to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes III LLC; and\n \nWHEREAS, the HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and future availability of funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing $5,000,000.00 of bond funds from a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation would authorize the Director of Development to first execute the HDA and pending the availability of funding from a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond the department will seek City Council’s approval to enter into a grant agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development to pass this ordinance as emergency in order to maintain the construction schedule and to fulfill financing needs prior to closing deadlines with the developer’s other lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it., thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Director of the Department of Development is authorized to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Healthy Linden Homes III LLC.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
