    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  In 2021, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office launched the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention pilot program. Through this Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant funded pilot, low-income residents have access to free vehicle safety light repairs. These free repair services keep drivers, passengers and pedestrians safer on the roads and help prevent low-income residents from receiving tickets for safety code violations. This pilot is a partnership between the Columbus City Attorney’s Office (CAO) and Columbus Division of Police. \n \nTo ensure consistent and ready access to quality repair services for program participants, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office worked through Columbus States Automotive Advisory Board to identify accredited auto shops interested in serving as repair partners for the pilot. Interested parties were vetted to ensure their capacity to meet project terms and requirements as defined by the CAO, the grantor and included in the City of Columbus’ standard service contract. Through this process, CAO entered into contract with Lindsay Honda and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care for repair services. \n \nThe Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant account (G24220) has a balance of $488.01. This legislation requests a $488.01 modification to Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care’s $38,000 service contract (PO299839; PO349838) to support grant objectives. This ordinance shall be in effect within thirty days from the date of passage.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This contract modification is funded through a 2021 Department of Justice’s Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant sub-award from Franklin County Board of Commissioners’ Office of Justice Policy and Programs (ordinance 1384-2022).
