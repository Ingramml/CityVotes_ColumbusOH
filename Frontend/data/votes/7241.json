    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Public Safety Director to enter into contract for the second year of a three-year agreement with SoundThinking Inc., formerly ShotSpotter Inc,. to continue a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis program. Ordinance 1644-2022, amended by ordinance 2543-2022 passed October 3, 2022, established a three-year agreement with ShotSpotter, a subscription based service that involves the installation of a gunfire sensor network in areas identified by the City. These sensors connect to a cloud-based data center infrastructure, providing a 24/7/365 gunfire monitoring service within a twelve (12) square-mile radius of the installed sensor infrastructure.\nIn addition to gunfire detection, the SoundThinking service will notify law enforcement agencies of gunfire incidents and direct them to the precise location of gunfire. The service also offers the capability to instantly notify officers of shootings in progress with real-time data delivered to dispatch officers, patrol cars, and smart phones. The alerts are intended to improve police response to incidents of gunfire, enhance officer safety, speed aid to victims, assist in investigations and the collection of evidence, and ultimately, the apprehension of dangerous offenders. The original contract for services with SoundThinking, formerly ShotSpotter dated October 4, 2018 was established by ordinance 2151-2018.\nBecause of the established relationship with this contractor and the fact that they have technology in place at the required locations to interface with Columbus police equipment, it was not practical to bid out this service and incur start-up fees and breaks in coverage.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested in order to provide continuity to the gunfire detection program without any interruption after expiration of the first year.  \nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $840,000.00 from the General Fund with SoundThinking Inc, formerly ShotSpotter, Inc. for a gunfire location, alert, and analysis system. These funds are available within the 2023 General Fund budget. $685,000.00 was encumbered in 2018 and spent in 2019, $1,388,548.56 was encumbered in 2020 and spent in 2020 and finally $630,000.00 was encumbered in 2020 and spent into 2021.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Public Safety Director to enter into contract for the second year of a three-year agreement with SoundThinking Inc., formerly ShotSpotter, Inc. to continue the use of a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis program; to authorize the expenditure of $840,000.00 from the General Fund and to declare an emergency. ($840,000.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety has determined to continue the use of the gunfire detection, alert, and analysis service to assist law enforcement responding to incidents of gunfire in Columbus neighborhoods; and,\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety needs to encumber funds for the 2nd year of a three-year agreement and ensure that funds are available for payment; and,\nWHEREAS, this agreement covers a total radius of 12 square miles; and,\nWHEREAS, SoundThinking can deliver instant, accurate tactical awareness to the Division of Police including precise location anywhere within the coverage area including latitude/longitude and street address, exact time and number of rounds fired and shooter position, speed and direction of travel; and,\nWHEREAS, because of the established relationship with this contractor and the fact that they have technology in place at the required locations to interface with Columbus police equipment, it was not practical to bid out this service and incur start-up fees and breaks in coverage; and,\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, to provide the funds needed for this year's gunshot detection agreement and avoid any interruption in services, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Public Safety Director is hereby authorized to enter into contract for the second year of a three-year service agreement with SoundThinking, Inc. for a gunfire detection, alert, and analysis system and to provide the capability of the system to be integrated with existing City technology infrastructure in order to adequately capture, layer, and share data across technology platforms.\n \nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $840,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within Fund 1000 General Fund, from Dept-Div 30-3003 Public Safety-Division of Police,  Object Class 03 - Contractual Services per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 3. The City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
