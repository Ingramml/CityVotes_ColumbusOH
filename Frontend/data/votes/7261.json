BACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) to enter into a Grant Agreement with the North Market Development Authority, Inc., an Ohio nonprofit corporation (NMDA, hereinafter the “Grantee”). The Department of Development will submit for City Council consideration, all necessary legislation to authorize the Director to enter into one or more subsequent agreements with the Grantee to authorize City grants not to exceed the amount of nine hundred fifty thousand dollars ($950,000) to be distributed over the course of three (3) consecutive years to help mitigate the business disruption to the North Market and the small businesses operating there. Four hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($475,000) is to be dispersed in 2023, three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000) in 2024, and up to one hundred twenty five thousand dollars ($125,000) in 2025. \n \nOn Franklin County Auditor Tax Parcel ID 010-054645, the City owns and leases to the Grantee a longstanding public market in Columbus that is an incubator and innovator of small businesses while providing the residents local products and cultural vibrancy (the “North Market”). Recently, remediation and construction activities began on and adjacent to the City-owned neighboring Franklin County Auditor Tax ID Parcel 010-307276, specifically at the location of the Grantee’s previous leased parking lot. Patrons of the North Market have been using alternate parking provided in a parking facility on Vine Street and then navigating around closed sidewalks. Also, the main entrance of the North Market located on the east side of the building was closed, which has limited access to the entrance on the Park Street side of the North Market. Construction activities are expected to continue through 2026, which will impact the continued operation of the North Market by the Grantee as well as impact its vendors and patrons.\n \n2.
