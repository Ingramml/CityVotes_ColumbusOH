    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Economic and Community Development - 3P GE North Market.\nOrdinance 0577-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. for the Economic and Community Development - 3P GE North Market project.  The contract is focused on utility relocations in the Arena and Convention Center Districts of the City around the existing North Market building.  This area was the subject of a utilities master plan that will be used for the basis of the scope of improvements.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,000.000.00.\n \nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to complete the overall project and the City’s commitment in the executed Economic Development Agreement for the North Market due to unexpected archaeological monitoring and investigation of construction activities related to the North Graveyard. This modification will provide additional funding to complete the streetscape design.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $   750,000.00     (PO265378, Ord. 0577-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1                                                                                    $1,000,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $1,750,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. is CC004467 and expires 2/22/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,000,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. Funds are appropriated.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL \nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n                     \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Korda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc. in connection with the Economic and Community Development - 3P GE North Market project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project.  ($1,000,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
