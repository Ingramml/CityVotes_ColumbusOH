with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA).  This loan program is jointly administered by the Ohio EPA’s Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance (DEFA) and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 1107-2022, passed by Council on 5/9/22.  This loan is anticipated to be approved in July of 2023. \n \nA transfer of funds from the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund, Fund 6011, in the amount of $3,164,800.00 is needed to fund construction for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the Ohio EPA to reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  Amendments to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget are contingent upon approval of the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget.\n \nCash and appropriation in the amount of $2,000.00 will need to be transferred between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Water System Reserve Fund to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter
