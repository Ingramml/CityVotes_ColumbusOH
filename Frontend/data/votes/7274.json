    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for additional preliminary engineering services with ms consultants, inc. for the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project, CIP #690502-100001, in an amount up to $1,487,278.00.\n \nThis contract is for additional engineering consulting services for the design of water transmission mains that will be constructed in conjunction with the construction of the City’s future fourth water plant. The transmission mains will extend from the fourth water plant located at 5992 Home Road, Delaware, OH 43015, to a strategic connection points in the City’s existing water distribution system, specifically the Cleveland/Henderson pressure district.  \n \nThe initial contract, Phase 1, is for preliminary design services.  This current modification is to add preliminary engineering services for new Scioto River/Griggs Reservoir crossing(s) into the Cleveland/Henderson pressure districts and associated transmission main alignment(s) to connect the Fourth Water Plant transmission mains.  The existing waterlines crossing the Scioto River do not have the capacity to convey flows from the future Fourth Water Plant, based on projected plant capacity.  \n \nThere are two additional planned contract modifications.  One contract modification will be for Phase 2, detailed design services.  The final planned contract modification will be for Phase 3, engineering services during construction.\n \nThe majority of the transmission main will be located outside the City of Columbus.  The portion within the City of Columbus will be located within the Hayden Run Planning Area (30) and the Far Northwest Planning Area (31).  The Citywide Planning Area (99) will be used for the accounting template due to the project covering multiple areas.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:  The duration of the initial contract for Phase 1 - Preliminary Design Services is 18 months and is expected to begin in January, 2023.  The additional preliminary engineering services being added under the current modification will have the same schedule as the original contract for Phase 1 services.  Phase 2 - Detailed Design Services (Modification No. 1) is expected to have a duration of approximately 24 months.  Phase 3 - Engineering Services during Construction (Modification No. 2) is expected to have a duration of approximately 28 months.  \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,487,278.77\nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract (ORD 3235-2022; PO363148)                                                                 $5,399,068.91\nModification No.1 (Current)                                                                       $1,487,278.77 \nModification No. 2 (Future estimate)                                                                                $10,000,000.00 \nModification No. 3 (Future estimate)                                                                 $2,500,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                               $19,386,347.68 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nAt the time of the original contract, the initial and ultimate capacities for the future Fourth Water Plant were unknown and it was assumed that the existing Scioto River/Griggs Reservoir water main crossings would be able to convey these flows throughout the 30 year planning horizon.  Demand/growth projections were updated and the sizing of the Fourth Water Plant was determined, resulting in the need to add river crossing(s) sooner than previously anticipated to be able to convey an adequate volume of flow from the Fourth Water Plant in to the Cleveland/Henderson pressure district.  As ms consultants inc. is familiar with the project it was deemed necessary to continue with the same consultant in order to ensure the expediency of the project\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nms consutlants, inc. provided a cost proposal as requested by the City based on the scope of adding the river crossing(s) and associated transmission main(s) to the preliminary design of the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project.  The fee proposal was reviewed by the Division of Water deemed to be acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project has been scoped with a significant public outreach program.  This outreach program will include public meetings, advisory group briefings for stakeholders, development of a project website, fact sheets, pop-up engagement at neighborhood gatherings, e-newsletters, social media posts, and news releases.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION:  \nms consultants, inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006998 and expires 12/28/23.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against ms consultants, inc. or their subconsultants.\n \n4.
