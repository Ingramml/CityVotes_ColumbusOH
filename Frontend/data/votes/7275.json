    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract with KNS Services, Inc. for the Dublin Road Water Plant Miscellaneous Improvements (Camera System) project, CIP #690278-100000, in an amount of up to $260,000.00.  \n \nThe contract work includes replacing cameras at the Dublin Road Water Plant.  Work will include providing goods and services to remove existing cameras and cabling; installation of new cameras, cabling, and related appurtenances; and commissioning services.  \n \nThe work will be performed in Community Planning Area 68 - Dublin Road Corridor. \n \n1.1  Contract Amount\nThe contract amount is $260,000, which includes a contingency amount of $27,860 (approximately 12% of the quoted amount) to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nQuote Amount                                               $232,140.00\nContingency                                                 $27,860.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $260,000.00\n \n1.2  Timeline\nIt is anticipated the work will begin in September 2023 and be completed by December 31, 2023.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe DRWP provides potable water to a large portion of the City’s service areas and the camera system is an important tool for maintaining awareness of the plant environment and treatment process. Existing camera equipment at the DRWP is past its useful life, is experiencing issues, is no longer reliable, and needs to be replaced.  All work will be conducted within secure areas of the water plant that is not accessible to the public so no public meetings are anticipated.\n \n3.  SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT\nA quote for this work was obtained from KNS Services, Inc.  KNS is the only Genetec Unified Elite integrator in the central Ohio area.  Due to the proprietary nature of the security software and the need to maintain compatibility with the Genetec system for equipment already installed, it is in the best interest of the City to enter into a contract with KNS Services in accordance with the City’s sole source procurement provisions rather than incurring additional expense to replace the entire system. \n \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for KNS Services, Inc. is CC15885-151146 and expires 12/22/2017.  Contract compliance will need to be renewed before the contract can be executed.\n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal due to the proprietary nature of the equipment.  This contract was not implemented with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  The anticipated MBE/WBE spend for this project is 0.0%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, KNS Services has proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nHarris and Heavener Excavating                   Reynoldsburg, Ohio                                    MAJ\n \nThe certification of KNS Services is not in good standing at the time of this ordinance due to the expiration of their contract compliance with the City.  Contract compliance will need to be renewed before a contract can be executed.\n \n6. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nThis is a service contract.  Pre-qualification status is not required.\n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  Amendments to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget are contingent upon approval of the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget.  Cash and appropriation also need to be transferred between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n8.
