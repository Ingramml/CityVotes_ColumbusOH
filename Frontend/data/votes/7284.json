    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City has engaged in discussions with the business owner about their business practices, safety measures, and employee procedures, including involvement from the Columbus Division of Police to provide recommendations for security uplifts at the establishment.  These discussions have been memorialized into a nuisance abatement agreement between the City and the business owner, and includes requirements for security uplifts (cameras, lighting, hours of operation), employee training, and specific prohibitions on activity at the establishment.  The nuisance abatement agreement between the parties was reached in lieu of pursuing the outstanding objection, and the City reserves the right to object to their liquor license in the future or to bring the establishment into the Franklin County Environmental Court should they not comply.  The Division of Liquor Control requested that the City therefore withdraw this objection via resolution.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: This establishment has engaged in liquor sales on a temporary basis via the goodwill of the City and the Division of Liquor Control, but it does not yet have a valid 2023 liquor permit until the objection is withdrawn.  Now that the agreements are memorialized, and to facilitate the full, legal operation of liquor sales by business as soon as possible, the City requests passage of an emergency resolution.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo withdraw the objection to the renewal of liquor permit number 9294865 held by VM3015 INC, doing business as DOLL HOUSE & PATIO, located at 1680 Karl Court, Columbus, Ohio 43229; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Council previously objected to the renewal of liquor permit number 9294865 held by VM3015 INC, doing business as DOLL HOUSE & PATIO, located at 1680 Karl Court, Columbus, Ohio 43229, in Resolution 0240X-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, sufficient evidence from the Columbus Division of Police and the Columbus City Attorney’s office was presented to City Council in support of Resolution 0240X-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City has engaged in discussions with the business owner about their business practices, safety measures, and employee procedures, including involvement from the Columbus Division of Police to provide recommendations for security uplifts at the establishment; and\n \nWHEREAS, the nuisance abatement agreement between the parties was reached in lieu of pursuing the outstanding objection, and the City reserves the right to object to their liquor license in the future or to bring the establishment into Franklin County Environmental Court should they not comply; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Liquor Control requested that the City therefore withdraw this objection via resolution; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Council in that it needs to withdraw its objection that was made on December 5, 2022 pursuant to 4303.271 and 4303.292, Ohio Revised Code to the renewal of the liquor permit for DOLL HOUSE & PATIO, 1680 Karl Court, Columbus, Ohio 43229 to facilitate the full, legal operation of liquor sales by business as soon as possible; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
