    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Working with Recreation and Parks, the Real Estate Management Office engaged in a space planning project to assess Recreation and Parks office areas and staffing needs at 1111 East Broad Street to improve space utilization to accommodate current and projected increases in staffing.  A professional designer was retained to analyze existing space layouts, prepare a design plan, and to select appropriate office furnishings to be purchased to meet the needs of Recreation and Parks.  The Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids for office furniture in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding via RFQ024854. The City received three bid responses two of which were deemed eligible as follows:\n \nWorkspace Ohio LLC; DBA Dupler Office                                          $155,297.43\nTarazi LLC                                                                                                                              $982,891.00\n \nWorkspace Ohio LLC, DBA Dupler Office, City certified WBE, was responsive to all specifications, except they inadvertently responded with their standard price hold of thirty (30) days rather than the one hundred eighty (180) day price hold specified in RFQ024854.
