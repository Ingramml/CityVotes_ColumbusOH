    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with St. Mary School, Inc. for infrastructure improvements located at St. Mary School.\n \nSt. Mary School has experienced unprecedented growth over the last five years, increasing from 244 to nearly 400 students in pre-K through 8th grade for the 2020-2021 year. With increased enrollment comes crowded classrooms, well-worn facilities, and waitlists. However, as our enrollment grows, so does the opportunity to expand our impact. \n \nThe new campus will expand the elementary school by 10,000 sq. ft.; improve teaching and learning spaces with the latest technology and systems; provide outdoor learning environments; and provide dedicated space for partners to deliver programs and services. \n \nImproving rights of way and critical infrastructure such as sidewalks in historic neighborhoods is in alignment with the investments the city has made to improve and maintain essential and historic city assets. Columbus City Council deems it to be a public purpose to facilitate these infrastructure improvements, utility repairs and upgrades, and to provide for additional educational and recreation opportunities for residents. Columbus City Council also previously approved this intended expenditure via approval of the 2022 Capital Improvements Budget.\n \nThe total campaign goal is $20 million and, to date, more than $18.7 million has been raised. All except the $500,000 commitment from the City is private philanthropic support. The public investment of the City is leveraged by an unprecedented level of community support.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s contract compliance number is pending.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Development Taxable Bond Fund.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with St. Mary School, Inc.; to authorize the expenditure of $500,000.00 from the Development Taxable Bond Fund and to allow for expenditures prior to the Purchase Order.
