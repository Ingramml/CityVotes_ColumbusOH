    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), by Ordinance No. 1902-2015,  passed  July  27, 20 I 5,  authorized  the  City  of  Columbus  (“CITY”)  to  enter  into  an  Community  Reinvestment  Area Agreement  (the “AGREEMENT”) with  N.P.  Limited Partnership (“ENTERPRISE”) for a tax abatement of one-hundred percent (100%) for a period of ten (10) years in consideration of a proposed $24 million investment in real property improvements.  Additionally, the ENTERPRISE committed to creating approximately 708 full-time jobs with an associated annual payroll of  approximately  $45,489,000.00 upon full build-out and occupancy, and committed to relocate approximately 177 employees currently employed within the CITY related  to the construction of a series of buildings containing speculative office space (either primarily or as one component of mixed-use buildings) totaling approximately  177,000 square  feet  along  with  two  associated  600 space  parking  structures  (the \"PROJECT\") on  one  newly  expanded  parcel,  318-431-01-017-000 (recently  combined  from  the  two adjacent  parcels  318-431-01-017-000 and  318-431-01-013-003),  zip  code  43240 in  Delaware  County within  the City of Columbus and within  the Old State Road Community  Reinvestment Area (the “PROJECT SITE”).  The AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective October 23, 2015 (CRA #049-00960-06/15-001) with the abatement to commence no later than tax year 2026 nor extend beyond tax year 2035.  \n \nPursuant to Ordinance No. 1256-2016, passed May 16, 2016, the First Amendment for Assignment  and  Assumption  to  the  AGREEMENT  (the \"FIRST  AMENDMENT\")  was made and entered into effective on June 30, 2016 to amend the AGREEMENT to assign all of the benefits and obligations from N.P. Limited Pa1tnership to The Pointe at Polaris Phase I, LLC (\"Pointe I\"), and to assign certain benefits and obligations  from  Pointe  I  to  the  Columbus-Franklin  County  Finance  Authority  (\"Finance  Authority\"). Pointe I and the Finance Authority submitted an application for abatement related to the first phase of the PROJECT (\"PHASE I\") to the CITY on July 16, 2018, and the City certified to the Delaware County Auditor  (the \"AUDITOR\")  that  the  project  described  in  the  application  met  the  necessary  requirements for exemption and granted a 10-year, 100% exemption to the applicable improvements on Parcel Number 318-431-01-017-006, to commence January 1, 2018 with the term of the abatement to run through 2027.                       \n \nPursuant to Ordinance No. 1519-2019, passed June 10, 2019, the legislation authorized the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the second time  (“SECOND AMENDMENT”) to add The Pointe at Polaris Phase II, LLC as party to the AGREEMENT, to clarify the obligations and commitments of all parties to the AGREEMENT and to allow for exclusion for the CRA exemption that portion of the PROJECT SITE to be occupied by office tenants on the Phase II parcel that elect not to receive any of the benefits that may be associated with the forgone tax associated with a tax abatement related to the Phase II real property improvements.  The SECOND AMENDMENT was made and entered into effective July 10, 2019.\n \nSubsequently, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the many employees working from home, continues to impair the office real estate market as worker occupancy rates remain significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.  Additionally, pursuant to the Tax Incentive Review Council (“TIRC”) meeting on August 19, 2022, it was recommended that the CITY work with the ENTERPRISE to amend the AGREEMENT to right size the job creation based on the revised reduced amount of square footage due to the SECOND AMENDMENT and the actual jobs present in the Phase I and II upon current occupancy based on the ENTERPRISE annual report from 2021 which demonstrated 177 retained jobs and 142 new jobs. On October 10, 2022, Columbus City Council passed Resolution 0184X-2022 accepting the recommendations of the 2022 TIRC meeting. The ENTERPRISE’s largest tenant, which occupies approximately 61,000 square feet of office space at the PROJECT SITE determined it did not want to benefit from the CRA exemption; therefore, the significant amount of jobs created by the tenant are not being considered for purposes of the total number of jobs created or retained under this AGREEMENT.  The retained and new jobs include those from Dwight Capital, Cathcart, Fusion, Ohio Real Title, and Anthem. This project, now stabilized, will be adjusted based on the current occupants within the building and reviewed annually by the TIRC consistent with their recommendation. \n \nThe ENTERPRISE shall continue to share income tax revenues with the applicable school district under a section of the AGREEMENT that requires payments from the ENTERPRISE in the event income taxes do not reach agreed upon levels.  Accordingly, in the interest of providing clarity, the CITY and ENTERPRISE determine the current CARRYFORWARD AMOUNT (as defined in the AGREEMENT).   \n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the AGREEMENT for the third time to right size the job creation based on the revised reduced amount of square footage due to the SECOND AMENDMENT and the actual jobs present in the Phase I and II upon occupancy, which follows the recommendations of the TIRC, and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to stipulate to the current CARRYFORWARD AMOUNT.      \n \nThis legislation is being presented as 30-day legislation. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the City of Columbus Community Reinvestment Area Agreement for the third time to right size the job creation commitment based on the revised reduced amount of square footage of the project per the Tax Incentive Review Council (\"TIRC\")  recommendations, and to determine the current Carryforward Amount.  \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus (“CITY”) entered into a Community Reinvestment Area Agreement (the \"AGREEMENT\") with N.P.

The ENTERPRISE’s largest tenant, which occupies approximately 61,000 square feet of office space at the PROJECT SITE determined it did not want to benefit from the CRA exemption; therefore, the significant amount of jobs created by the tenant are not being considered for purposes of the total number of jobs created or retained under this AGREEMENT.  The buildings currently have 177 retained jobs and 142 new jobs from Dwight Capital, Cathcart, Fusion, Ohio Real Title, and Anthem.
