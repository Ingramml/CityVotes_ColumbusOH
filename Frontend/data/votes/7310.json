    "description": "Explanation                                                                              \n \nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nTo make sure our children are ready for kindergarten, the Department of Education uses different tools and collaborates with certain organizations in the preparation of our children. Ready4Success (R4S), administered by the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at the Ohio State University, uses a multi-pronged strategy to support providers in preparing children for Kindergarten success. The goal of the R4S initiative is to improve children’s outcomes and kindergarten readiness.  It does so by focusing on the instructional practices of pre-kindergarten teachers.\n \nFor the 2023-2024 academic year, the Crane Center staff will also develop and implement Read It Again (RIA), an evidence-based, low-cost instructional supplement designed to promote intentional teaching practices in early childhood education programs serving children from birth to age five.  Developing, implementing, and offering RIA to all early childhood providers is aligned with, and is an early strategy of, the Future Ready By Five Strategic Plan driver one:  providing development and education supports for all children.\n \nTherefore, the Department of Education requests permission to contract for $491,000.00 with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at the Ohio State University to provide this crucial work.\n \nThis contract is being awarded pursuant to Columbus City Code Section 329.30, which allows for the City to negotiate not-for-profit service contracts. The Department of Education chose the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at The Ohio State University because there is no employee expertly positioned to do this work in the city. For the past five school years, the Office of Education  has contracted and partnered with the Crane Center to expand the Early Start Columbus Program and we see that there is no other entity with the experience and expertise for the program.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract ($491,000.00) is available within the 2023 Office of Education General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract with the Crane Center for Early Childhood Research and Policy at The Ohio State University to implement Ready4Success, a screening and improvement strategy, and Read It Again, Read it Again - Math, and to provide mid-year student assessment; and to authorize the expenditure of $491,000.00 from the General Fund.
