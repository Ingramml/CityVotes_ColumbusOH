    "description": "Title\nTo Commend the Columbus Women’s Commission on their Advocacy for Black Women’s Pay Equity\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, it is estimated that on average Black women make $0.58 for every $1.00 earned by White men, with this discrepancy costing Black women upwards of $900,000 in lost earnings over the course of a 40-year career; and\nWHEREAS, Black women are faced with a unique burden: they are impacted by both a pervasive racial income gap and gender-based pay disparities; and\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 impacted many families, including financially, but Black women have shouldered a disproportionate share of the burden. In 2020, the unemployment rate for Black women peaked at 16.6%, and in August 2022, that rate decreased to 5.9%, 2.8 percentage points higher than their White male counterparts; and\n \nWHEREAS, this pay inequality has a multitude of secondary effects, including food insecurity, the perpetuation of the racial and gender wealth gap, financial precarity, and housing insecurity; and\n \nWHEREAS, recent estimates have shown that single Black women own $200 in wealth for every $28,900 single White men own, a staggering disparity that is due in part because of pay inequality; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Women’s Commission is hosting a “Black Women’s Equal Pay Signing Event” to secure commitments from business leaders and organizations across the city to work towards eliminating pay disparities among their workers; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Women’s Commission has been a tireless advocate of advancing gender and racial pay equity, launching the Columbus Commitment: Achieving Pay Equity campaign; and,\n \n \nWHEREAS under the leadership of First Lady Shannon Ginther, the Commission has played a critical role in the progress the City has had as it relates to gender equality within the areas of housing, workforce development, equity in the workplace, and health; Now, therefore, be it: and,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council commends the Columbus Women’s Commission on their advocacy for Black Women’s Pay Equity and expresses its gratitude for the Commission’s leadership on gender equality issues within the City",
