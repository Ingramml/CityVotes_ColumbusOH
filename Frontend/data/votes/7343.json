Mount at the cost of $23,950.00 to her.\n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:\nThe City will receive a total of $23,950.00 and the funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of a 0.055 acre portion of the un-named alley that is adjacent to 1954 Kenton Avenue to Molly C.
