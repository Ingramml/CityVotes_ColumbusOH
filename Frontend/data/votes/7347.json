    "description": "Background\n \nThis ordinance authorizes and directs the City Auditor to transfer and appropriate $50,000.00 from the Department of Finance and Management General Fund 1000 to the Department of Neighborhoods General Fund 1000 and authorizes the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a service agreement with Liberians in Columbus Inc., a not-for-profit agency, for the purposes of providing summer youth employment and programming, including food and transportation.\n \nThe services included in these agreements cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nExplanation\nThe Department of Neighborhoods houses youth engagement initiatives including The Commission on Black Girls (COBG) and My Brother’s Keeper (MBK).  Both programs focus on services and support for Black youth, respectively COBG focuses on Black girls and MBK centers is efforts on Boys and Young Men of Color. Additionally, this legislation is important to provide funding for summer programming and internships; because both initiatives prioritize education and employment experiences that not only support youth economically, but also provide safe environments that may deter youth from engaging in behaviors that could negatively impact their futures.  \nAbout COBG & MBK\nOn July 16, 2018, Columbus City Council adopted resolution number 0208X-2018 to create The Commission on Black Girls (The Commission or COBG). The creation of COBG was led by former Councilmember Priscilla R. Tyson. The impetus for creating The Commission was the disparities that Black women experience in several areas including but not limited to: homelessness, eviction, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and the wage gap. To change this trajectory, the intent was to start at earlier stages of development and focus on girls.  Charged with studying the quality of life of Black girls in Columbus, The Commission released a report in July 2020 with 18 recommendation areas that are intended to improve services and systemic issues that impact Black girls. The three main areas of focus in the report include Education, Economics, and Mental & Emotional Health. \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that students can benefit from summer employment and programming opportunities for the remainder of the summer recess.\nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the transfer, appropriation and expenditure of $50,000.00 from the General Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is:\n \nLiberians in Columbus Inc 033248 and is valid 7/7/2023 - 7/7/2025\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with the following not-for-profit agencies in support of summer youth employment and programs: Liberians in Columbus Inc.; to authorize the transfer, appropriation and expenditure of $50,000.00 within the general fund; to authorize the payment of expenses starting May 22, 2023; and to declare an emergency.
