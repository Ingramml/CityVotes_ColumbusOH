    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThe Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging of the Recreation and Parks Department was awarded federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds from the Ohio Department of Aging for the continuation of services to older adults in the Central Ohio area, including Delaware, Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Licking, Madison, Pickaway and Union Counties.\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a non-profit service contract with The Gladden Community House for the provision of supportive and home modification services for the period July 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024.\nApproximately 100 individuals are expected to be served.\nBID INFORMATION:\nThe Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging selected service providers in accordance with the procedures set forth in Columbus City Code, Section 329. COAAA released a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for senior community services on April 10, 2023 and hosted a virtual bidder’s conference on April 14, 2023. Interested service providers submitted proposals on May 5, 2023. Proposals were competitively reviewed by COAAA employees from May 5 to May 26, 2023. Based on the evaluation of the 121 service applications received, a determination was made by COAAA’s Administrator to enter into contract with The Gladden Community House and 32 other agencies, whose contracts were authorized by Ordinance 1710-2023 on July 10, 2023. COAAA’s Advisory Council approved the recommendations to fund the identified service providers.\nThis contract is awarded pursuant to City Code Sections 329 relating to non-profit service contracts, such that the services provided by The Gladden Community House cannot be provided by existing city employees. COAAA employees do not have the expertise to perform supportive and home modification services. \nEmergency Justification:\nEmergency action is requested in order to have the contract in place by July 1, 2023, or as soon as possible, as stipulated in the grant requirements, so there is no delay in services to older adults.\nFiscal Impact: $60,000.00 is required and budgeted from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund to meet the financial obligation of this contract.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a non-profit service contract with The Gladden Community House to provide supportive and home modification services to older adults in Central Ohio for the period of July 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024; to authorize the expenditure of $60,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($60,000.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, American Rescue Plan Act funding to enter into a non-profit contract with The Gladden Community House to provide supportive and home modification services to older adults in Central Ohio for the period of July 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024, was made available to the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging from the Ohio Department of Aging; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into a non-profit contract with The Gladden Community House to provide supportive and home modification services to older adults in Central Ohio for the period of July 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024; and\nWHEREAS, expenditure of American Rescue Plan Act funding is necessary to help expand such services for older Americans that are needed as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency; and\nWHEREAS, such expenditure of funds has not been previously accounted for in the 2023 Budget; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into said contract to avoid delay of services to older adults, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE, \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Director of Recreation and Parks is authorized and directed to enter into a non-profit contract with The Gladden Community House to provide supportive and home modification services to older adults in Central Ohio for the period of July 1, 2023, to September 30, 2024.\nSECTION 2. That this contract is awarded pursuant to City Code Sections 329 relating to non-profit service contracts. Pursuant to City Code Section 329, the services provided by the contracting agencies cannot be provided by existing city employees, as COAAA employees do not have the expertise to perform supportive and home modification services. \nSECTION 3. That to pay the cost of said contract, the expenditure of $60,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized from and within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund No. 2286, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 4. At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized, and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or 10 days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
