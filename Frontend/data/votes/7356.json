    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department modify an existing contract with Pavement Protectors, Inc. DBA M&D Blacktop for the Hard Surface Improvements 2021-2022 Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $135,000.00. The original contract was authorized by Ordinance 2031-2022. \n \nEach year, the Recreation and Parks Department allocates a portion of the Capital Improvement Budget for the improvement of existing hard surfaces and new installations of hard surfaces. This particular contract focuses on the improvement of asphalt and concrete surfaces that are highly used by the public and includes entry drives, parking lots, trails, sidewalks, and sport courts. By improving these surfaces, safe and easy access can be ensured to the parks and facilities. Areas for improvement were initially considered through recommendations from internal staff and public involvement. All requests were assessed through a Pavement Condition Rating (PCR) form and were given a rating from 0, meaning the worst condition, to 100, meaning the best condition. All requests were prioritized for action based on their respective PCR scores. From there, staff confirmed which projects to move forward with.\n \nThe additional scope of work outlined below was not included in the original contract because they were not known or prioritized at that time. Since the contract was awarded, the additional scope of work was elevated in importance and urgency due to 311 requests and safety concerns. The current contract will perform the work as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Work was negotiated using established unit prices.  It is not advantageous to pursue another procurement process due to the emergency need for this work to be completed and the prices came from the established low bidder.\n \nThe additional scope of work is as follows:\n \nDriving Park - tennis courts improvements \nThompson Park - basketball courts Improvements \nDeshler Park - concrete drive apron improvements Tuttle Park - Restripe speed hump \nMarie Mooreland Playground - pave ADA compliant hard surface connector \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nPavement Protectors, Inc. DBA M&D Blacktop\n2020 Longwood Avenue \nGrove City, Ohio, 43123 \nMark Nance, (614) 875-9989\nContract Compliance Number: 004731\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 26, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested due to public safety concerns at these locations as cracked pavement on sport courts can lead to injury and this existing contract needs to be modified in order to avoid a delay in completion of the work as there is a limited window for weather appropriate construction of hard surface improvements prior to the end of 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project aims to provide accessible and usable asphalt, concrete, and sport court improvements throughout our park properties.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Needed improvements were identified by both internal staff and from community requests. The community has expressed the desire for well-kept facilities and amenities through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with staff.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by removing access and circulation barriers to city parks. It also helps meet the goal of improving at least five neighborhood parks per year. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $1,127,000.00 was legislated for the Hard Surface Improvements 2021-2022 Project by Ordinance 2031-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $135,000.00. $135,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,262,000.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Pavement Protectors, Inc.
