    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background:\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Dave Perry, requester and agent for Sliver, LTD asking the City sell an approximate 3,315 square foot portion of right-of-way a.k.a. E. 10th Ave Alley.  The right-of-way area is an unnamed alley adjacent to, and running parallel with, E 10th Ave.  The area starts out running south off of E 10th Ave and is north/south directionally for approximately 25+/- feet and then makes a 90 degree turn to the east and runs east/west directionally for 255 +/- feet.  It is the first alley south of E 10th Ave.  This portion of right-of-way is adjacent to four parcels that are between the requested area and E 10th Ave to the north:  PID = 010-269255, 010-297804, 010-297803, 010-297802; and parcels adjacent to the requested area to the south:  PID = 010-269254, 010-012937, 010-001082, 010-046095, 010-028751, 010-018713, 010-025569, and 010-018238, totaling approximately 3,315 square feet or 0.076 acres. \n \nSale of this right-of-way will facilitate the combining of parcels and allow redevelopment of the site with an apartment building.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to sell the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $66,300.00 was established.  Dave Perry requested mitigation.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on February 18, 2021.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to deny mitigation and recommended the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Sliver, LTD at the cost of $66,300.00 to them.\n \n2. FISCAL IMPACT:\nThe City will receive a total of $66,300.00 and the funds are to be deposited in Fund 7748, Project P537650, as consideration for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary to transfer a 3,315 square feet (0.076 acres) portion of the right-of-way, as described in the attachment hereto, to Sliver, LTD. \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Dave Perry, requester and agent for Sliver, Ltd, asking that the City sell an approximate 3,315 square foot portion of right-of-way a.k.a.
