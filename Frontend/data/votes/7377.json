    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Kaleidoscope Youth Center, a non profit entity, for the support of their Wellness Initiative and Emergency Housing programs.\n \nKaleidoscope Youth Center (KYC) is the largest and longest standing organization serving LGBTQIA+ youth in the state of Ohio. Since 1994, KYC has been the leader and expert in meeting the needs of and supporting LGBTQIA+ young people in the central Ohio community. \n \nThe KYC Community Wellness Initiative is an expansion of KYC’s current programming with an intersectional focus on the emerging mental health and wellness needs of LGBTQIA+ youth and young adults. This initiative works to implement sustainable community based wellness programs that improve the lives of adolescents; identify health conditions and environmental factors that are associated with barriers to wellness, and aid in improving the social determinants of health and wellness as it relates to LGBTQIA+ youth and young adults. Clinical approaches will include trauma informed, wrap-around services to support young people in meeting their basic needs and building a strong sense of self and self-esteem through affirmation and empowerment, and holistic health and wellness activities.\n \nThe KYC Emergency Housing Program serves and supports homeless and housing insecure/vulnerable young adults ages 18-24 through the lenses of intersectionality and trauma informed/healing engaged care. The vision is to keep our young people off of the streets, and to decrease and disrupt the potential and/or subsequent crises that often arise when youth are without a predictable and consistent safe place to stay. Through no less than a 30 day supported stay at a local extended stay facility or hotel, youth will have the opportunity to experience a safer and supportive housing environment. Programming is low barrier to prioritize prevention through early engagement and linkage to resources and community support. Each young person utilizing services will be provided a case manager to assist them in developing and implementing a case plan, with the ultimate goal being to move participants from supportive housing into a safe, stable, and sustainable independent housing experience.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure funding is available immediately to provide assistance to the mental health and housing needs of LGBTQIA+ youth and young adults.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Kaleidoscope Youth Center in support of their Wellness Initiative and Emergency Housing programs; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
