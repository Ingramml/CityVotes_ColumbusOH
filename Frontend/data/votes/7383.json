    "description": "Explanation\nThe Civil Service Commission is requesting approval to modify the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., increasing the maximum authorized expenditure for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police and Fire Academy classes. \n \nThe Civil Service Commission is requesting approval to modify the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., increasing the maximum authorized expenditure in order to avail funds for upcoming medical screening services. Funding is typically added two to three times each budget year prior to the start of academy class, rather all at one time at the beginning of the year, so as to not tie-up City funds prematurely or unnecessarily.  For this second requested modification, we are requesting an increase of $70,000.00 to the current $240,000.00, previously authorized, for a new total 2023 appropriation of $310,000.00.\n \nBid Information: In 2022, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ 023538) for these services and accepted proposals through December 2, 2022. Three proposals were submitted by the deadline.  An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFQ and the Executive Director selected and executed a contract with the selected vendor, Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., via Ordinance 3084-2022 followed by a first modification via Ordinance 0776-2023.  Because the resulting contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. is valid through 2025, if renewed by the City, re-bidding for these services at this time is not required or needed.  Pricing for these services were determined via the RFQ process and were subsequently memorialized in the contract with the vendor. \n \nContract Compliance Number: CC005227, expires 10/4/2023. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this wave of services is budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2023 General Fund budget. \n                     \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; to authorize the additional expenditure of $70,000.00 from the General Fund ($70,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the contract to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. based upon the submissions of RFQ 023538; and\n \nWHEREAS, Two Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($240,000.00) have been previously authorized to Mount Carmel Health Providers for the pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits services per Ordinances 3084-2022 and 0776-2023; and\n \nWHEREAS it is now necessary to modify and increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes; and; now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to modify and increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the purpose of administering pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress tests to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2. That the additional expenditure of $70,000.00 (for a new total authorization of $310,000.00 to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc.), or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor be and is hereby authorized to establish an Auditor's Certificate on behalf of the Civil Service Commission for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these expenditures are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City’s financial records.\n \nSECTION 6. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
