    "description": "Background: This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to enter into contract with Johnson Mirmiran & Thompson, Inc. dba JMT Technology Group for Professional IT Consulting and Programming Services for financial systems archival project. The contract amount is $390,000, with a contingency of $80,000 for a total amount of $470,000. A sizable contingency is required as there will be some complexity in moving images and additional requirements discovery in building a compatible user interface prior to decommissioning the old systems of record.  \n \nIn January 2016, the City Auditor’s office implemented Dynamics AX to replace Performance Series FMS. As part of the conversion, only 2015 balances, active vendors and current obligations were imported into Dynamics AX. Historical financial transactions from 1998 through 2015 were retained in an Oracle database. Since 2016, City users have been accessing historical information through the Performance desktop client using this database to do historical research on encumbrances, grants, projects, and assorted other items. There is additional data and documentation stored in various periphery databases for other archived information such as FAMIS payment history from 1979-1998 and voucher images from 2007-2015.  Records retention requirements are quite long for grants and capital projects. Grants vary by grantor, but for debt-financed projects, the City needs to keep records from the bond’s date of issuance through 3 years after maturity. For example, if priced twenty-year bonds in 2010, and the final maturity was 2030, then City Auditor would not be able to dispose of records until 2033.\nAs part of a Department of Technology initiative to consolidate databases and reduce overall City licensing costs, this database is moving to a shared SQL Server database, which will not work with the existing user interface.  Additionally, the Performance client is well past end of life and unsupported; we are also in danger of it no longer working with Windows as it releases new service packs and versions and the number of people that know how to access and use this application is dwindling. Moreover, the City has a searchable image archive of invoices from 2007-2015 that needs updating to get on a more current version of SQL Server. This project is to design and build a new web-based system for financial database archives to look up historical data through a consolidated application. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nRequest for Proposals (RFP) were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on April 26, 2023.
