    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $1,797,205.00 in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG-CV) Fund 2248 to be applied towards the costs of the Glenwood and Windsor Pool Replacements Project via an expenditure correction.  \n \nOrdinance 1610-2022 authorized the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with 2K General Company, in the amount of $18,028,000.00 for the construction of the Glenwood and Windsor Pool Replacements Project. The project is well underway and is expected to be substantially complete in the summer of 2023. $3,000,000.00 of this total contract was funded by the CDBG Fund 2248 in the original Ordinance 1610-2022, with the remaining $15,028,000.00 being funded by the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. This ordinance will authorize the Recreation and Parks Department to submit an expenditure correction to move $1,797,205.00 more of this project to the CDBG Fund 2248. The funding is being provided by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG-CV) Program, in conjunction with the CARES Act, and in accordance with the 2020 Amended Annual Action Plan. The funding split, as a result of this expenditure correction, will be $4,797,205.00 from the CDBG-CV Fund 2248 and $13,230,795.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested as this project is nearing completion, the funding sources need to be corrected, and to meet the timeliness goals associated with the CDBG funding. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by improving two important recreational facilities that have served their respective communities for over 50 years. Improvements to our parks and facilities provide significant benefits to the quality of life in the neighborhoods in which they are located.\n \nCommunity Input Issues: The community has expressed the desire for well-kept and updated facilities through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff. As part of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Aquatic Capital Improvement Plan, residents in the service areas of these swimming pools were engaged through their Associations and Commissions.\n \nArea(s) Affected: East Columbus (50), Greater Hilltop (53)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by improving existing aquatics facilities and helping to ensure that facilities remain safe and user friendly.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,797,205.00 is budgeted and available from within the CDBG-CV Fund 2248 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $1,797,205.00 within the CDBG Fund in accordance with the 2020 Amended Annual Action Plan; to authorize an expenditure correction of $1,797,205.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund to the CDBG Fund for the Glenwood and Windsor Pool Replacements Project; and to declare an emergency.
