    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service agreement with the Legal Aid Society of Columbus in an amount up to $1,500,000.00 in support of the Tenant Advocacy Project (TAP) to provide legal representation to residents facing an eviction.  \n \nTenants with legal representation are much more likely to avoid an eviction judgment and keep possession of their homes than unrepresented tenants. In addition to these primary effects, a right to counsel offers several secondary benefits to defendants who are sued for eviction. Attorneys may be able to keep eviction filings off tenants’ records, arrange for alternative housing, negotiate reasonable amounts of time for tenants to move out, reduce or eliminate money owed to the landlord, or help tenants apply for rental assistance.\n \nWith these dollars, The Legal Aid Society of Columbus will be able to staff additional TAP attorneys and support staff for an additional year. Because the Tenant Advocacy Project attorneys specialize in these services this cannot be provided by existing city employees.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to ensure that The Legal Aid Society of Columbus can immediately continue providing additional legal counsel at eviction court on behalf of Columbus residents facing eviction.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds are available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund to support this contract.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor’s vendor number is 006124 and is compliant through 3/28/24.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service agreement with the Legal Aid Society of Columbus in an amount up to $1,500,000.00 in support of the Tenant Advocacy Project (TAP) to provide legal representation to residents facing an eviction; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Public Safety Initiative subfund; and to declare an emergency.
