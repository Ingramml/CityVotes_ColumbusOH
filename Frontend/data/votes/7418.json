    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  To authorize and direct the Director of Public Safety to enter into contract with Motorola Solutions, DBA Vigilant Solutions, to purchase license subscriptions for the Investigative Data Platform. The commercial License Plate Reader (LPR) licensing subscriptions will enable the LPRs and the Neighborhood Safety Camera systems to continue to work in conjunction with the Shot Spotter program and will help provide vital information from vehicles leaving the areas when the Division of Police is alerted by the Shot Spotter program.  \n \nBid Information: This purchase is manifestly impractical to bid because we currently use this software and other law enforcement agencies use similar Motorola licenses, which will allow Columbus Police to share important information with other local agencies as crime often crosses jurisdictional borders.  Therefore, the Division of Police is requesting a Bid Waiver in accordance with Chapter 329 of the City Code. \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nContract Compliance: CC-007169                      Expires 10/18/2024\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is necessary to make the funds available as soon as possible to prevent a break in service and to continue vital police investigations. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the Safety Director to enter into contract with Motorola Solutions, DBA Vigilant Solutions, to purchase commercial license subscriptions for the Investigative Data Platform.
