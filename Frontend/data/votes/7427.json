    "title": "To repeal and amend various sections in Title 33 of the Columbus City Codes, entitled “Zoning Code,” in order to update and modernize terms, correct typographic mistakes, to clarify that automobile maintenance and repair is an allowable use in the M-1 and M-2 Manufacturing zoning districts, and to allow one- and two-units dwellings in apartment residential zoning districts.",
    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND:\nIn an effort to modernize code language, correct typographical errors, and to address specific land use regulations in order to more efficiently regulate changing land use patterns and development trends, it is necessary to update various code sections in Title 33, the Columbus Zoning Code.\n \nThis ordinance, in addition to correcting typographic errors and updating terms and nomenclature, will also make some minor regulatory changes. The proposed code changes will allow single- and two-unit dwellings in apartment residential zoning districts where apartment complexes are already allowed, as well as adjusting the frontage requirements, and eliminating the need for variances when multi-unit residential developments cross parcel lines with differing taxing districts that cannot be combined. These code changes will also permit automobile maintenance and repair uses in the M-1 and M-2 Manufacturing districts, where heavy truck/bus service garage and repair of fleet vehicles are already allowed. Additionally, the proposed changes will permit wall graphics on the primary frontage of a building even if the commonly used public entrance may be located elsewhere on the building.  This ordinance also reorganizes other code provisions to achieve more efficient administration of the Zoning Code without substantively changing said regulations.    \n \nA public hearing was held before the Columbus Development Commission on June 8, 2023, and the Columbus Graphics Commission at their June 20, 2023 meeting.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo repeal and amend various sections in Title 33 of the Columbus City Codes, entitled “Zoning Code,” in order to update and modernize terms, correct typographic mistakes, to clarify that automobile maintenance and repair is an allowable use in the M-1 and M-2 Manufacturing zoning districts, and to allow one- and two-units dwellings in apartment residential zoning districts.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in an effort to modernize code language, correct typographical errors, and to address specific land use regulations in order to more efficiently regulate changing land use patterns and development trends, it is necessary to update various code sections in Title 33, the Columbus Zoning Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance, in addition to correcting typographic errors and updating terms and nomenclature, will also make some needed minor regulatory changes; and\n \nWHEREAS, the proposed code changes will allow single- and two-unit dwellings in apartment residential zoning districts where apartment complexes are already allowed, as well as adjusting the frontage requirements, and eliminating the need for variances when multi-unit residential developments cross parcel lines with differing taxing districts that cannot be combined; and\n \nWHEREAS, these code changes will also allow automobile service and repairs in the M-1 and M-2 Manufacturing zoning districts, where heavy truck/bus service garage and repair of fleet vehicles are already permitted; and\n \nWHEREAS, additionally, the proposed changes will permit wall graphics on the primary frontage of a building even if the commonly used public entrance may be located elsewhere on the building; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance also reorganizes other code provisions to achieve more efficient administration of the Zoning Code without substantively changing said regulations; and\n \nWHEREAS, public hearings were held before the Columbus Development Commission on June 8, 2023, and the Graphics Commission on June 20, 2023, and these proposed code changes are fully supported by these commissions for adoption by Columbus City Council; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
