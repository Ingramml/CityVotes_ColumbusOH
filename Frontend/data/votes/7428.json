    "title": "To repeal and replace various sections in Chapter 3312, “Off-Street Parking and Loading” of the Columbus City Codes in order to update and modernize the minimum number of off-street parking and loading spaces required by code, and to update overall off-street parking and loading space regulations.",
    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND:\nChapter 3312 of the Columbus Zoning Code, Title 33, regulates Off-Street Parking and Loading. These regulations were last reviewed and overhauled in 2010 with the passage of Ordinance No. 1536-2009.\n \nThe code changes contained in this ordinance will update and continue to modernize the Columbus Zoning Code regulations regarding off-street parking and loading by adding code language to better contend with existing situations and situations where parcels cannot be combined due to differing taxing districts. These code changes also add language related to prohibited parking, and clarifies the requirements for stacking spaces, pedestrian circulation routes, parking in a driveway, landscaping, and screening. Additionally, these code changes address parking for office uses in the Short North Special Parking Area.  \n \nFurther, minor adjustments are made to the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for specified uses while the list of specified uses is added for clarity. Finally, these code changes streamline the requirements for bicycle parking by removing the design standards that are already regulated by the Department of Public Service. Overall, these code changes will make regulating, applying, and enforcing the provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 3312, “Off-Street Parking and Loading” easier and more efficient, while also ensuring a consistent approach for all users of the zoning code. \n \nA public hearing was held before the Columbus Development Commission on June 8, 2023, and presentations to the Victorian Village Commission and the Italian Village Commission are being made at each of their respective business meetings in late June.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\n \nTo repeal and replace various sections in Chapter 3312, “Off-Street Parking and Loading” of the Columbus City Codes in order to update and modernize the minimum number of off-street parking and loading spaces required by code, and to update overall off-street parking and loading space regulations.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the code changes contained in this ordinance will update and continue to modernize the Columbus Zoning Code regulations regarding off-street parking and loading by adding code language to better contend with existing situations and situations where parcels cannot be combined due to being located in differing tax districts; and\n \nWHEREAS, the code changes also add language related to prohibited parking and clarifies the requirements for stacking spaces, pedestrian circulation routes, parking in a driveway, landscaping, and screening requirements; and\n \nWHEREAS, additionally, the code changes also address parking for office uses in the Short North Special Parking Area; and\n \nWHEREAS, further, minor adjustments are made to the minimum number of required off-street parking spaces for specified uses while the list of specified uses is amended  for clarity; and\n \nWHEREAS, these code changes also streamline the requirements for bicycle parking by removing the design standards that are already regulated by the Department of Public Service; and\n \nWHEREAS, overall, these code changes will make regulating, applying, and enforcing the provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 3312, “Off-Street Parking and Loading” easier and more efficient, while also ensuring a consistent approach for all users of the zoning code; and\n \nWHEREAS, a public hearing was held before the Columbus Development Commission on June 8, 2023, and presentations are being made to the Victorian Village and Italian Village commissions in June, and these proposed code changes are fully supported by these commissions for adoption by Columbus City Council; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
