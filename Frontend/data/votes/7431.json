    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to amend various sections of the City’s Licensing code pertaining to vehicles for hire and the operations of the Vehicle For Hire and Mobile Food Vending advisory boards.    Several updates have been made to this code over the past decade, including revisions to include new modes of transportation such as micro-transit vehicles and pedal wagons.  Currently, the City is proposing new minor changes to further update the code.  \n \nThis ordinance will make the following changes:      \n•                     If a licensee is late renewing a license, the Code would now allow the Licensing Section the flexibility to consider extreme hardship as a reason to allow for the renewal, rather than having the licensee register for a new license.  \n•                     Alter the requirements for quorum for the Vehicle For Hire and Mobile Food Vending boards by allowing quorum to be half plus one of the current membership of the board, rather than a specific number representing full membership.  This would make quorum more frequent, as there are times when not all board seats are filled.   \n•                     Change the frequency of Vehicle for Hire Board meetings to quarterly, rather than monthly.  Additional meetings are still allowed to be called in situations where the board chair or members call for such.\n \nOverall, these changes will further the City administration’s and Council’s efforts to update and streamline the Licensing Code and modernize regulations for the City’s businesses and residents.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend various sections in Chapters 501, 573, and 585 of the Columbus City Codes to allow flexibility in license renewal and alter frequency of regular meetings and quorum for the Vehicle for Hire Board and Mobile Food Vending Advisory Board.    \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Title 5 of the Columbus City Codes pertains to business regulation and licensing, and Chapters 501, 573, and 585 pertain to the licensing generally and regulation of vehicles for hire and mobile food vending; and \n \nWHEREAS, several updates have been made to this code over the past decade, including revisions to include new modes of transportation such as micro-transit vehicles and pedal wagons; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City is now proposing minor changes to the code, including additional flexibility to consider license renewals and the quorum and frequency of meetings for the Vehicle for Hire Board and the Mobile Food Vending Advisory Board; and \n \nWHEREAS, these changes will further the City administration’s and Council’s efforts to update and streamline the Licensing Code and modernize regulations for the City’s businesses and residents; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That sections 501.17, 573.168, 585.09, and 585.14 of the Columbus City Codes are hereby amended as follows:\n \nCHAPTER 501 - LICENSING AND REGULATION GENERALLY\n \n501.17 - Renewal of licenses.\n \n(A)  All applications for the renewal of licenses shall be submitted to the section no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the license and shall be upon forms approved by the license manager.

The chair shall be counted as a vote if necessary to complete the requirements for a quorum, but otherwise will vote only in the event of a tie vote.\n \n \nCHAPTER 585 - VEHICLE FOR HIRE BOARD\n \n585.09 - Voting; quorum.\n \nAll members of the Board will be voting members.
