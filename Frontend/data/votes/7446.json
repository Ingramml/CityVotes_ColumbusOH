    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nOn July 14, 2021, Pulte Homes of Ohio LLC and Harmony Development Group, LLC submitted to the City a petition to organize a new community authority under Revised Code Chapter 349 to be known as the Sugar Farm-Renner South New Community Authority (the “Authority”). City Council adopted Resolution No. 0118X-2021 to determine that the petition was sufficient and to schedule a public hearing that was held August 23, 2021. By Resolution No. 0243X-2021 adopted by City Council, the petition was approved, the Authority was established, and City Council appointed the original three citizen members and one local government representative to the Authority’s board of trustees. This resolution is to appoint new members and to reappoint existing members to the Authority’s board of trustees following the expiration of the terms of the members appointed by Resolution No. 0243X-2021 and the resignation of a certain member.\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the immediate (re)appointment of citizen members to the board of trustees of the Sugar Farm-Renner South New Community Authority in order for them to have a quorum to conduct business, as required by Section 349.04 of the Ohio Revised Code. The board needs to meet within thirty days of the effective date of this resolution to preserve enough time for the board to certify charges to the county for assessment, which will allow the board and the City to start receiving revenues next year to pay current costs and interest.\nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo appoint and reappoint members to the board of trustees of the Sugar Farm-Renner South New Community Authority as provided by Chapter 349 of the Ohio Revised Code; and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, a petition for the organization of a new community authority under R.C. Chapter 349 (the “Petition”) known as the Sugar Farm-Renner South New Community Authority (the “Authority”) was submitted on July 14, 2021 to this Council by Pulte Homes of Ohio, LLC and Harmony Development Group, LLC; and \nWHEREAS, on July 22, 2021, this Council adopted its Resolution No. 0118X-2021, in which this Council determined that the Petition was sufficient and complied with the requirements of R.C. Section 349.03 in form and substance; and\nWHEREAS, a public hearing on the Petition was held on August 23, 2021; and\nWHEREAS, by Resolution No. 0243X-2021 adopted December 13, 2021, this Council approved the petition and established the Authority after determining that the Authority will be conducive to the public health, safety convenience, and welfare; and \nWHEREAS, this Council further adopted under Resolution No. 0243X-2021 that the board of trustees of the Authority shall be composed of seven (7) members, and appointed three members as citizen members  and one member to serve as a representative of local government; and\nWHEREAS, since the original appointments were made by this Council, one of the citizen members resigned, the terms of the other two citizen members have expired, and the term of the local government representative is about to expire; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is necessary to immediately appoint and reappoint members to the board of trustees of the Authority, so they can meet within thirty days of the effective date of this resolution to be able to timely certify charges to the county, which will allow for the collection of those charges next year to minimize costs and interest owed by the City thereby preserving, enhancing, and protecting the public health, peace, property, and safety; and NOW THEREFORE,\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  The appointees of the City to the board of trustees of the Authority shall be as follows: \n(i)                     Ashley Hoye is hereby appointed, as a citizen member for a two-year term, such term beginning on the effective date of this resolution, and shall continue to hold over into one or more subsequent terms until a new citizen member is duly appointed to serve for the remainder of such term.\n \n(ii)                     Derek Farwick is hereby appointed as a citizen member for the balance of a two-year term, such term beginning on the effective date of this resolution, and shall continue to hold over into one or more subsequent terms until a new citizen member is duly appointed to service for the remainder of such term.\n \n(iii)                     Beth Poling is hereby reappointed, as a citizen member for a two-year term, such term beginning on the effective date of this resolution, and shall continue to hold over into one or more subsequent terms until a new citizen member is duly appointed to service for the remainder of such term.\n \n(iv)                     Michelle Larsen, is hereby reappointed as a representative of local government for a two-year term, such term beginning on December 6, 2023, and shall continue to hold over into one or more subsequent terms until a new representative of local government is duly appointed to serve for the remainder of such term.\nSECTION 2. For the reasons stated in the Preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Resolution is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its adoption and approval by the Mayor or ten days after the passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
