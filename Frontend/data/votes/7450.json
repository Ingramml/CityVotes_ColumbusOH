    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance amends the acceptance of certain territory (AN23-002) by the city of Columbus, originally approved on June 26, 2023. The Department of Development has determined that it is necessary to amend the acceptance due to an unintentional typographical error on the amount of acreage accepted. The original ordinance authorized the transfer of territory to Montgomery Township per an annexation agreement between the City and Blendon Township, and the requirement to submit a petition to the Board of County Commissioners of Franklin County, Ohio in accordance with Section 503.07 of the Ohio Revised Code requires this legislation be filed as emergency. \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nProvision of municipal services does represent cost to the City; however, the annexation of land also has the potential to create revenue to the City.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the acceptance for the annexation of certain territory containing 0.464± acres in Blendon Township (AN23-002) approved on June 26, 2023 to correct a typographical error and to declare an emergency.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, on June 26, 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1674-2023 accepting the annexation; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the acceptance of the annexation to correct a typographical error on the amount of acreage to be accepted; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to amend the acceptance of certain territory (AN23-002) by the city of Columbus, originally approved on June 26, 2023 to correct an unintentional typographical error on the amount of acreage accepted in order to timely submit a petition to the Franklin County Board of Commissioners within the time frame required in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code all for the preservation of the public peace, property, health safety and welfare; now, therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS\nSECTION 1. That the title of Ordinance 1674-2023 is hereby amended to read as follows:\nTo accept the application (AN23-002) of the Wayne Post Trust for the annexation of certain territory containing 0.464± 4.64± acres in Blendon Township.”  \nSECTION 2. All other provisions of Ordinance Number 1674-2023 remain effective as adopted prior to this ordinance.\nSECTION 3.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
