    "description": "1. Background:\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Columbus Regional Airport Authority (CRAA) asking that the City extinguish the right-of-way and transfer the asset of a 7.195 +/- acre portion of right-of-way from the Department of Public Service to the Columbus Regional Airport Authority to be combined with Parcel 010-1044433.  Right-of-way area is north of Aircenter Drive and east of Stelzer Road. Abutted to the north by parcels 010-104436 and 010-104443 and to the south by parcels 010-146781, 010-146764, and 010-104443. The right-of-way is located entirely within the bounds of existing airport property.\n \nIt is necessary to extinguish the right-of-way and transfer the asset to CRAA.  This right-of-way is within CRAA's parcel (PID 010-104443, 010-104436, 010-146781, 010-146764, and 010-104443) boundaries and should not exist as City right-of-way but should be under the control of CRAA.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by extinguishing this right-of-way and transferring the asset to CRAA.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the asset as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way. \n \nThis request went before the Director of Public Service in April of 2023.  After review of the request, the Director supports the above referenced right-of-way be extinguished and transferred to CRAA at no cost to them.\n \n2.
