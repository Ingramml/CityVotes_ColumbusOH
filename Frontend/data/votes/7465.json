    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther's vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten education for every 4-year-old. Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nChildren who participate in high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills. Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate. \n \nThe purpose of Early Start Columbus is to expand high-quality pre-kindergarten services through partnerships with Columbus City Schools and community-based providers. The providers partnering in the Early Start Columbus Program have all demonstrated their ability to provide a high-quality pre-kindergarten education. All partnering providers are rated at least three stars in the State’s Step Up To Quality rating and improvement system.  \n \nState law makes allowable the braiding of Ohio Department of Education Early Childhood Expansion funds with those of the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Service Publicly Funded Childcare program. The 2023-2024 Early Start Columbus Program combines the Mayor’s Office of Education funds with these funding streams to further extend the number of children served while using City funds more efficiently. This approach uses City funds as “last dollar” funding.  \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance will use the funding from Ordinance 1931-2023. ACPO009370.\nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency designation is requested to ensure the contracts are enacted to meet the operational needs of the providers.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to enter into contracts with Child Development Council of Franklin County, Inc. and Christ the King Church dba All Saints Academy which were selected via a competitive application process for educational services; to authorize the expenditure from ACPO009370 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education desires to enter into contracts with two additional high-quality pre-kindergarten organizations to provide educational services and quality pre-kindergarten services to Columbus 4-year-olds to prepare them for kindergarten; and \n \nWHEREAS, research shows that quality pre-kindergarten instruction provides meaningful value to children’s educational performance and preparation for school; and\n \nWHEREAS, the goal is that all children in the City of Columbus will be kindergarten ready; and \n \nWHEREAS, Christ the King Church dba All Saints Academy and Child Development Council of Franklin County were chosen via a competitive application process; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Mayor’s Office of Education in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contracts to meet the operational needs of the Early Start Columbus providers, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; Now, Therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education be and is hereby authorized to enter into contracts with the following quality pre-kindergarten organizations, under the terms and conditions and in the amounts deemed necessary to advance the Early Start Columbus initiative.

These providers were selected due to their prior experience and success in providing the same services in the 2022-2023 school year and via a competitive application process:\n \nChrist the King Church dba All Saints Academy\nChild Development Council of Franklin County, Inc. \n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure shall be from ACPO009370 which was established with Ordinance 1931-2023 which passed City Council on July 31, 2023.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or 10 days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
