    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $42,085.96 of the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA)-CV grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development (DOD) to execute a Subrecipient Agreement - Not-for-Profit Service Contract with Faith Mission, Inc., in an amount up to $42,085.96, to provide rental assistance and supportive services to low income individuals and/or households living with HIV/AIDS.\n \nHistorically, the HOPWA grant (including HOPWA-CV) has been managed and administrated by Columbus Public Health (CPH).  Starting with the 2022 grant year funds, the annual HOPWA grant has been managed and administered by the Department of Development (DOD), Division of Housing.  As a result of this ordinance, DOD will also manage and administer the remaining COVID-CV funds so they are expended before the federal deadline.  \n \nUpon review of HOPWA-CV program needs in DOD, it was determined that there was no longer an extensive need for short-term rent, mortgage, and utility assistance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but additional rental assistance and supportive services would benefit this community in response to the pandemic.
