This legislation represents an additional amount up to $250,000.00, for a total amount up to $1,500,000.00.  The commitment letter and loan agreement have not yet been executed, therefore funding from Ordinance 0951-2023 and this ordinance will fund the to-be-executed documents.\n \nPoplar Fen Place will be placed on a 6.4-acre site on Chatterton Road in southeast Columbus. The proposed three-story, elevator-served building is “L” shaped with an entrance off Chatterton Road and green space in the rear. Poplar Fen Place will share a driveway with Marsh Brook Place, a 40-unit PSH development for Transition Aged Youth, but the buildings will not be connected.  Poplar Fen Place will provide forty-four (44) one-bedroom units of permanent supportive housing prioritized for individuals over the age of 55 who meet the State of Ohio’s Permanent Supportive Housing Policy Framework.  Of the forty-four units, thirty-five (35) will prioritize individuals who meet the HUD definition of homelessness and the remaining nine (9) units will be targeted for use by individuals who have a severe mental health diagnosis.   \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2023 Action Plan, per Ordinance 3353-2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow the Director of Development to immediately execute a commitment letter and loan agreement with the developer in preparation for the project’s schedule closing on September 15, 2023.  A delay in execution of the city’s financial support documents may result in increased project costs.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 044448 and expires 2/22/2025.\n \nFiscal Impact: $250,000.00 is available from the 2023 HOME grant (G442202).  The commitment of funds through this legislation is conditioned on compliance with HUD’s environmental review requirements.
