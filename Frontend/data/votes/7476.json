S. Treasury) to qualify residents of the local community for funding in order to ensure housing stability. All provisions of PO386264 will be in effect, as this modification is simply to increase funding as the demand for assistance is so great.  \n \nOriginal                     $ 47,874.00 Ord. 1019-2023 PO386264\nModification                     $200,000.00                     \nTotal amount                     $247,874.00                     \n \nUnder this contract, the full amount of funding will be used to pay for COMPASS services by expanding the capacity of the program due to the increased requests for assistance from the community.  Of the funds for the recipients, at least 60% of the funding will support households with an AMI at 50% or below and/or have a member of the household who has been unemployed for 90 days and up to 40% of the funding can be used for households with an AMI at 80% or below.\n \nThe Broad Street Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Ohio will continue to manage the program to provide assistance to residents in the local area who qualify for the assistance as provided in the laws, regulations, and other current guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury.  Assistance may include:  rent, rental arrearages, prospective rent, utility assistance, internet, security deposit, rental fees for storage unit, moving expenses, application fees, hotel or motel for displaced families, and/or eviction related court costs. \n \nIt is expected that the guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury will continue to be modified while this contract is in effect and it is requested that the Director of the Department of Development be given the authority to modify the terms and conditions of the contract without seeking additional Council Approval in order to align with the most current version of the laws, regulations, and guidance.  If additional funds are needed, Council approval will be requested.\n \nThese services are being contracted out as the Department does not have the resources to manage this program internally.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to have funding available as soon as possible to assist residents who are displaced or are facing immediate risk to their health and safety by remaining in unsafe conditions and to provide immediate assistance for transitional or permanent housing to prevent homelessness.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 passed by Congress and signed into law December 27, 2020, as authorized in Ordinance 2275-2021.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033793 and expires 08/03/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a Subrecipient Agreement - Not for Profit Service Contract with The Broad Street Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Ohio to add an amount up to $200,000.00 of federal Emergency Rental Assistance 2 (ERA 2) - Stable Housing Initiative funds to provide additional assistance as authorized by the federal Emergency Rental Assistance program; to authorize the Director of Development to modify the terms and conditions of the contract as needed without seeking further City Council approval; to authorize the advancement of funds; to authorize the expenditure of up to $200,000.00 from the Emergency Rental Assistance Funds; and to declare an emergency.
