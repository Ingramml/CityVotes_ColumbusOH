    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Human Resources to enter into contract with Baker Tilly US, LLP, further authorizes the expenditure of $149,700.00, and declares an emergency. \nIn 2023, the Human Resources Department/Office of Compensation Management went out to bid via RFP 023859 for consultation services to assist with a total compensation study. Consultation services are needed by the Department of Human Resources in order to ensure internal alignment of City of Columbus pay and jobs and to determine how the city’s current total compensation package might be updated to maintain competitiveness with comparable entities in both the public and private sectors which draw on a shared labor market. The RFP process was conducted in accordance with Columbus City Code Chapter 329. The Department of Human Resources reached out to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) regarding a potential DBE participation goal for this contract, but ODI made the determination to decline to assign a participation goal to this RFP.\nThe RFP team reviewed twelve proposals and interviewed the top five finalists. The five proposals from the top finalists were submitted by the following firms: \n1.                     Baker Tilly US, LLP\n2.                     Evergreen Solutions, LLC\n3.                     Crowe LLP\n4.                     The Segal Company\n5.                     CBIZ Compensation Consulting\nAfter careful consideration and evaluation, Baker Tilly US, LLP was selected by the RFP Team for the firm’s referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, and project approach.\nBaker Tilly US, LLP is an approved vendor with the City, with vendor compliance number CC-031806, expiration date 06/06/2025.The contract term is for eight months.\nEmergency action justification: Emergency action is requested to ensure the consultative services can begin as soon as possible to ensure internal alignment of City of Columbus pay and jobs and to determine how the city’s current total compensation package might be updated to maintain competitiveness with comparable entities in both the public and private sectors which draw on a shared labor market.
