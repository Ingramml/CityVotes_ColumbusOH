    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Director of Human Resources seeks the authority to modify and increase the contract currently in effect with the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP for collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.  The city entered into the original contract earlier this year (Ord. 0106-2023) to provide labor relations assistance because of their long history and experience representing the City of Columbus in negotiations with bargaining units.  Costs initially legislated, per Ordinance 0106-2023, totaled $300,000.00; this modification provides for additional expenses related to legal counsel for labor negotiations and related activities.  This legislation serves to increase the maximum obligation liability by $100,000.00, bringing the total contract obligation to $400,000.00. In addition, this ordinance serves to appropriate sufficient funds to allow this expenditure to occur.\nIt would not be in the City’s best interests to have additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes because the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP continues to bring a wealth of institutional knowledge and experience in ongoing labor negotiations and related activities with the City of Columbus and because the potential of changing outside legal counsel in the midst of collective bargaining negotiations would be detrimental to the City.  Costs associated with several ongoing negotiations were underestimated in the initial contract.  An analysis of year to date expenditures for the balance of the contract year supports this increase.  \nThis legislation authorizes the appropriation of $100,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the employee benefits fund, authorizes the Human Resources Department Director to modify and increase the current contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP by $100,000.00, and, further, authorizes the expenditure of the additional $100,000.00 to compensate for legal services rendered in conjunction with collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.   \nThe City Attorney has determined it appropriate and does approve of the use of Baker & Hostetler LLP for the purposes described in this ordinance, and for the purposes described in the original contract, which was authorized pursuant to Ordinance 0106-2023, adopted by City Council on January 30, 2023.\nFISCAL IMPACT:  Sufficient funds are available in the employee benefits fund for this additional appropriation and will be appropriated to the Department of Human Resources employee benefits administration subfund. \nBaker & Hostetler LLP's contract compliance number is 340082025.\n \nEmergency Action:  Emergency action is being requested to allow for continued representation by the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP in collective bargaining negotiations and related activities. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate $100,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the employee benefits fund; to authorize the Human Resources Director to modify and increase the existing contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP, for the provision of labor negotiation, legal consultation, and assistance; to authorize the additional expenditure of $100,000.00 from the employee benefits fund, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay the costs of said contract; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP was originally engaged to provide representation of the City of Columbus in conjunction with collective bargaining negotiations and related activities pursuant to Ordinance 0106-2023, adopted by City Council on January 30, 2023, for a maximum contractual obligation of $300,000.00; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to modify and increase the existing contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP due to unforeseen expenses, and to allow for the continued legal consultation  for  labor negotiations and related activities; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to add additional appropriation authority of $100,000.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to an additional $100,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay contract costs for legal counsel in labor negotiations and related activities; and\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to City Charter Sections 66 through 78 and Chapter 125 of the City Codes, the City Attorney has determined it appropriate and does approve of the use of Baker & Hostetler LLP for the purposes described in this ordinance, and for the purposes described in the original contract, which was authorized pursuant to Ordinance 0106-2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify and increase the existing contract amount with Baker & Hostetler LLP by $100,000.00 to ensure the city is provided legal counsel for current and upcoming labor negotiations and related activities, and to ensure the City is able to pay its outside legal counsel costs, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That from the monies in and from all monies estimated to come into the Employee Benefits Fund 5502, from any and all sources during the 12 months ending December 31, 2023, the following appropriations are hereby authorized and directed per the attachment.\n \nSECTION 2.
