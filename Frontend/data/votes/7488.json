    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into contract with Brennan Equipment Services Company dba Brennan Industrial Truck for one (1) forklift. This forklift will be utilized by the Department of Finance Fleet Division. RFQ025065 closed on 06/16/2023. There were five (5) bidders and the award was given to the Brennan as the third lowest bidder since OCTAIN provided an estimate of 52 weeks for delivery and Central Ohio did not have a satisfactory warranty policy or meet bid specifications.  Brennan was the best bid evaluated by responses to bid specifications, length of warranty and available delivery date: \n \nBrennan Industrial Truck Co. - $37,995.00\nCentral Ohio Forklifts Inc.  - $35,524.00\nOCTAIN Forklifts Inc. - $36,663.00\nTechnology International Inc. - $40,090.00\nOne Nation Distribution LLC - $49,950.00\n \nBrennan Industrial Truck Co. contract compliance number 34-4472715 expires 05/04/2025 \n \nFiscal Impact: A total of $37,995.00 will be spent from the Fleet Management Capital Fund 5205 and has been budgeted. \n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain.
