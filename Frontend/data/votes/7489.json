    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into contract with LESWEGO Corp. for two (2) mobile column lifts. These mobile column lifts will be utilized by the Department of Finance Fleet Division for the continued mission of optimal upkeep for all vehicles across several departments in the City of Columbus Fleet. RFQ025115 closed on 06/29/2023. There were four (4) bidders and the award was given to the LESWEGO Corp. It was the second lowest bidder but the lowest bidder did not meet bid specs, providing a ball and screw type lift while the specs required a hydraulic lift cylinder style. Leswego was selected as being the lowest and best bid response to bid specifications, length of warranty and available delivery date: \n \nARI Phoenix Inc. - $98,430.74\nLESWEGO Corp. - $101,881.40\nGenuine Parts Co / NAPA - $103,840.00\nTechnology International Inc. - $115,330.00\n \nLESWEGO Corp contract compliance number 34-4472715 expires 05/04/2025 \n \nFiscal Impact: A total of $101,881.40 will be spent from the Fleet Management Capital Fund 5205 and has been budgeted. \n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain.

Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet may ensure the pending purchase and delivery of these vehicles, which will not occur without this additional funding. \n  \nTitle\nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into contract with LESWEGO Corp. for two (2) mobile column lifts.; to authorize the expenditure of $101,881.40 from the Fleet Capital Fund; and to declare an emergency.
