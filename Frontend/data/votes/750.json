    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Williams Architects for the Glenwood and Windsor Swimming Pools Replacement Design Project. The contract amount is a not to exceed amount of $1,000,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Windsor Swimming Pool was originally built in 1968 and Glenwood Swimming Pool was built in 1973.  After serving the City of Columbus for more than fifty years, these aquatics facilities need to be replaced in order to function in an efficient and safe manner. Both pools will be improved to be more inclusive to persons with various abilities, meeting the requirements obtained by the public outreach activities which are part of the Recreation and Parks Department’s Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan. The bathhouse at Windsor, which was built in 2012, will undergo minor improvements as well. Both pools, in their current configuration, are limiting to programming based on their existing amenities. It is the intent of the design to increase the capacity of the pools for programs and to increase attendance.  In the most recent full season data totals from 2018 and 2019, Glenwood pool saw about 6600 and Windsor saw about 7000 pool visitors.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on March 5, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 25, 2021  Proposals were received from the following companies:\n \nMSA Design (MAJ)\nFeinknoph Macioce Schappa Architects, Inc.
