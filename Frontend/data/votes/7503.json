the Kerr Russell Inflow Redirection project, CIP #650790-113180, in an amount up to $6,973,087.14; to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction administration and inspection services in an amount up to $2,000.00 (for a total expenditure of $6,975,087.14); and seeks City Council approval to increase the maximum amount of a Water Pollution Control Loan Fund loan that will be used to fund construction of this project. \n \nThe work consists of approximately 2,349 feet of storm and sanitary sewer, 868 feet of CIPP lining of 36”/48” brick sewer, 827 feet of new 6”/8” water main, 1 new CSO structure, 984 square yards of permeable paver parking lane, and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract. \n \nOrdinance 3120-2022, passed 12/12/2022, authorized this project to be funded by a loan to be obtained through the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) loan account in an amount not to exceed $5,300,000.00.  That ordinance estimated the loan amount to cover the construction cost of the Kerr Russell Inflow Redirection project would be $5,300,000.00.  The actual construction cost for this project per the bids received is $6,973,087.14.  This ordinance seeks City Council approval to increase the maximum loan amount that can be sought for this project to $7,000,000.00 to cover the entire cost of construction and any additional administration costs that may be associated with seeking and administering the loan.   \n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 47, Italian Village.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 450 days from the date that a Notice To Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $6,973,087.14, including a 20% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                                   $6,973,087.14\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                                   $0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                                     $        2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                           $6,975,087.14\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project will provide renewed parking areas and street surfaces along parts of Kerr and Warren Streets.  There was significant coordination with the Italian Village Historical Association during design of the project.  The project will improve water quality by increasing the level of service of the Kerr Russell combined sewer regulator.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Public Sanitary Sewers for Kerr Russell Inflow Redirection project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express

code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \n7.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION \nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance as the loan award could be jeopardized by further delay, resulting in loss of funding for this project.\n \n8.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 3120-2022, passed by Council on 12/12/22.  The loan is expected to be approved in September, 2023.  Funds will need to be certified against the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to proceed with this project until the loan has been approved.\nFunds will need to be appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, transferred to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, and then appropriated in the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the WPCLF and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to reflect the loan funding for this project. \nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Complete General Construction Company for the Kerr Russell Inflow Redirection project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund to the Sanitary
