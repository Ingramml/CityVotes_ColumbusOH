    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance repeals and replaces Ordinance 1977-2023 to correct the funding source for this expenditure.  Ordinance 1977-2023 erroneously used Water Bond Funds for this expenditure when all capital expenditures related to the Fourth Water Plant are planned to be financed with loan funding. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for additional preliminary engineering services with ms consultants, inc. for the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project, CIP #690502-100001, in an amount up to $1,487,278.77.  The Ordinance also authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to apply for, accept, and enter into a Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) Loan Agreement with the Ohio Water Development Authority and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the financing of this contract modification.  \n \nThis contract is for additional engineering consulting services for the design of water transmission mains that will be constructed in conjunction with the construction of the City’s future fourth water plant. The transmission mains will extend from the fourth water plant located at 5992 Home Road, Delaware, Ohio,  to a strategic connection point in the City’s existing water distribution system, specifically the Cleveland/Henderson pressure district.  \n \nThe initial contract, Phase 1, is for preliminary design services.  This current modification is to add preliminary design services for new Scioto River/Griggs Reservoir crossing(s) into the Cleveland/Henderson pressure districts and associated transmission main alignment(s) to connect the Fourth Water Plant transmission mains.  The existing waterlines crossing the Scioto River do not have the capacity to convey flows from the future Fourth Water Plant based on projected plant capacity.  \n \nThere are two additional planned contract modifications.  One contract modification will be for Phase 2, detailed design services.  The final planned contract modification will be for Phase 3, engineering services during construction.\n \nThe majority of the transmission main will be located outside the City of Columbus.  The portion within the City of Columbus will be located within the Hayden Run Planning Area (30) and the Far Northwest Planning Area (31).  The Citywide Planning Area (99) will be used for the accounting template due to the project covering multiple areas.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:  The duration of the initial contract for Phase 1 - Preliminary Design Services is 18 months and is expected to begin in January, 2023.  The additional preliminary engineering services being added under the current modification will have the same schedule as the original contract for Phase 1 services.  Phase 2 - Detailed Design Services (Modification No. 1) is expected to have a duration of approximately 24 months.  Phase 3 - Engineering Services during Construction (Modification No. 2) is expected to have a duration of approximately 28 months.  \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,487,278.77\nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract (ORD 3235-2022; PO363148)                                                                 $5,399,068.91\nModification No.1 (Current)                                                                       $1,487,278.77 \nModification No. 2 (Future estimate)                                                                                 $10,000,000.00 \nModification No. 3 (Future estimate)                                                                 $2,500,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                $19,386,347.68 \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nAt the time of the original contract, the initial and ultimate capacities for the future Fourth Water Plant were unknown and it was assumed that the existing Scioto River/Griggs Reservoir water main crossings would be able to convey these flows throughout the 30 year planning horizon.  Demand/growth projections were updated and the sizing of the Fourth Water Plant was determined, resulting in the need to add river crossing(s) sooner than previously anticipated to be able to convey an adequate volume of flow from the Fourth Water Plant in to the Cleveland/Henderson pressure district.  As ms consultants inc. is familiar with the project it was deemed necessary to continue with the same consultant in order to ensure the expediency of the project.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nms consultants, inc. provided a cost proposal as requested by the City based on the scope of adding the river crossing(s) and associated transmission main(s) to the preliminary design of the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project.  The fee proposal was reviewed by the Division of Water deemed to be acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project has been scoped with a significant public outreach program.  This outreach program will include public meetings, advisory group briefings for stakeholders, development of a project website, fact sheets, pop-up engagement at neighborhood gatherings, e-newsletters, social media posts, and news releases.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION:  \nms consultants, inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006998 and expires 12/28/23.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against ms consultants, inc. or their subconsultants.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place with an ODI determined MBE/WBE program goal of 25.0%.  ms consultants, inc. is classified as a majority company.  ms consultants, inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 38.0%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, ms consultants, inc. has proposed the following subconsultants/subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                      City/State                         ODI Certification Status\nGresham Smith                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nMurphy Epson                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                               WBE\nResource International                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                               WBE\nAldea Services Inc.                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\nSTONE Environmental Engineering                      Columbus, Ohio                                                               WBE\n & Science\nMoody Engineering LLC                                           Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nEagon & Associates, Inc.                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\n7NT Engineering                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nRegency Construction Services, Inc.                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nDHDC Inc.                                                                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nCTL Engineering Inc.                                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nKTA Tator                                                                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nASC Group, Inc.                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nD&D Policy Works                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                               MAJ\n \nThe certification of ms consultants, inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5. FISCAL IMPACT\nThis design modification is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority.  Non-construction loans do not have a nomination deadline for pre-approval for this source of funding and are nominated as the need for financing arises.    \n \nThis Ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to appropriate and transfer funds from the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund, Fund 6011, in order to fund this proposed expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the Division is able to execute a loan with the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund and reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in September 2023.  The funds will also need to be appropriated in Fund 6011.   An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget will also be necessary.  \n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner to meet future anticipated water demands to prevent a water shortage and to avoid public health and welfare issues.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with ms consultants, inc. for the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project and to apply, accept, and enter into a Water Supply Revolving Loan Account loan agreement with the Ohio Water Development Authority and Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the financing thereof and designate a dedicated source of repayment for the loan;
