    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance is needed to authorize the Board of Health to enter into a sole-source supply contract with SciAps Inc for the purchase of two X-550 RoHS Analyzers and accessories in an amount not to exceed $71,886.00 to be used by the ODH-Public Health Lead Investigations grant program at Columbus Public Health.
