    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects.  ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is accepting applications to fund projects that address locations with a history of fatal or injury crashes where low-cost safety improvements have failed to solve the problem.  The Highway Safety Improvement Program accepts formal safety applications twice a year, on March 31 and August 31; and it accepts abbreviated safety applications four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.  These grants require a 10% local match.\n \nThis ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Service to execute project agreements for approved projects; to accept and expend grant funds; and to issue refunds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \n2.  EXPECTED PROJECTS\nThe Department of Public Service submitted applications for the project listed below:\n \n538017-100000 - Intersection - Hilliard Rome Rd at Renner Rd: This project includes modifications to the intersection of Hilliard Rome Road with Renner Road to mitigate crash patterns.  These modifications include widening the intersection approaches to allow for additional turn lanes as well as an upgrade of the traffic signal.  This is a formal safety application, and the total project cost is approximately $9,993,400.00.\n \n530086-100037 - Intersection Improvements - Refugee Rd at Hines Rd: This project includes modifications to mitigate crashes at the intersection of Hines Road with Refugee Road.  Improvements include widening of the Hines Road approach to include a southbound left-turn lane as well as the installation of a railroad preempted traffic signal.  These improvements will increase safety at this intersection by allowing turning vehicles a separate lane and coordinating the timing of the proposed traffic signal with the railroad immediately adjacent to the intersection.  This is a formal safety application, and the total project cost is approximately $3,250,000.00.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  Separate legislation authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of capital funds to support the local share of anticipated project costs will be put forth at a later date as needed.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) accepts formal applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds on March 31 and August 31; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT accepts abbreviated applications for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds four times a year, on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service has submitted applications seeking funds to construct roadway and pedestrian safety improvements at the intersection of Hilliard Rome Road at Renner Road and the intersection of Refugee Road at Hines Road; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to submit applications to, and to execute grant agreements with, ODOT, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute grant agreements with ODOT, to accept and expend awarded grant funds, and to issue refunds, if necessary, for approved projects; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit applications to, and to execute grant agreements, with the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the Highway Safety Improvement Program; and to accept and expend awarded grant funds.\n \nSECTION 2.  The Department of Public Service plans to submit applications for the projects listed above.  City Council understands and approves that this list may change at the discretion of the Director of Public Service if other projects are found to be good candidates to be awarded these grant funds or if a reason should be found not to submit one of the listed projects.\n \nSECTION 3.  The Department of Public Service is authorized to issue refunds of awarded or reimbursed grant funds, if necessary, after final accounting is performed or when notified by the Department of Public Service's Division of Design and Construction that a refund can be issued. \n \nSECTION 4.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which those funds originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
