    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) has issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for approximately $3.35 billion in discretionary grant funding through its Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods (RCN) program.  USDOT has combined its Reconnecting Communities Pilot (RCP) Program and its Neighborhood Access and Equity (NAE) Program into the RCN Program.  A portion of the NAE funding, approximately $450 million, will be awarded as Regional Partnerships Challenge Grants that are intended to address issues with a regional focus, and clearly demonstrate regional coordination and leveraging of local, State, and Federal resources and policies.  USDOT anticipates awarding $188 million to Community Planning Grants, $2.718 billion to Capital Construction Grants, and $450 million to Regional Partnerships Challenge Grants.  This is the second round of funding for USDOT’s RCP program, and it is the first - and potentially only - funding round for the NAE program.  The NOFO was released in July, and amended on August 21, 2023; and it will remain open only through September 28, 2023.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application under the RCN, and receive funding through either the RCP or NAE programs.  The Department of Public Service is working on a RCN opportunity application with the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) in support of the W. Broad Street Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor project.  In addition to constructing the BRT on W. Broad Street, it would also ensure there are complete streets and active transportation facilities along the entire W. Broad Street BRT corridor.  COTA is the lead agency responsible for the construction of this work, which is estimated to cost approximately $339.5 million.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally submit an application under the RCN opportunity as either the lead applicant or joint applicant.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USDOT, COTA, or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNAE grants may be used for up to 80 percent (80%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with an application prior to the application period’s end.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to solely or jointly submit a grant application to the United States Department of Transportation through the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods program; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Transportation and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced the first round of the Reconnecting Communities and Neighborhoods (RCN) program, which is an opportunity to award discretionary funds on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDOT is accepting applications for the current funding round through September 28, 2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City intends to partner with other interested stakeholders, including the Central Ohio Transit Agency (COTA), to submit a funding application for the W. Broad Street Bus Rapid Transit project; and\n \nWHEREAS, the interested stakeholders have yet to identify the most appropriate lead applicant and primary award beneficiary, but the City of Columbus will be involved in the application process and the use of the funds if awarded; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to prepare and submit the aforesaid grant application prior to the end of the application period for the facilitation of the W. Broad Street Bus Rapid Transit project and the benefit of the traveling public, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to solely or jointly submit an RCN application for a grant from USDOT; to accept said grant, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said application, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to identify COTA as the primary recipient of any grant award received through this opportunity, and to execute any agreement or other documents necessary to effectuate designating COTA as the primary award recipient if the final application scope involves work where COTA is the primary agency responsible for construction.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to execute any agreement or other documents necessary to effectuate the RCN application if a more appropriate lead applicant is identified to submit an application to USDOT concerning the W. Broad Street BRT project and related local projects.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 5.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
