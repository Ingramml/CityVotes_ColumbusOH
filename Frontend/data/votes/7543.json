    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless in support of the Central Ohio Restored Citizens’ Collaborative for sponsorship of their reentry services in 2023.\n \nFor over a decade, the Central Ohio Restored Citizens’ Collaborative (CORCC) has provided community-based reentry resources and reintegration support for thousands of returning citizens. Beginning over 12 years ago with the signature Central Ohio Restored Citizens’ Summit, annual events have allowed CORCC to provide programming related to the reentry experience, assemble resources and stakeholders, as well as honor leaders in the field who are justice-involved or support those that are justice-involved. \n \nSince then, thematic-based events have expanded to emphasize second-chance employment, responsible parenting, and a mission of changing the narrative surrounding criminal justice. These events now take place throughout Central Ohio and have expanded to over thirty varying events each year.\n \nThe most recent addition to the portfolio of resource provision includes restorative housing. For residents of Columbus who are not sentenced to prison, placed on county supervision, or do not have risk factors that are affiliated with subsidized housing options, their ability to find safe, stable housing is significantly limited. By meeting residents where they are, CORCC has created additional pathways out of poverty, connections to good-paying jobs and, through a variety of programming, have aided in the creation of safer neighborhoods through empathic storytelling, community building, and the creation of economic mobility and sustainability.\n \nFiscal Impact: The funding of $35,000.00 is available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Coalition for the Homeless in support of the Central Ohio Restored Citizens’ Collaborative for sponsorship of their reentry services in 2023; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund. ($35,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Central Ohio Restored Citizens’ Collaborative (CORCC) has provided community-based reentry resources and reintegration support for thousands of returning citizens; and\n \nWHEREAS, annual events have allowed CORCC to provide programming related to the reentry experience, assemble resources and stakeholders, as well as honor leaders in the field who are justice-involved or support those that are justice-involved; and\n \nWHEREAS, thematic-based events have expanded to emphasize second-chance employment, responsible parenting, and a mission of changing the narrative surrounding criminal justice; and\n \nWHEREAS, the most recent addition to the portfolio of resource provision includes restorative housing; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
