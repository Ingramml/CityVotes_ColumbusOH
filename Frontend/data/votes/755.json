    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), to enter into contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation for software licensing, maintenance, and support with Accela, Inc., for the period May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022, in the amount of $469,100.66 This is being done on behalf of the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Development, Public Utilities, and Public Service.\n \nThe original contract for this software (CT17745) was awarded to Open Data Systems as a solution for tracking building permit activity. The annual contract was then transferred to Accela, Inc. in 2001 when Open Data Systems was acquired under ordinance 1754-01, which passed October 22, 2001. The most recent contract for Accela licensing, maintenance and support was authorized by ordinance 2557-2020, (passed November 23, 2020), which authorized a three month contract, ending on April 30, 2021. This ordinance authorizes a new contract, beginning on May 1st, 2021 and ending on April 30, 2022.\n \nPassage of this ordinance will ensure continuation of software maintenance and support services for Accela systems, used by the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Development, Public Utilities, and Public Service. Services provided through this contract include technical assistance, support, upgrades and telephone support services for the Accela Automation System application, used to issue building permits, track code enforcement activities and monitor the performance of the One Stop Shop. Without the passage of this legislation, the Department of Technology will lose the ability to maintain the city’s permitting system, removing the ability to provide web access for building permits, data and information utilized by citizens regarding issues such as building permits and inspections\n \nThis ordinance also waives the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes. DoT is unable to use the STS due to change/new SKUs to a GSA-derived ST. A vendor files their new GSA SKUs and price with the state, and the state reviews, approves and amends the STS. Without the GSA SKUs, the state lacks authority under its waiver of competitive selection to amend its STS. The new SKUs we need under Accela has not yet been established under GSA\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $469,100.66 for the above-described purpose.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nIn 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 the department legislated $336,572.44, $356,197.62, $415,106.86, and $115,587.04 respectively for Accela software licensing, maintenance, and support.  The current contract, which expires on April 30th, 2021, was legislated for a three (3) month term, which began on January 31, 2021, at a cost of $115,587. This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $469,100.66 to ensure continuation of Accela services. The funds for this contract are budgeted and available, the majority of which are budgeted in the DoT “direct charge” budgets of the user agencies.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to expedite authorization of this contract to ensure continuation of services from the supplier.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Carahsoft Technology Corp CC#: 52-2189693 Expiration Date: 5/4/2022 (DAX Vendor Account # 009115)\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Carahsoft Technology Corporation for the purchase of Accela software licensing and maintenance and support services on behalf of the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Development, Public Utilities, and Public Service; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $469,100.66 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
