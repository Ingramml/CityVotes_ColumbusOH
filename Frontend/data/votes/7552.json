The purpose of the Baby and Me Tobacco Free Program (BMTF), an evidence-based program, is to increase smoking cessation rates among pregnant and postpartum women by offering individualized tobacco cessation treatment and incentives.

CPH is responsible for the management of staff person who will participate in the Baby and Me Tobacco Free Program housed at Columbus Public Health, providing training for OBBO prenatal clinic staff on the process for referring pregnant patients to the Baby and Me Tobacco Free Program, and reporting program specific metrics to OBBO on a monthly basis. \nSince its inception in 2014, the Baby & Me Tobacco Free Program at CPH has become the largest perinatal smoking cessation program in Ohio.
