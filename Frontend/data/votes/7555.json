    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify the existing contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. for EMS billing, collection, and reporting services.  The Public Safety Department entered into a contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. via ordinance 1163-2023, passed May 22, 2023.  The purpose of the contract is for EMS billing, collection, patient care reporting, hardware devices, accompanying extra equipment, third party auditing, training, and onsite personnel as needed for the Division of Fire's Third Party EMS Reimbursement Program.  The reimbursement program originated via Ordinance #1184-02, passed July 22, 2002.  Public Safety contracts the services of Change Healthcare for the billing, collection, and reporting of those who are transported to hospitals by EMS personnel for emergency medical care.  These billing, collection, and reporting services have generated a multitude of patient care information used by the Fire Division to better prepare EMS response protocols and, in turn, respond to citizens in a more effective manner.  The division also generates reports for various fire organizations that are catalogued nationwide.  Revenue generated since inception of the program in 2002 amounted to over $270 million at the end of December 2022 and is deposited in the city's General Fund.    \n \nThe need for additional funds was a known possibility at the time of the initial contract as costs fluctuate with, and are driven directly by EMS revenue collection.  Other procurement processes are not being utilized due to the fact that work under this renewal is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original contract.\n \nContract Compliance:   Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. FID 23-2939847 / vendor #025233\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested so that EMS billing, collection, and reporting services can continue without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This legislation seeks to modify the current contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. for billing and collection services.  It also authorizes a $600,000.00 transfer within and expenditure from Public Safety’s general operating fund in order to fund the aforementioned services.  Of $1,500,000.00 that was budgeted for this expense in 2023, approximately $1,000,000.00 has been expended thus far.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify the existing contract with Change Healthcare Practice Management Solutions, Inc. for EMS billing, collection, and reporting services for the Division of Fire; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer of $600,000.00 within the General Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $600,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
