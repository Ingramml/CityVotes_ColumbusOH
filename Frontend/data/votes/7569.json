    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:                     \n \nThis Ordinance is submitted to settle the lawsuit captioned Scott Osborn v. City of Columbus, et al., United States District Court Case No. 2:20-cv-1229, in the amount of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00). On or about February 13, 2019, CPD Officers Jesse Smith and Elijah Ladipo responded to the scene of a single car auto accident where the driver had collided with multiple unoccupied vehicles. Upon arrival, these officers quickly attempted to detain the driver, Plaintiff, in an effort to investigate the collision and because of his erratic behavior. Plaintiff resisted this detention and obstructed official business by putting his hands on the officers and by kicking them. Officers Ladipo and Jesse Smith deployed uses of force at level 0 verbal communication, level 1 takedown and joint manipulation, and level 4 punches in order to successfully detain Plaintiff. Plaintiff was charged with resisting arrest and obstructing official business and was later convicted of the latter. Following his vehicle accident and interaction with CPD, Plaintiff was transported to the emergency department and was found to have injuries to his face and eye along with broken ribs.  Mr. Osborn’s lawsuit named Columbus Police Officers Elijah Ladipo and Jesse Smith as defendants. Mr. Osborn alleges, among other things, that (a) Officers Ladipo and Jesse Smith used excessive and unreasonable force when detaining him on February 13, 2019 in violation of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights; (b) Officers Ladipo and Jesse Smith committed state law assault and battery and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon Plaintiff when detaining him; and (c) he suffered damages.  \nFiscal Impact:                     \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the settlement of a lawsuit captioned Scott Osborn v.
