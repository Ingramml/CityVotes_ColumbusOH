    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the transfer and appropriation of $101,266.00 within the general fund to support the Franklin County Municipal Court’s Pretrial and Probation Service’s Specialized Enforcement and Response Team (SERT) and the Environmental Court’s Environmental Specialists.  \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Fleet Management Division on behalf of the Administrating and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to establish a purchase order for one vehicle from Ricart Properties Inc. This vehicle will be utilized by the Franklin County Municipal Court’s SERT Unit to conduct fieldwork.\n \nThe Court's SERT Unit was established as part of the Blueprint for Safety initiative. In its inception, the Court collaborated with the Columbus Police Department (CPD) and Franklin County's Sheriff's Office (FCSO) to undertake field supervision and execute warrant checks. The primary mandate of the SERT Unit is to oversee individuals considered to be at the highest risk for domestic violence and violent offenses. This responsibility encompasses conducting field visits to the residences, workplaces, and other relevant locations of these offenders to ensure the safety of both victims and the community.\nIn close coordination with Victim Assistants, the SERT Unit further extends its reach by conducting in-person field interactions with all associated victims monthly or as circumstances dictate, thereby guaranteeing their well-being and compliance with the Court's directives. The SERT Unit is staffed with a team comprising one supervisor, one assistant supervisor, and five dedicated SERT Probation officers, making for a total of seven officers serving within the unit. This funding will provide materials and services to maximize their safety while allowing them to interact with the offenders, victims, and the community.\nThe Environmental Court Specialists perform field investigation services for the Environmental Division as part of their duties, as well as any other duties that the Environmental Division Judge prescribes.  Conducting field investigation services routinely places Environmental Specialists in exceptionally dangerous circumstances.  These situations include but are not limited to investigating properties used for illegal felony drug manufacturing and distribution, violent activity, organized crime, human trafficking, deployment of dangerous animals, and public nuisance activities.  This funding will provide materials to maximize their safety when engaged in these inherently dangerous situations.\nThe funding provided will ensure safety for the community and for the SERT Unit and Environment Specialists while also better mobilizing the SERT Team for interaction with the offenders, victims, and the community. The intent of these funds is to provide for one vehicle and the purchase of materials, supplies, and services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The funds are available in the 2023 general fund budget.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $101,266.00 within the general fund; to authorize the Fleet Management Division on behalf of the Administrating and Presiding Judge of the Franklin County Municipal Court to establish a purchase order for one vehicle from Ricart Properties Inc; to authorize the expenditure of up to $40,000.00 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency.
