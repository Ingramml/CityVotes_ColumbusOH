    "description": "Title\nTo declare October 2023 as Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the City of Columbus, and to recognize the American Cancer Society for its advocacy and efforts to raise awareness and critical funds regarding breast cancer in Columbus and Central Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, 1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. In 2023, an estimated 297,790 women and 2,800 men will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer as well as 55,720 new cases of non-invasive breast cancer; and\n \nWHEREAS, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. The median age at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is 62; and\n \nWHEREAS, about 5-10% of breast cancers can be linked to known gene mutations inherited from one’s mother or father. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most common. On average, women with a BRCA1 mutation have up to a 72% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. For women with a BRCA2 mutation, the risk is 69%. Breast cancer that is positive for the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations tends to develop more often in younger women. An increased ovarian cancer risk is also associated with these genetic mutations. In men, BRCA2 mutations are associated with a lifetime breast cancer risk of about 6.8%; BRCA1 mutations are a less frequent cause of breast cancer in men; and\n \nWHEREAS, breast cancer death rates have been decreasing steadily since 1989, due to increased awareness, improved treatment options, as well as improved mammography screenings, which helps detect breast cancer early; and\n \nWHEREAS, there have been numerous studies which have shown that early detection saves lives and increases the options for treatment; and\n \nWHEREAS, one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and although it’s the second most diagnosed cancer in women behind skin cancer, the five-year survival rate is more than 90 percent for breast cancers detected early thanks to enhanced screening and prevention methods. There are more than 4 million breast cancer survivors in the United States today; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize the importance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month and salutes the American Cancer Society for their continuous work to raise awareness and critical funds regarding breast cancer in Columbus, Ohio, and throughout the country.",
