S. Treasury) to qualifying residents of the local community for up to 12 months plus an additional three months, if necessary, to ensure housing stability.\n \nIn this subrecipient agreement, at least 60% of the funding will support households with an AMI at 50% or below and/or have a member of the household who has been unemployed for 90 days; up to 40% of the funding can be used for households with an AMI at 80% or below; and 10% of the funding will be utilized for Administrative costs. \n \nCUL will manage a program to provide rental and utility assistance to residents in the local area who qualify for the assistance as provided in the laws regulations and other current guidance provided by the U.

The organization uniquely responds to the crises that trap families in poverty holistically, using intelligence, compassion, innovation, and an understanding that comes only from having truly walked a mile in their client’s shoes. \n \nThe services included in this subrecipient agreement cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested to address the impacts of the COVID-19 health emergency.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided to the City of Columbus from the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 passed by Congress and signed into law December 27, 2020, and is available in the department’s ERA budget. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor’s vendor number is 006073 and is valid from 4/24/2020-4/24/2022\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to enter into a subrecipient agreement with the Columbus Urban League in an amount up to $3,000,000.00 to provide rental and utility assistance (as defined by U.
