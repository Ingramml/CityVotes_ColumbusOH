    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten education for every 4-year-old.  Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.  \n \nChildren who participate in high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills.  Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate. \n \nThrough Early Start Columbus (ESC), the Office of Education provides high-quality pre-kindergarten services to children throughout the City.  ESC is however, only one of many efforts working to increase the kindergarten readiness scores of children in Franklin County.\n \nEarly Care and Learning, Inc, (ECAL) operates the Caring Communities, a birth to age three program that utilizes mixed-age group classrooms to provide a continuity of care approach to center-based early learning.  The program operates in 17 centers across the city, all of which are ESC centers. The program is expanding into ten (10) additional classrooms across the city this year and has plans to continue that expansion over the next several years.\n \nThis contract will be entered into in compliance with relevant procurement provisions of the Columbus City Codes Section 329.30.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $45,000.00 from the 2023 Office of Education’s General Fund operating budget.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a contract with Early Care and Learning, Inc, (ECAL), a non-profit organization that specializes in creating continuums of early education; and to authorize the expenditure of $45,000.00 from the General Fund.
