P4S will leverage their existing relationships to deepen and expand partnerships by coordinating educational opportunities and youth service programming in response to the unprecedented crises exacerbated by a global pandemic. The P4S collective impact approach is designed to position all stakeholders to align around a common equity-driven agenda.\n \nThis ordinance will fund a portion of the foundational P4S work, including:\n \n1.                     P4S Community of Practice.  P4S will provide partners access to a comprehensive toolbox of social emotional assessment technology and implementation resources tailored to the unique context of each provider setting;\n2.                     P4S Work Groups & Workshops.  P4S will convene workgroups and workshops on six different focus areas: Adult SEL, Data & Continuous Improvement, Family & Community Engagement, Middle & High School Youth, Youth & Young Adult Workforce Readiness, and Young People of Color; \n3.                     P4S Facilitator Project. The P4S Facilitator Project initiative will increase the number of skilled facilitators to lead equity-centered collective impact that increases social, emotional, and academic outcomes; \n4.                     Adaptive Schools - Organizations Foundation Seminar.  This seminar will  present a productive, practical set of ideas and tools for developing collaborative groups in becoming effective and better equipped to resolve the complex issues associated with improving social, emotional, and academic outcomes for young people; \n5.                     Cognitive Coaching.  The P4S Cognitive Coaching supports individuals and organizations in becoming self-directed, self-monitoring, and self-managing.
