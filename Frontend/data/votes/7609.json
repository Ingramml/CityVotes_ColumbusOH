It is believed that this level of support provided during their critical formative years, guides our youth into their full untapped potential, with this movement highlighting the need for a more equitable and prosperous future, spearheading our youth into being empowered girls of today, and groundbreaking leaders of tomorrow; and,\n \nWHEREAS, On July 16, 2018, Columbus City Council adopted resolution number 0208X-2018 to create the Commission on Black Girls Led by then City Councilmember Priscilla Tyson - The Commission's focus is to change the life trajectory of Black women starting early in the lives of Black girls to create opportunities to improve their futures; and the Commission on Black Girls has transitioned to the Department of Neighborhoods continuing its work to advance equity for Black girls; and,\n \nWHEREAS, In honor of International Day of the Girl, the Columbus City Council and The Commission on Black Girls recognize the impactful Brown Girls Mentoring program, empowering brown girls in alignment with Commission recommendations and offering safe spaces, leadership curricula, empowering presentations, and opportunities for black girls to lead; and,\n \nWHEREAS, girls, including those with disabilities and from marginalized communities, break stereotypes to become future leaders; Now, therefore:\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: This Council does hereby recognize Brown Girls Mentoring for its program and celebrate October 11, 2023, as the International Day of the Girl in the City of Columbus.",
