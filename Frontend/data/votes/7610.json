    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and designate October 8-14, 2023 as Fire Prevention Week in Columbus, Ohio.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is committed to ensuring the safety and security of all those living in and visiting Columbus. Fire is a serious public safety concern both locally and nationally, and homes are the locations where people are at greatest risk from fire; and\n \nWHEREAS, home fires killed more than 2,800 people in the United States in 2021, according to the National Fire Protection Association, and fire departments in the United States responded to 338,000 home fires; and\n \nWHEREAS, cooking is the leading cause of home fires in the United States and fire departments responded to more than 166,400 annually between 2016 and 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, two of five home fires start in the kitchen with 31% of these fires resulting from unattended cooking; and\n \nWHEREAS, more than half of reported non-fatal home cooking fire injuries occurred when the victims tried to fight the fire themselves; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus residents should turn pot handles toward the back of the stove; always keep a lid nearby when cooking; keep a three-foot kid-free zone around the stove, oven and other things that could get hot; watch what they heat; and set a timer to remind them that they are cooking; and\n \nWHEREAS, everyone should make a home escape plan, drawing a map of each level of the home, showing all doors and windows. Those who have planned and practiced a home fire escape plan are more prepared and will therefore be more likely to survive a fire; and                     \n \nWHEREAS, everyone in the home should know how to call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number from a cell phone or a neighbor’s phone; and\n \nWHEREAS, the 2023 Fire Prevention Week theme, “Cooking safety starts with YOU. Pay attention to fire prevention,” effectively serves to remind us to stay alert and use caution when cooking to reduce the risk of kitchen fires; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and designate October 8-14, 2023 as Fire Prevention Week throughout this city, and urges all residents of Columbus to check their kitchens for fire hazards, use safe cooking practices, and to support the many public safety efforts of the Columbus Division of Fire and emergency services during Fire Prevention Week 2023.",
