    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: \n \nChapter 1710 of the Ohio Revised Code, effective September 29, 1994 provides for the creation of Special Improvement Districts (District), by non-profit corporations governed by trustees elected by the property owners for the provision of special services in a designated district. The East Main Street Special Improvement District (the SID or District) was created in 2018 for a term of 5 years through 2022. The District was renewed for a second five-year term through 2027.\n \nIn 2023, City Council authorized ordinance #1457-2023, a boundary adjustment of three parcels from the city of Columbus to the city of Whitehall. These parcels were included in the East Main Street Special Improvement District when they were a part of the City of Columbus. However, now that the parcels are part of the City of Whitehall, the parcels must be removed from the East Main Street Special Improvement District. This is necessary so that the parcels are no longer subjected to the additional levy imposed on properties in the East Main Street Special Improvement District.\n \nFiscal Impact: $0.00\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to remove parcels 10-087538, 010-217331, and 010-217330 from the East Main Street Special Improvement District.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Council has approved Ordinance No.1457-2023 authorizing the boundary adjustment which moves parcels 10-087538, 010-217331, and 010-217330 from the City of Columbus to the City of Whitehall; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council  approved the reauthorization of the East Main Street Special Improvement District in Ordinance No. 2053-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, removing these three parcels still maintains the approval of sixty per cent of the front footage of all real property located in the East Main Street Special Improvement District as required by Ohio Revised Code Section 1710.02; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) or his or her designee on behalf of the City is hereby authorized to remove parcels 10-087538, 010-217331, and 010-217330 from the East Main Street Special Improvement District upon completion of the boundary adjustment process.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) or his or her designee on behalf of the City is hereby authorized to inform the Franklin County Auditor that these parcels are hereby removed from the East Main Street Special Improvement District and should no longer be subject to the additional levy imposed on these parcels upon completion of the boundary adjustment process.\n \nSECTION 3.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
