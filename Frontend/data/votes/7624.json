    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to return unused funds associated with G601314 Joyce Avenue Phase 2 CCY05 project back to the Department of Public Utilities in project P610782-100000 60-15 Linworth/Meeklynn SSI.\n \nOrdinance 0697-2014 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into contract with Shelly and Sands, Inc. for the construction of the Operation Safewalks - Joyce Avenue Phase 2 project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services utilizing funds from the Department of Public Service (DPS), Department of Public Utilities (DPU) and grant funds from the Ohio Public Works Commission.\n \nThis ordinance allows for the transfer of unused funds from grant number G601314 Joyce Avenue Phase 2 CCY05 to P610782-100000 60-15 Linworth/Meeklynn SSI in order to complete final accounting and close the grant out.  Design and right-of-way costs were paid for with DPS and DPU funding but were eligible for reimbursement.  Reimbursements were requested and received for both design and right-of-way leaving a positive cash balance in the grant.  Additionally, the estimated city share was lower than expected due to project underruns resulting in too much DPU funding being transferred into the grant at the time the project was legislated.\n \nThis project has been completed.  Final accounting reconciliation determined the cash remaining in the grant is to be distributed back to the Department of Public Utilities in the amount of $298,970.70.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $298,970.70 are available for transfer from Fund 6206, the Storm Sewer Grant Fund in G601314 (Joyce Ave Phase 2 CCY05) to Fund 6204, the Storm Sewer Voted Capital Fund, P610782-100000 60-15 Linworth/Meeklynn SSI.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds between the Storm Sewer Grant Fund and Storm Sewer Voted Capital Fund in connection with the Joyce Avenue Phase 2 project.
