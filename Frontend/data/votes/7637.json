    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes an appropriation in support of an educational campaign for the general public on the Columbus districts. \nIn December 2021, Columbus City Council selected the first Official Council District Map. This map created city-wide representation for all residents by creating geographic diversity in where councilmembers reside. This November, residents will head to the polls and vote for the districts for the first time. It is imperative that residents be educated on how to use this new system and how it will affect them and their families. Funding will be utilized to engage various media outlets to disseminate district information via print, radio, online media, and/or television.\nFiscal impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in ensuring that residents are properly informed regarding the new districts. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize an appropriation within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund in support of an educational campaign for the general public on the Columbus districts; and to declare an emergency.
