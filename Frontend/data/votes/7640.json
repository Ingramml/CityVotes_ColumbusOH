    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department modify an existing contract with The EDGE Group, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the Ulry Warner Parkland Improvements Design Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $105,000.00.\n \nThis ordinance will enable Recreation and Parks to complete construction of a 53 acre park in the city’s far northeast area.  The site was acquired in 2013 for a future community park for thousands of residents in one of the city’s fastest growing communities. The parkland has been on the community’s highest priority list for development. Funds for this project are being provided by the Department of Development Albany Crossing and Upper Albany West Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Funds as well as the Central College Community Development Authority project account within the Department of Development Hamilton-Central College TIF Fund. Parkland Dedication Funding within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund is also being used to fund the construction and inspection of the new park. This ordinance is providing additional funding from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund. \n \nImprovements for this park project include athletic fields, as well as, hard courts for pickleball and futsal. This project also provides walking paths, natural play spaces, a four season reservable pavilion, parking areas, utility services, four path connections to the surrounding communities, forest preservation, and forest expansion. \n \nThis modification covers additional fees needed for the construction phase of the project. These fees were incurred as a result of a recognized opportunity to save project costs using value engineering of the construction documents. This scope of work includes the services to value engineer portions of the project for an overall project savings in excess of $300,000.00. \n \nModifying EDGE's contract provides the most cost effective and time efficient method for progressing through construction versus hiring a new consultant. EDGE has up to this point been engaged in all of the background and understanding of the project, so they are able to respond to the contractor’s questions most effectively. Their fee was negotiated using estimated hours and previously established contract costs for personnel involved in the project. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nEDGE Group, Inc.\n330 West Spring Street, Suite 350\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nTedd Hardesty, (614) 486-3343\nContract Compliance Number, Tax ID: 001500\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: April 28, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the project is ongoing and this will allow EDGE Group, Inc. to provide the additional construction administration services needed to keep the project on schedule.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Ulry Warner Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the entire far northeast region of Central Ohio. The scale of the park will accommodate a wide range of recreation for all ages, and will be accessible to over 4,000 nearby residents. Future subdivision projects underway will add an additional 1,000 residents to the walkshed within the next 3 years.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Recreation and Parks has engaged with the community and the TIF committee since 2014. Civic groups involved include Asherton Grove HOA, Upper Albany West, and Albany Crossing. Two new large subdivisions are currently under construction surrounding the park space.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Rocky Fork-Blacklick (33)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks, trails, and easy multi-generational connectivity for Columbus residents. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $539,196.16 was legislated for professional services for the Ulry Warner Park Improvements Project by Ordinances 0915-2020 and 0327-2021.
