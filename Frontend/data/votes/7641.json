    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Builderscape, Inc. for the Linview Park Improvements 2023 Project. The contract amount is $390,013.00, with a contingency of $39,987.00, for a total of $430,000.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $432,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThis project is part of an ongoing collaboration between the Department of Public Utilities Blueprint Program and the Recreation and Parks Department. The site is located at Fern Place and Linview Avenue on the border of the Northeast Area and North Linden Area. Public Utilities has developed this site to serve as a regional detention basin, strengthening the local watershed and environment. This green infrastructure is typically inaccessible and not conducive to recreation. In order to connect residents with this important infrastructure while capitalizing on the area's scarce green space, Recreation and Parks will install a shelter, playground, picnic tables, benches, lighting, and other park amenities. This completed project will enable residents to recreate, enjoy Blueprint's stormwater infrastructure, and connect with nature. With Council approval, this project will start in fall 2023 and complete all punch list items by fall 2024.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 25, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 15, 2023.
