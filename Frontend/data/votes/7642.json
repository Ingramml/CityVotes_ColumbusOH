    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Archer Corporation and authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Red Vest Supply, LLC, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, for the Main Entry Signage Program 2023 Project. The Archer Corporation contract amount is $22,391.55, with a contingency of $27,608.45, for a total of $50,000.00 for the service portion of this project. The Red Vest Supply contract amount is $22,196.80 and is for the supply portion of this project. There is a total of $72,196.80 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Recreation and Department has over 400 parks and facilities combined, which include main park entry signs that greet residents into the parks and facilities. Main park entry signs are essential in strengthening the Recreation and Parks Department’s identity. These signs also help residents and emergency services locate parks and facilities. Staff have identified at least 12 park entry signs in critical need of replacement due to various types of damage or being at the end of their useful service life. Currently, most existing main park signs do not include a park or facility address, which presents an issue for emergency situations. This phase of the project is proposed to replace the 12 signs, all of which will include the park or facility address. Replacing damaged signs with new signs containing the park and facility addresses will enhance the public’s ability to understand park locations and communicate that information with other residents and emergency services. Archer Corporation will replace damaged and aged signs with new ones. The raw sign material is being procured for sign installations, separate from the service contract, for cost savings. The procurement for the sign panel material was bid through the Purchasing Office.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nSign Replacement Services:\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329 via RFQ025461, on July 20, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 15, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nArcher Corporation (MAJ): $22,391.55\nDaNite Sign Company (MAJ): $38,427.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Archer Corporation was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Archer Corporation and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nRaw Sign Material:\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329 via RFQ025536, on July 28, 2023 and received by the Finance and Management Department on August 15, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nRed Vest Supply Inc. (MAJ): $22,196.80\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Red Vest Supply was the lowest and most responsive bidder that did meet specifications. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \n \nArcher Corporation\n1917 Henry Ave SW\nCanton, Ohio 44706 \nGina Cope, (330) 455-9995                                                 \nContract Compliance Number: 045772\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: June 20, 2025\n \nRed Vest Supply LLC\n604 Jett Street\nWest Portsmouth, Ohio 45663 \nMichael Lackey, (740) 357-7375\nContract Compliance Number: 041570\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: April 18, 2024\n \nBenefits to the Public: Main park entry signs serve an important role in strengthening the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s identity and in helping residents locate parks and facilities. Main park signs are often the first amenity that residents see when entering a park and set the tone for the experience the resident can expect. Main park signs that are warped, faded, and/or damaged do not set the best tone for a park user’s experience. Replacing critically damaged signs with new signs enhance park user’s ability to communicate that information with other residents and/or emergency service providers. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community members have shared main park sign concerns and replacement requests through 311 calls and through other forms of communication. Staff have also visually inspected all main park signs and have prioritized the top 24 signs that are in most need of replacement.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by removing access and circulation barriers to City parks by improving main park sign design. It also improves overall maintenance, safety, and design standards. \n \nFiscal Impact: $72,196.80 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of these expenditures. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with Archer Corporation and the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Red Vest Supply, LLC, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, for the Main Entry Signage Program 2023 Project; to authorize the transfer of $72,196.80 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; and to authorize the expenditure of $72,196.80 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund.
