    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with G6 Infrastructure, LLC for the Mudsock Trail Safety Improvements Project. The contract amount is for a total of $74,725.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Mudsock Trail is a limestone screenings path in the City’s Far West Community. The two and a half mile trail begins at Franks Park and currently ends at Spindler Park. The primary purpose of the project is to address drainage issues along the trail at nine locations where periodic flooding from the Clover Groff Stream creates unsafe conditions for walkers, runners, and cyclists. The project will install several small culverts and raise the grade of the path with new limestone screenings to reduce further flooding impacts.  \n \nThe Mudsock Trail is well used, with over 2,800 residents living close to the path. The path also connects users to the active recreation of Franks Park, Spindler Dog Park, and Spindler Park Soccer Complex. These are all popular and heavily used greenspaces. The timing of the project is to begin as soon as possible during the fall months to take advantage of drier weather conditions.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on June 29, 2023, and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 3, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nG6 Infrastructure, LLC (MAJ): $74,725.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that G6 Infrastructure, LLC was the lowest and most responsive bidder. G6 Infrastructure, LLC and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nG6 Infrastructure, LLC\n1683 Woodlands Drive, Suite E\nMaumee, Ohio 43537\nJudd Gleason, (419) 392-3720, judd@g6-inf.com                                                  \nContract Compliance Number: 046799\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: September 27, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to begin as soon as possible during the fall months of the year, taking advantage of drier weather conditions and minimizing the impact to trail users.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The Mudsock Trail was built during the two phases of Clover Groff Stream Restoration in 2006 and 2009. The path and the stream are within the Big Darby Watershed, a nationally sensitive ecological waterway area, and the use of limestone screenings is an approved surface to lessen the runoff in comparison to hard pavement. The trail is part of the Central Ohio Greenways network and is planned to connect to the Big Darby Trail near Galloway.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During the past three years, the Department has received many comments from the public about impassability and damage being done in flooded sections of the path.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far West (36)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors. It will also improve the environmental health of the city’s waterways, improve recreational access to streams, provide long term protection corridors for water quality, and trail improvements. \n \nFiscal Impact: $74,725.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into contract with G6 Infrastructure, LLC for the Mudsock Trail Safety Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $74,725.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $74,725.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
