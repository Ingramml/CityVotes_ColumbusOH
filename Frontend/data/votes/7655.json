The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed a request by the owners of the Servient Estate to vacate a 0.109 acre portion of the existing Easement and determined that the portion of the Easement is no longer needed as a new easement has been recorded in Instrument Number 202308300089082.
