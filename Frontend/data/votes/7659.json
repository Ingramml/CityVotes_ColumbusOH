    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $600,000.00 of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grants ($100,000.00 from the 2022 grant and $500,000.00 from the 2023 grant) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, and restrictive covenant with Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio to construct six single family homes.  Each address would have its own set of loan documents.\n \nHabitat for Humanity is a global nonprofit housing organization working in local communities across all 50 states in the U.S. and in approximately 70 countries. Habitat’s vision is of a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Habitat works toward the City’s vision by building strength, stability, and self-reliance in partnership with families in need of decent and affordable housing. Habitat homeowners help build their own homes alongside volunteers and pay an affordable mortgage.\n \nHabitat has a well planned construction schedule that must take into account timing of public and private funding availability, volunteer labor, and subcontractor schedules.  Habitat for Humanity is the only developer building homeownership units with HOME funds for qualified homebuyers who earn between 30-60 % AMI and every home on the list is one purchased or optioned from/with the Land Bank of Columbus and Franklin County. \n \nHabitat offers a zero percent interest mortgage and also brings up to 58% of the funding to each deal with the use of donor dollars, the mortgage payments of other Habitat homeowners, and in-kind donations for materials.  These six units are part of the eleven in Columbus that Habitat plans to build in the 2023-2024 construction season and funded, in part, with City of Columbus HOME funds:  \n \n1362 Aberdeen Avenue (010 059520) (HOME 2022) - A two adult, two children partner family has selected this lot to build their two-story, four-bedroom home.  \n \n1501 Genessee Avenue (010-059900) (HOME 2023) - A two-parent, two children family has selected this lot to build their two-story, four-bedroom home.     \n \n1910 Genessee Avenue (010-069458) (HOME 2023) - A partner family consisting of one head of household, two adults, and 2 children family has selected this lot to build their two-story, five-bedroom home.      \n \n1936 Genessee Avenue (010-069430) (HOME 2023) - A single adult, one child family has selected this lot to build their two-story, three-bedroom home.\n \n1315 Minnesota (010-059110) (HOME 2023) - A two-parent, three children family has selected this lot to build their two-story, four-bedroom home.      \n \n1330 Minnesota (010-059280) (HOME 2023) - A single adult, two children family has selected this lot to build their two-story, three-bedroom home.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2022 Annual Action Plan per ordinance 2800-2021 and the 2023 Annual Action Plan per ordinance 3353-2022.\n \nEmergency action is requested as the need for housing in the community is great and we are vastly approaching the fall and winter months where construction of these units will be impacted by the elements.  The sooner the construction is able to start on these projects the better as the elements will impact the ability of the units to be finished which further add a strain to our already existing housing crisis as such immediate action is necessary. \n \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 004859 and expires 3/20/2025.\n \nFiscal Impact: $100,000.00 is available from the 2022 HOME grant (G442102) and $500,000.00 is available from the 2023 HOME grant (442202).  The commitment of funds through this legislation is conditioned on compliance with HUD’s environmental review requirements. The funding from HOME Fund (2201) is only authorized if all HOME review and comment requirements have been met prior to any commitment of funds, as approved by the Responsible Entity Agency Official. An Authorization to Utilize Grant Funds will be received by the City from HUD in advance of the execution of documents for this project.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize appropriation and expenditure of up to $600,000.00 of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grants ($100,000.00 from the 2022 grant and $500,000.00 from the 2023 grant) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, and restrictive convent with Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio to construct six single family homes with each address having its own set of loan documents; and to declare an emergency.
