    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation, a non-profit corporation, to act as fiscal agent in support of Our Brothers Keepers.\n \nIn 2022, Our Brothers Keepers began the process of organizing as a non-profit organization, focusing on providing assistance, employment, and temporary shelter for homeless teens. During the summer of 2023, Our Brothers Keepers was able to hire 30 teens (with 40 more on a wait list) paying $15 per hour to perform lawn care and landscaping throughout Columbus. Our Brothers Keepers also provides educational workshops and field trips for students, including basic car mechanics, general construction, printing t-shirts, field trips to Facebook headquarters in Central Ohio, and financial responsibility.\n \nThe organization is currently restricted on the number of teens that can be served because of transportation limitations. This funding will be utilized to purchase two used 15-passenger vans.\n \nWhile Our Brothers Keepers is registered as a non-profit organization with the State of Ohio, the organization does not yet have 501(c)3 status with the IRS. Therefore, Columbus Next Generation Corporation will serve as fiscal agent to administer the grant agreement with the City of Columbus.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation to act as fiscal agent in support of Our Brothers Keepers; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.
