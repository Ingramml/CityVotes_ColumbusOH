    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the transfer of $500,000.00 from the Department of Finance's City-wide account to the Department of Public Safety for the purposes of continuing the Business District Safety Enhancement Program. Through this program, the Department of Public Safety works in conjunction with the Division of Police and neighborhood business groups such as the Short North Alliance and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District to develop plans to appropriately deter crime and improve safety in Columbus’ business districts. Both the Short North Alliance and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District are not-for-profit entities.\n \nFollowing the Covid-19 pandemic, the City of Columbus experienced a significant up-tick in violent crime throughout the community, notably in densely populated and visited business districts. In 2022 the City of Columbus funded the Business District Safety Enhancement Program which resulted in a significant reduction of crime. There is a need for a continuation of this funding from the City of Columbus to supplement safety enhancements in business districts throughout the City of Columbus. These organizations will utilize this funding in support of their violent crime interdiction programs, which utilize law enforcement personnel serving in a special duty capacity, educational campaigns, and community outreach workers in an effort to prevent and address violent crime in their respective districts.\n \nThis neighborhood safety program is part of a much larger community investment strategy employed by the City to provide safe and resilient communities. The City of Columbus has utilized a community wide approach under a number of assistance programs including summer youth safety programming in the amount of 16 million in 2022 as well as numerous Neighborhood Safety Grants. \n \nShort North Alliance, FID: xx-xxxxxxx, CC# CC-008394 \nCapital Crossroads Special Improvement District, FID: xx-xxxxxxx, CC# CC-006946\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that the necessary funds can be provided to the Short North Alliance and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District so that immediate steps can be taken to make safety enhancements in the business districts and the surrounding community since all existing funding has been disbursed and the requested funding will allow continuation of the Safety Enhancement Programs. \n \nFiscal Impact: Ordinance 0587-2023, passed 5/15/23, authorized the distribution of $500,000.00 to organizations responsible for maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of residents and visitors in Columbus' business districts, including $250,000.00 each to the Short North Alliance and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District for the period from January to August 2023.  This legislation authorizes new grant agreements for the period from August 2023 to March 2024, providing an additional $250,000.00 to each organization in order to continue supporting their violent crime interdiction programming.  This amount is budgeted and available within the Department of Finance's General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into grant agreements with the Short North Alliance and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District for the purposes of administering the Business District Safety Enhancements Program; to authorize the transfer of $500,000.00 within the General Fund, from the Department of Finance to the Department of Public Safety; to authorize the expenditure of $500,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
