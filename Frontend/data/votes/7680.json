    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: The Civil Service Commission needs to modify Attachment A of the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. to reflect updated medical exam components and per component pricing for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police Academy classes to only those required by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine - Law Enforcement Officers (ACOEM/LEO). No additional funding beyond the $310,000.00 already appropriated and encumbered for these services will be required at this time with the passage of this modification ($0.00)\n \nFollowing a review of current medical testing requested by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to be performed on Police Officer candidates, and in consultation with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., it was determined that current CSC requirements now exceed those recommended by the ACOEM/LEO.  As such, to ensure the City’s medical testing does not subject candidates to assessments or standards greater than those recommended and typically used by jurisdictions throughout the country, the CSC is requesting authority to modify its current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. to change its current medical test components to only those recommended by the ACOEM/LEO.  In addition to aligning, identically, with ACOEM/LEO standards, all medical testing and associated results required by the Ohio Revised Code (ORC.) 742.38 and Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 742-1-02 for submission to the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund will be met.\n \nBID INFORMATION: In 2022, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ 023538) for these services and accepted proposals through December 2, 2022. Three proposals were submitted by the deadline.  An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFQ and the Executive Director selected and executed a contract with the selected vendor, Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., via Ordinance 3084-2022.  \n \nBecause this modification request, if passed, will actually reduce per candidate medical testing costs, there would be no overall benefit to the City to rebid the services contract since Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. was the best and most responsive bidder of the original three respondents.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency legislation is requested in order to allow for implementation of the revised testing and reduced testing costs for candidates from the newest Police Officer eligible list to be scheduled for medical testing on or after October 9, 2023, ensuring fair and equal treatment of all candidates coming from the same eligible list.\n \nContract Compliance Number: CC005227, expires 09/21/2025. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these anticipated services, to date, was budgeted and previously appropriated and encumbered via ACPO008496/PO369101 ($40K), ACPO009189/PO387289 ($200K), and ACPO009427/PO407950 ($70K) from the Civil Service Commission’s General Fund budget, and per candidate costs will actually be reduced with the passage and implementation of this modification. \n                     \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify Attachment A of the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. to reflect medical exam components and per component pricing for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; and to declare an emergency ($0.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the contract to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. based upon the submissions of RFQ 023538; and\n \nWHEREAS, budgeted and previously appropriated and encumbered funding via ACPO008496/PO369101 ($40K), ACPO009189/PO387289 ($200K), and ACPO009427/PO407950 ($70K) from the Civil Service Commission’s General Fund budget is available for use for these services; and\n \nWHEREAS it is now necessary to modify Attachment A of the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. to reflect medical exam components and per component pricing for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police Academy classes to only those required by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine - Law Enforcement Officers (ACOEM/LEO); and\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to allow for implementation of the revised testing and reduced testing costs for candidates from the newest Police Officer eligible list to be scheduled for medical testing on or after October 9, 2023, ensuring fair and equal treatment of all candidates coming from the same eligible list, and thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare; now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to modify Attachment A of the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. to reflect medical exam components and per component pricing for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police Academy classes to only those required by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine - Law Enforcement Officers (ACOEM/LEO).\n \nSECTION 2. That no additional expenditure of funds, other than those previously appropriated and encumbered via ACPO008496/PO369101 ($40K), ACPO009189/PO387289 ($200K), and ACPO009427/PO407950 ($70K) from the Civil Service Commission’s General Fund budget, will be needed at this time as a result of this modification.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
