    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into contract to purchase one (1) 2024 Ford Transit bus from Byers Chevrolet, LLC.

Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet may ensure the pending purchase and delivery of these vehicles, which will not occur without this additional funding. \n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to enter into contract for the purchase of one (1) 2024 Ford Transit bus from Byers Chevrolet, LLC.; to authorize the expenditure of $52,297.00 from the Fleet General Obligation Debt Fund; and to declare an emergency.
