    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to appropriate and expend funds with Neverman Construction in order to repair damage to 1402-1418 Cleveland Avenue due to a hit and run incident in which a vehicle collided with the building causing damage to the building exterior, its structure, and the interior retail space of the City’s Tenant, Subway.  Per the terms of the lease between the City and Cleveland Ave Subs, LLC (Subway), any non-structural repairs are the responsibility of Subway and its insurance carrier, Liberty Mutual, and any structural repairs are the responsibility of the City. Upon Subway obtaining a formal estimate to repair the damage to its leased space, a portion of the repair was determined to be structural and therefore the responsibility of the City to repair. The construction repair contract will be between Neverman Construction  and Liberty Mutual with the City agreeing to pay for the structural portion of the total cost to repair along with a portion of the construction permit fee and ROW permit fee with Neverman separately invoicing the City for its portion of the repairs; and to declare an emergency. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $8,000, or as much as may be needed, as the City’s portion of the expense to repair building damage at 1402-1418 Cleveland Avenue.  Funds are available within the Property Management 1402-1418 Cleveland Fund 2294, Subfund 229408 ($8,000.00). \n \nNeverman Construction  is a registered vendor, Contract Compliance Number 005887, expiration 1/19/24.\n \nEmergency Justification: This ordinance is presented as an emergency to enable the repair to the structural building damage at 1402-1418 Cleveland Avenue to begin at the earliest time possible in order to restore the building and minimize further disruption to Subway’s business.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to appropriate and expend funds with Neverman Construction for building damage repair to 1402-1418 Cleveland Avenue; and to declare an emergency.
