A portion of the funding will be used for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages expenses to support participants of the event. It is estimated that less than $1,200.00 will be used for food and non-alcoholic beverage costs.\n \nInternational Day of the Girl was created to increase attention on issues that matter to girls amongst governments, policymakers and the general public, and more opportunities for girls to have their voices heard on the global stage.\n \nColumbus City Council will engage with students of Columbus City Prep School For Girls to empower and inform girls on gender inequalities, its impact and to have a platform to share their lived experiences and inequalities that impacts their girlhood with policymakers.\n \nImage Character Etiquette (ICE) is a mentoring and empowerment organization created to provide youth with practical lessons and positive examples of how to navigate life. Through personal interactions with program mentors and real-world examples, we teach youth not only how to go through life, but how to live meaningful lives fueled by purpose and propelled by passion. \n \nEryn PiNK Girl Empowerment is a program under ICE Mentors created to specifically serve girls. The mission of Eryn PiNK is to challenge the narrative of what it means to be a girl in today’s society, by inspiring girls to set standards and expectations that align with their values and morals, to encourage confidence so that they can confront stereotypes and peer pressure, and to empower them to find their purpose and use their voice.\n \nCity Code Section 329.35 permits the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages for a valid public purpose and permits the use of funds for community programs and events sponsored by the City.  The expenditure of public funds will be an integral part of the International Day of the Girl Summit.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to provide upfront funding to pay for services in anticipation of the October 11, 2023 event.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Image Character Etiquette Inc. in support of the International Day of The Girl Summit event; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure  within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
