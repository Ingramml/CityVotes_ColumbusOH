    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Arcadis U.S., Inc. to provide professional design services associated with the Big Walnut Trail, Little Turtle to Cherrybottom Park. Alum Creek Trail Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $1,800,972.12.\n \nOrdinance 0654-2022 authorized the Director of Recreation and Park to enter into contract with Arcadis U.S., Inc. to do a preliminary alignment study to extend the Big Walnut Trail from Little Turtle to Sunbury Road. The study included public involvement, analysis of potential trail corridors, and preliminary cost estimating. It also coordinated key regional trail building agencies within the local area and a phase one inventory of environmental resources. The results produced a preferred alignment for the Recreation and Parks Department to advance into this intended Stage Two modification for detailed design. The contract modification for Stage Two was planned in 2022 so that engineering could continue once the preferred alignment was determined. Procurement of a separate consultant contract would cost the city additional funds, delays in the project schedule, and would not provide the Department with the cost estimating necessary to apply for grant funding. The project is scheduled to begin construction in the summer of 2025. \n \nIn June of 2021, the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) approved federal grant funding for the Recreation and Parks Department towards the construction of this 2.5 mile section of trail. This connection will go from the Little Turtle neighborhood to Sunbury Road, Cherrybottom Park, and the Alum Creek Trail. As part of the grant funding, the Recreation and Parks Department is obligated to perform the design of the project.  \n \nThe MORPC grant provides $5.6 million towards building this significant trail infrastructure for the city’s Northeast communities, including an underpass beneath State Route 161. This new infrastructure will create a direct connection to Blendon Woods Metro Park, a stream crossing to connect Northland neighborhoods on the west side of the river, and a section of trail along Sunbury Road linking to the Alum Creek Trail. Over 15,000 Columbus residents live in neighborhoods served by this new trail section. Once completed, the trail will connect residents to retail, health care, attractions, and over 40,000 jobs at major destinations including Easton and the North Hamilton Road mixed use corridor.   \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nArcadis U.S., Inc.\n7575 Huntington Park Drive, Suite 130\nColumbus, Ohio 43235\nJay Muether, (614) 985-9205\nContract Compliance Number: 009409\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: February 22, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as the MORPC grant funding schedule for this project requires that the consultant be engaged in Stage 2 Final Design Plans by October 16, 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Access to trails and key destinations is one of the top rated priorities noted by Columbus residents.  The Northeast communities have no regional trail access and this project will provide significant connectivity for over 15,000 residents. It will connect to major employment centers with an estimated 40,000 jobs, 6 parks, and over 24 miles of the existing Alum Creek Trail. Completing this project provides the critical central core of trail infrastructure to build new extensions to Hoover Reservoir, Rocky Fork, Northland, as well as local path connections along the city’s current roadway improvement projects. There are regional linkage plans which connect this project to the surrounding cities of Westerville, Gahanna, and New Albany. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Recreation and Parks has received letters of support from the community, Central Ohio Greenways, civic associations, Northland Area Coalition, and trail users citywide. During this phase, extensive public outreach will be conducted by a project website, stakeholder meetings, public open house, and community survey.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Rocky Fork-Blacklick (33), Northland (35)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving equitable access to trails and greenways corridors. It will provide safe east-west connections to the regional trail network for nearby neighborhoods.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $444,061.75 was legislated for the Big Walnut Trail, Little Turtle to Cherry Bottom Park, Alum Creek Trail Project by Ordinance 0654-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $1,800,972.12. $1,800,972.12 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $2,245,033.87.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Arcadis U.S., Inc. for the Big Walnut Trail - Little Turtle to Cherrybottom Park - Alum Creek Trail Project; to authorize the transfer of $1,800,972.12 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $1,800,972.12 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
