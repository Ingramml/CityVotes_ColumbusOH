    "description": "Explanation \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and to accept funding from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to support work performed as part of the FRA-Columbus-PSIP-FY2021 PID 113293 project, also known as the Pedestrian Safety Improvement Program. \nThe aforementioned project consists of pedestrian safety improvements at various locations within the City of Columbus culminating in the reconstruction of designated intersections, including striping crosswalks, installing pedestrian signal infrastructures, reconstructing curb ramps, and constructing new curb extensions, curb ramps and median refuge islands.  While the following list is subject to change, the designated intersections to be improved include:\n•                     Grant Avenue and Walnut Street\n•                     Livingston Avenue and 22nd Avenue\n•                     Livingston Avenue and Wilson Avenue\n•                     Livingston Avenue and Lilley Avenue\n•                     Livingston Avenue and Bulen Avenue\n•                     Livingston Avenue And Hampton Road\n•                     Livingston Avenue And Coburg Road\n•                     Livingston Avenue And Elderwood Avenue\n•                     Neil Avenue and Collins Avenue\n•                     4th Street and Detroit / 4th Avenue Midblock\n•                     4th Street and 3rd Avenue\n•                     4th Street and 4th Avenue\n•                     4th Street and 13th Avenue\n•                     Lane Avenue between Neil Street and High Street\n•                     Lane Avenue and Waldeck Avenue\n•                     Kinnear Road and OSU Research Center\n•                     Kinnear Road and Graybar Electric Supply\n•                     Harper Road and McKinley Avenue\n•                     Ohio Avenue and Mound Street\n \nOriginally, ODOT was to administer construction of the project, and Ordinance 2129-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with ODOT relative to that effort.  ODOT recently asked the Department of Public Service to oversee the construction of the planned improvements and awarded the City up to $1,737,687.00 for that purpose.  ODOT will pay 100% of the cost of the improvements, with the City assuming responsibility for any enhancements beyond what ODOT considers necessary for the project.  A separate ordinance will be presented to Council for  consideration to authorize the award of the construction contract and the expenditure of funds to build the improvements. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNone at this time; a separate ordinance authorizing the expenditure of funds to support anticipated construction costs will be submitted to City Council at a later date. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of requisite agreements and the receipt and acceptance of requisite construction funding as soon as reasonably practicable to prevent delays in the construction of these public safety enhancements.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with, and accept funding from, the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the FRA-Columbus-PSIP-FY2021 PID 113293 project;

and    \n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 2129-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with ODOT relative to that effort; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT recently asked the Department of Public Service to oversee the aforementioned project and awarded the City up to $1,737,687.00 for that purpose;
