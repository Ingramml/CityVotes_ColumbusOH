    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Arcadis US, Inc for the PAWP Wellfield Development project, CIP #690580-100000, in an amount up to $1,902,000.00.\n \nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP) is a critical component in the City’s potable water supply system. The PAWP currently has 6 collector wells.  This project provides engineering design and construction improvements for the 7th radial collector well as an additional raw water source for the PAWP. This project is part of the City’s ongoing program to upgrade its treatment facilities to provide safe, efficient, reliable, cost-effective operations for its approximately 1.2 million customers.\nThe work performed to date included Preliminary Design Services for the proposed collector well (CW112).  \nThe work to be performed during this contract modification includes designing and preparing detailed plans and specifications for the collector well and associated raw waterline recommended under the preliminary design phase.  This includes approval of all permits, conducting design review meetings, providing construction cost estimates, developing construction schedules, assistance with bidding and review of bids received, and other detailed design service.\n \nFuture contract modifications are anticipated to provide Engineering Services During Construction as this is a multi-year project.\n \nThe Parsons Avenue Water Plant project is in the planning area 99 - Citywide.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE:  \nThe original agreement allowed for a total term of 5 years.\nPhase 1:  (Preliminary Design) March 2022 to June 2023. \nPhase 2:  (Detailed Design) to begin August 2023 and end August 2024.\nPhase 3:  (Engineering Services During Construction) to begin 3rd quarter 2024 and completed in the 4th quarter of 2027.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,902,000.00\nThe original contract amount was $1,534,500.00.  This modification is for $1,902,000.00.  There is an anticipated additional modification of $1,250,000.00 for a total project estimated cost of $4,686,500.00.\n \nCost summary: \n \nPreliminary Design (PO316092, Ordinance 0176-2022)  $1,534,500.00\nDetailed Design                                        Current)       $1,902,000.00  \nEngineering Services During Construction (Future)         $1,250,000.00 (Estimate) \nESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                           $4,686,500.00 (Estimate)\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original professional services agreement was bid out and planned for a total of two contract modifications. This is the first modification.  Also, the current consultant is familiar with the project and has completed all the preliminary design work to date.  Bidding the work to another consultant will delay the project and will result in higher costs due to bringing the new consultant up to speed on the project and delay the timeline for construction of the collector well.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the detail design modification and pricing provided under the original contract.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved these cost summaries.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project will partially offset future anticipated loss of existing wells and/or well capacity at the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP).  Having an adequate supply of water is important for the City growth and economic development.  \n \nThis work will occur within the city’s property south of the plant PAWP and will not be accessible to the public, so public meetings are not anticipated\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nArcadis US, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006409 and expires 2/22/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis US, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Arcadis US, Inc. is classified as a MAJ company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Arcadis US, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants, two of which are MBE/WBE’s.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is anticipated to be approximately $203,000.00, or 10.7% of the contract modification amount.                     \n                                          \nAs part of their proposal, Arcadis US, Inc has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nEagon and Associates                                                                    Worthington, Ohio                                                                              MAJ\nColdwater                                                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nMoody Engineering, LLC                                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\n \nThe certification of Arcadis US, Inc and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
