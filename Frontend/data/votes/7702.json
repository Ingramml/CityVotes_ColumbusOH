    "description": "Explanation\n \nColumbus and Central Ohio are growing.  The City and its partners are working to embrace the opportunities of growth, while also addressing the challenges it brings.  Zoning is one of the most effective tools cities can use to manage change.  A 2021 assessment found that the current Columbus zoning code does not support our community’s aspiration to be an equitable thriving city.  In response, the City has embarked on the Zone In initiative - the first comprehensive update of its zoning code in 70 years.  \n \nThe size and complexity of this task requires a phased approach.  Public input, policy and analysis all point to corridors as the best place to start.  Our “Main Streets” have the greatest capacity to deliver the housing, mobility and employment opportunities our community needs in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable.  Technical work and public engagement are well underway to bring updated zoning to 143 miles of transportation corridors identified for this first phase.  Later phases of Zone In will focus on neighborhoods and other portions of the City.  \n \nThis resolution reinforces five overall project goals and sets forth five priorities (see attached) to guide the first phase work as Zone In moves from a broader conversation to specific recommendations for updated, mixed-use zoning.  These priorities draw on thousands of points of engagement, extensive technical analysis, adopted land use and larger efforts such as the Columbus Housing Strategy, LinkUS and the Climate Action Plan.\n \n \nTitle\nTo Adopt and Support the Zone In Project Goals and Phase One Priorities \nBody\nWHEREAS, Columbus is undertaking Zone In, the first comprehensive zoning code update in 70 years, the first phase of which focuses on key corridors; and\n \nWEHREAS, Zone In is guided by five project goals outlining a modern zoning code that promotes a sustainable, equitable city as well as the following phase one priorities; and \n \nWHEREAS, a priority is to leverage corridors to create more housing in more places to help address the City’s and region’s housing shortage, by supporting changes that make it easier and more likely to build more housing as the current zoning code does not support housing creation; and\n \nWHEREAS, a priority is to support “Main Street” jobs and businesses with opportunities to grow their customer base nearby and greater flexibility to adapt to changing market dynamics as the current zoning code does not support local business; and\n \nWHEREAS, a priority is to promote equitable development with a code that relies on clear, objective standards and is easier to navigate as the current zoning code does not support equity; and\n \nWHEREAS, a priority is to expand the role of corridors in creating healthy, connected communities by reinforcing land use patterns that support alternatives to using a car and provide better access to jobs, education, healthcare and housing as the current zoning code does not support transit, walking and biking; and\n \nWHEREAS, a priority is to foster good urban design and appealing “Main Streets” to support investment in communities and ensure high quality of life for residents as the current zoning code does not support quality design; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Zone In project goals and phase one priorities draw on thousands of points of engagement, extensive technical analysis, adopted land use and community plans, as well as larger efforts such as the Columbus Housing Strategy, LinkUS and the Climate Action Plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, these goals and priorities were presented at a City Council public hearing held on August 21, 2023; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council adopts and supports the Zone In project goals and phase one priorities and that the Zone In project team is directed to apply these goals and priorities in the development of recommendations for updated zoning during phase one of the effort.",
