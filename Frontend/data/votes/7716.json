    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects to add additional funds for the design of the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project.  This modification is to design Blossom Field Boulevard from Broad Street to Westbourne Avenue.\nOrdinance No. 1934-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a $500,000.00 professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects for the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project.  This Phase 1 project consists of constructing, resurfacing, widening, new curb and gutter, sidewalks, drives, storm sewer system, and a shared use path on Westbourne Avenue from approximately 600 feet west of Taylor Station Road to Blossom Field Boulevard. This project will also include a roundabout and new alignment on Corrina Drive south of the roundabout.                     \n \nOrdinance 0438-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $675,000.00 to cover Phase 1 of the design.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract again in the amount of $300,000.00.\n \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to cover Phase 2 of the design now known as the Roadway - Blossom Field Boulevard - Broad Street to Westbourne Avenue project.  This project creates a new public street where a private street (Blossom Field Boulevard) exists from E. Broad Street to approximately 1,800 feet north of E. Broad Street. The project also serves as Phase 2 of the Roadway - Westbourne Avenue Extension project by extending from its Phase 1 terminus to Blossom Field Boulevard. Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects performed the study work for the entire corridor and the survey work for Phase 2 detailed design.   \n \nGannett Fleming Engineers & Architects provided a cost breakdown for each task included in the scope. After several negotiations, the final fee was determined to be in line with what is expected for the scope of work and design timeline. Costs were also compared to other recent design projects of similar scope and magnitude.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this modification of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00                          (PO241932, Ord. 1934-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $675,000.00                          (PO315613, Ord. 0438-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                                    $300,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                                $1,475,000.00  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects is CC001829 and expires 01/11/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 4432 (Lucent Commercial TIF).  Funds will need to be appropriated in Fund 4432, transferred to Fund 7432 (Lucent Commercial TIF Capital Fund), and then appropriated in Fund 7432.  Project expenses will be paid from Fund 7432.\n \n4.
