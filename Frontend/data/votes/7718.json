    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with The Righter Co., Inc. for the Raymond and Wilson Bridge Improvements 2023 Project. The contract amount is $475,675.00, with a contingency of $47,567.00, for a total of $523,242.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $525,242.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nAt the end of 2021, the Recreation and Parks Department completed bridge inspections for all of the Department's inventory to identify bridges in need of maintenance and structural repairs. Based on these inspection reports and input from Golf Section staff, the bridges at Raymond Memorial Golf Course were identified as needing work beyond routine maintenance. The current conditions impact course play. The conditions also inhibit emergency vehicles or heavier equipment from accessing areas of the course. Emergency vehicles must currently utilize main roads to access areas of the course, because of the bridge conditions, and this adds onto the overall response time to some areas of the golf course. \n \nThis project will make the necessary repairs to pedestrian and golf cart bridges to ensure consistent aesthetics and more efficient usage of cart rentals. Most importantly, it will provide safe and accessible bridges. This project will begin in the fall of 2023 and should be complete by spring of 2024. This timing is needed to minimize impacts to the general public and course operations.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on July 25, 2023, and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 15, 2023.
