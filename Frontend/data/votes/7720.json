    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Berglund Construction Company for the Mentel Golf Clubhouse Exterior Improvements Project. The contract amount is $248,000.00, with a contingency of $77,000.00, for a total of $325,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nMentel Memorial Golf Course is a highly utilized recreational asset for the city which had over 38,000 rounds of golf played in 2022. The clubhouse at Mentel Memorial Golf Course was built in 2001 with an exterior consisting primarily of painted stucco and wood trim. The building has suffered deterioration and damage due to weather exposure over the past two decades. This project will rejuvenate the exterior of the facility which will correct structural damage, upgrade lighting to LED light fixtures, and update door hardware for security improvements. Improvements to the clubhouse will continue to provide high quality recreational activities to city residents.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on June 2, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on August 8, 2023.
