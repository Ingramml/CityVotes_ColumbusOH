    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $50,000.00 from the Development - Taxable Bond Fund to cover personnel costs incurred by the Department of Development’s Division of Housing’s inspection of bond eligible projects.  \n \nThe Division of Housing’s Homeowner Services Center has grant programs that assist individuals and families with remaining in their homes and live independently in a safe and sound environment.  Programs include:  Emergency Repair, Roof Replacement, and Critical Home Repair.  These programs are currently bond funded or had been bond funded in the past but are now funded with Community Development Block Grant funds.  Once a project at a home is approved, City staff engage a contractor to do the work, and then City staff inspect the work before deeming the project complete.\n \nDivision staff who inspect the projects are budgeted in the General Fund.  They track their time inspecting bond eligible projects and each quarter, the department does an expenditure correction to move the inspection expense to bond funds.  In years past, the expense was charged to a blanket Auditor’s Certificate Purchase Order (ACPO).  Beginning this year, the department desires to establish a dedicated Auditor’s Certificate Direct Invoice (ACDI) for this expense.  New ACDI’s will be established in future years as needed.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to move expenses timely and maintain an accurate General Fund budget.\n \nFiscal Impact:  $50,000.00 is available in the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget, Development Taxable bond fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation of $50,000.00 from Development Taxable Bond Fund to cover personnel costs incurred by the Department of Development’s Division of Housing’s inspection of bond eligible projects; and to declare an emergency.  ($50,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development’s Division of Housing’s Homeowner Services Center has grant programs that assist individuals and families with remaining in their homes and live independently in a safe and sound environment.  Programs include:  Emergency Repair, Roof Replacement, and Critical Home Repair; and\n \nWHEREAS, once a project at a home is approved, City staff engage a contractor to do the work, and then City staff inspect the work before deeming the project complete; and\n \nWHEREAS, City staff track their time inspecting bond eligible projects and each quarter, the Department of Development does an expenditure correction to move the inspection expense to bond funds;\n \nWHEREAS, it is desired that the City Auditor set up an Auditor’s Certificate Direct Invoice (ACDI) dedicated to this expense for easier accounting; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer and expend funds for this expense from Development Taxable Bond Fund 7739.\n \nWhereas, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary in order to move expenses timely and maintain an accurate General Fund budget., thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget authorized by ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient authority for this project:\n                                       \nFund / Project / Project Name / C.I.B. / Change / C.I.B. as Amended\n \n7739 / P782001-100000 / Housing Preservation (Unvoted Carryover) / $735,014.00 / ($50,000.00) / $685,014.00\n7739 / P782033-100000 / Homeowner Services Inspection (Unvoted Carryover) / $0.00 / $50,000.00 / $50,000.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That the transfer of $50,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within Fund 7739 (Development - Taxable), from Dept-Div 4410 (Housing)  P782001-100000 to P782033-100000 per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.
