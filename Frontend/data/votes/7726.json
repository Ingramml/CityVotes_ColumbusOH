    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design to extend the agreement term to April 30, 2024, in order to complete the work and expend all of the funds encumbered.\n                     \n                       Original $125,000.00                      Ordinance 0231-2023                      PO385133\n                                           Mod 1 $0.00\n                           Total $125,000.00\n \nAs Columbus continues to grow, there are real concerns that housing affordability and supply issues will continue to worsen. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) provide an opportunity to increase the housing supply, provide financial stability for owners, and can be leveraged to increase affordable housing. ADUs have the opportunity to positively impact a number of Columbus residents, including aging residents looking to downsize but stay in their neighborhood; retirees on fixed incomes needing extra income to cover their mortgage; homeowners looking for real estate investments; young professionals without families; and people with disabilities that can have their own living space but still be close to family support. The overall economic impact of ADUs is that they will increase the supply of studio and one-bedroom options in Columbus. \nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to extend the current contract which expires October 31, 2023, and ensure that Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design can continue work without interruption providing design services in aid of the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program.\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is necessary.\nContract Compliance: the vendor number is 005667 and expires 03/28/2025\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design to extend the term of the agreement to April 30, 2024, in order to complete the work and expend all of the funds encumbered; and to declare an emergency ($0.00).\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development executed an agreement with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design to provide design services in aid of the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program; and \nWHEREAS, the agreement term needs to be extended in order to complete the work and expend the remaining funding; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design to extend the current contract which expires October 31, 2023, and continue providing the architectural design services that will be used to aid in the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program; now, therefore,\n \n                     BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design to extend the agreement term to April 30, 2024, in order to complete the work and expend all of the funds encumbered.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
