    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with HDS Companies LLC (HDS) in an amount up to $596,110.00 of federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA2) funds to provide software to administer the federally funded Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program and to allow for payment of services. \n \nOrdinance 3393-2022 authorized the Director of Development to enter into a contract with HDS in an amount of up to $239,228.00 of federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds to provide software to administer the federally funded Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program and to allow for payment of services. The City has a need to continue utilizing this software including renewing the system license, maintenance, technical support, professional services, software hosting, storage of data, reporting and training for the continued operation of the ERA program. \n \nHDS’ software, Allita 360, is a fully web and end-to-end digital solution. This system supports intake and processing of applications for rent and utility assistance. The system supports separate portals for tenants, property managers/landlords, agencies, and community. The system is ADA compliant and supports multi-language applications. This software moves applications quickly through the process of approval and meets eligibility requirements. The system provides consistency among agency partners and flexibility to fund applications efficiently. \n \nThe software has been in use since the city started distributing ERA funds, early in the COVID-19 pandemic.  Up until now, HDS has had individual contracts with the city’s non-profit partners and each organization paid for a portion of the software.  That type of contract management has proved to be challenging and threatened to hold up use of the system by all if an organization did not make payment.  Moving the contract to the city, with the city funding it, provides security and continues the efficiency and ease of use already established for the remainder of the program.  Program/grant closeout will occur in FY 2023 and records need to be maintained for five years after grant closeout.\n \nSole Source Request:  Under the authority of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.19(e), the Director of the Department of Development is requesting that this be considered a Sole Source Procurement because the software is only available from HDS and it would be prohibitive to do a competitive procurement effort to change software while nearing the end of the federal program. The current software houses all data and reporting needs for closing out the program and for record retention.  Federal regulations (2 CFR 200.320(c)(2) authorizes a non-competitive procurement if the item is available only from a single source.  See attached sole source document.\n \nEmergency action is necessary in order to resolve immediate needs for eviction prevention and to assure that the system is available for the intake and processing of applications for assistance.  Prompt payment is needed to provide continued access by all users and maintain the access to the data for federal reporting and record retention purposes.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $596,110.00 is available in the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund (Fund 2208).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 044403 and expires on 2/16/2025.  \n  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with HDS Companies LLC in an amount up to $596,110.00 to provide Allita 360 software for the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program in accordance with the sole source provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $596,110.00 from the ERA2 fund; and to declare an emergency. ($596,110.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the city and its partners needing a software solution to administer the city’s and Franklin County’s federal Emergency Rental Assistance funds received as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;                      and\n \nWHEREAS, the city and its partners selected the Allita 360 software system and individual organizations paid a portion of the costs for access to the software; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the city and its partners to allow the for the city to enter into a contract, with HDS Companies LLC (HDA) as a sole source provider, to access to Allita 360 for the remainder of the federal grant program and for the duration of record retention because the software is only available from this vendor; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with the HDS Companies LLC to resolve immediate needs for eviction prevention and to assure that the system is available for the intake and processing of applications for assistance.  Prompt payment is needed to provide continued access by all users, and maintain the access to the data for federal reporting and record retention purposes, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, safety, property, and welfare; now, therefore\n                      \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to enter into a contract with HDS Companies LLC (HDS) in an amount up to $596,110.00 to provide software to administer the federally funded Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program and to pay for expenses incurred before the purchase order is approved by the city in accordance with the sole source provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.19(e).\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purpose stated in Section 2, the expenditure of $596,110.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 2208 (ERA2), Dept-Div 44-01 (Administration Development), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes it.",
