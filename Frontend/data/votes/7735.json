($25,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Director of Human Resources seeks the authority to modify and increase the contract currently in effect with Safex, Inc. for occupational safety and health and industrial hygiene related activities.  The City entered into the original contract effective March 1, 2020 (Ord. 0266-2020), and renewed the contract earlier this year (Ord. 0112-2023). \n \nThe Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC) encourages employers to enhance occupational safety and health programs and initiatives. The initial legislation as well as this ordinance enables the city to do so and reflect the City’s ongoing effort to promote workplace safety and efficient claims management. This contract allows the city to provide industrial hygiene and occupational safety services, as required by state and federal law. Continuing the existing contractual relationship with Safex Inc. enables the administration to achieve its objective of improving the level of workplace safety and decreasing the risk of exposure to injury. This female owned business has helped the city in all aspects of industrial hygiene and occupational safety tasks in an efficient and cost effective manner.\n \nCosts initially legislated, per Ordinance 0112-2023, totaled $100,000.00.  This modification provides for an additional $25,000.00 for expenses related specifically to hazardous waste training, quantitative exposure assessments, and evaluation of city buildings and work place settings for bio-hazard concerns.  At the time the original contract was legislated, the Occupational Safety team had a full slate of projects to complete in 2023 and was unaware that hazardous waste mitigation and related projects would be needed in several City buildings in 2023. The cost of the projects being completed using these funds was determined based on the rate currently effective in the original contract.\n \nThis legislation serves to increase the maximum obligation liability by $25,000.00, bringing the total contract obligation to $125,000.00, and authorizes the expenditure of the additional $25,000.00.\n \nIt would not be in the City’s best interests to have additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code because Safex, Inc. won the industrial hygiene 2019 RFP and has contract with the City since 2004 on such matters, thus bringing a wealth of institutional knowledge and experience. \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Sufficient funds are available and budgeted in the Employee Benefits Fund for this purpose. \nEmergency Action:  Emergency action is being requested to allow Safex to begin assessment and training for hazardous waste mitigation in City buildings immediately.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Human Resources to modify and increase the existing contract with Safex, Inc., to provide industrial hygiene services and occupational safety program assistance; to authorize the expenditure of $25,000.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay the costs of said contract modification; and to declare an emergency. ($25,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Safex, Inc. was originally engaged to provide industrial hygiene services and occupational safety program assistance and related activities pursuant to Ordinance 0266-2020, adopted by City Council on February 10, 2020, for a contemplated three-year contract and two one-year options to renew; and \n \nWHEREAS, the three-year contract was renewed for an additional year pursuant to Ordinance 0112-2023, and adopted by City Council on February 1, 2023, for a maximum contractual obligation of $100,000.00; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to modify and increase the existing contract with Safex, Inc. to provide sufficient funding for hazardous waste training, quantitative exposure assessments, and evaluation of city buildings and work place settings for biological hazard concerns.  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to an additional $25,000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to pay contract costs; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify and increase the existing contract amount with Safex, Inc. by $25,000.00 to ensure projects related to hazardous waste training, conducting quantitative exposure assessments, and evaluating city buildings and work place settings for biological hazard concerns can begin immediately, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Human Resources is hereby authorized to modify and increase the existing contract with Safex, Inc. by $25,000.00, to ensure all occupational safety and health related programs are funded, specifically those related to hazardous waste training, assessment, and evaluation.  This type of work is accounted for in the original scope of services.\n \nSECTION 2.   That the expenditure of $25,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary is hereby authorized to be expended from the Employee Benefits Fund, fund 5502 in object class 03 Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.                     That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage, if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes \nthe same.",
