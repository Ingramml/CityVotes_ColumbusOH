    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance amends the current authorized strength, as set forth in ordinance 1619-2023.\n \nThe strength levels for most general fund agencies are set to be equal to the 2023 budget as amended by City Council (including the Departments of Health and Recreation and Parks).  Authorized strength levels of smaller non-general fund agencies are set to be equal to the adopted 2023 budget as amended, while the strength levels of certain larger non-general fund agencies may have their strength set slightly higher to allow for flexibility in hiring.  \n \nWithin City Council an increase of nine full-time positions are requested to account for two additional Council members and associated staff. Two positions are requested for the City Attorney’s Office to assist with the Zone initiative.  The Municipal Court Clerk requests to change one part-time position to full time, resulting in no overall change in authorized strength.  The Civil Services Commission requests to increase by one full-time position.  Within the Department of Safety, the Administrative Division requests one additional full-time position in the Human Resources section.  The Department of Public Service requests to increase by three full-time positions in the Administrative Division for various initiatives.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds for these strength levels are budgeted and/or the positions will not be filled until revenues have been clearly identified and appropriated.  In all cases, the ability to hire will be monitored by the Division of Finance and Management.  As such, there is no fiscal impact associated with passage of this ordinance.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the filling of budgeted vacant positions in certain departments in order to provide for the efficient operation of the city that will assure the immediate preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare.\n \nTitle\n \nTo establish a new authorized strength ordinance for various divisions in the City of Columbus; to repeal ordinance 1619-2023; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Mayor's Executive 2023 budget was submitted to City Council on November 10, 2022 for consideration; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council adopted said budget on February 13, 2023; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance repeals authorized strength ordinance 1619-2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to establish a new authorized strength ordinance to provide for the efficient operation of the city that will assure the , and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That pursuant to Section 14 of the City Charter, the maximum number of officers and employees authorized to be employed within the various Departments, Boards and Offices of the City is hereby fixed and established as follows: \n \n-1- Refer to attachment ORD2657-2023currentstrength.xlsx\n-2- Refer to attachment ORD2657-2023previousstrength.xlsx\n \nThe foregoing positions authorized include all positions within each department, division, board, office or commission, whether appointed or elected except the members of any board or commission authorized by charter or ordinance.
