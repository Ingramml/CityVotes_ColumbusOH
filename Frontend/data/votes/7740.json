    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Capital Contribution Agreements with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) in an amount up to $550,000.00 for the property renovation portion of the Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative.\n \nThe Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative (Program) (formally called the Downtown Commercial Marketplace Program) is a small business program that seeks to achieve multiple goals through one comprehensive program. The Program includes:\n \n•                     Providing downtown storefront space for small, local businesses who are oriented towards walk in customers (such as retail or restaurant businesses).\n•                     Providing a master lease holder to: 1) sublease to small, local businesses in a way that promotes their growth and gives them a safe place to land, and 2) rent vacant properties downtown and guarantee stability for the property owners of those spaces.\n•                     Providing technical assistance to the Program participants so that the businesses renting the downtown storefronts can grow and succeed. \n•                     Provide funds for the renovation of properties rented as part of the Program.\n \nThis Program is designed to decrease vacancy downtown; promote small, local businesses; and promote the amenities of downtown as a neighborhood for Columbus residents living and working inside and outside of downtown. \n \nCapital funds in an amount up to $1,000,000.00, approved within the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget, will be used to renovate spaces selected for the Ground Floor Growth Initiative.  This Ordinance represents $500,000.00 of the full commitment. Property owners and program participants will contribute to the planning of and investment in the selected spaces. The City will partner with CDDC to implement part of this Program and this legislation is one of multiple pieces of legislation being put forth for this Program.  The City is also partnering with Columbus Compact Corporation (Ordinance 2044-2023) to identify up to 10 small businesses to participate in the Program and to provide technical assistance to the participants. \n \nUsing bond funds, CDDC will work with the City and Columbus Compact Corporation to identify vacant, ground floor, downtown space that, with assistance from the City and other stakeholders including the property owner and the program participants, can be transformed into a space for selected program participants.  Once a business and space are approved for the Program, CDDC shall submit to the department a cost estimate for the renovation (design and construction costs).  Once a project is approved by the City, funds will be advanced to CDDC to manage the renovation.  With this ordinance, up to $500,000.00 of the $1,000,000.00 commitment is available for renovations costs. The additional $500,000.00 will be legislated at a later date. CDDC will be advanced $50,000.00 for administration services.  Project funds will be advanced on a project by project basis, but the administration funds will be advanced in full.  To further assist local business, CDDC shall publicly procure design and construction services for this Program and shall pay prevailing wage, as applicable under Ohio law.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funding in the amount of $500,000.00 is available in the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Funding in the amount of $50,000.00 is available in the General Fund Job Growth subfund.\n \n \nContract Compliance: the vendor number is 010217 and expires 6/8/2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Capital Contribution Agreements with Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) in an amount up to $550,000.00 for the property renovation portion of the Downtown Ground Floor Growth Initiative; to authorize the advance of funds to CDDC per the agreement schedule; to authorize the modification of Capital Contribution Agreements, up to the amount of funds on the ACPO; to authorize the expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the Taxable Bond Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $50,000.00 from the General Fund Job Growth subfund.
