    "description": "Explanation\nE-bikes are electric bicycles with a motor that gives riders a boost. E-bikes are a low-cost, energy efficient, climate-friendly form of transportation. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and travel up to 28 mph. When you use an e-bike to get around, you can: \n•                     Save thousands of dollars per year on fuel and maintenance by replacing daily car trips with e-bike rides \n•                     Bike greater distances and across harder terrain \n•                     Set aside worries about arriving sweaty at your destination \n•                     Reduce your carbon footprint while running errands or commuting to work\nIn addition to creating low-cost, affordable transportation, e-bikes also provide climate-friendly transportation and will help Columbus reach its Climate Action Plan goals by reducing the carbon footprints in the Columbus community. \nIn July of this year, we launched the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program and provided vouchers for residents who were interested in purchasing an e-bike. Residents applied for the program and once selected to receive a voucher, were able to redeem the voucher at the point of sale and the bike shop would in turn receive that money. This program was wildly successful with over 1300 applicants within 24 hours and nearly 70% of the vouchers have been claimed and redeemed. \nAs a result of this success, this ordinance authorizes additional funding to support the cost of additional vouchers for the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program by entering into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus, LLC, a nonprofit entity, that will issue vouchers for resident purchases of e-bikes in accordance with the Program parameters.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus, LLC in an amount up to $250,000.00 for the Resident E-bike Subsidy program to continue the creation of multimodal transportation options for residents that reduce the carbon footprint in Columbus and supports our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure in the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund; and to declare an emergency.\nBody\nWHEREAS, creating multimodal forms of transportation is paramount; and\nWHEREAS, e-bikes serve as a low-cost, affordable form of transportation; and \nWHEREAS, electric modes of transportation assist in lowering our carbon footprint; and\nWHEREAS, it is the goal of Columbus to be carbon neutral by 2050; and\nWHEREAS, an e-bike subsidy programs helps low-to-moderate income individuals access transportation choices that might be otherwise unavailable; and\nWHEREAS, this program provides vouchers for residents who are interested in purchasing an e-bike. Residents will need to apply for the program and once selected to receive a voucher, they would be able to redeem the voucher at the point of sale and the bike shop would in turn receive that money; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus, LLC in support of the Resident E-bike Subsidy program to avoid delays in continuing the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program following success of the E-bike Incentive Pilot Program, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
