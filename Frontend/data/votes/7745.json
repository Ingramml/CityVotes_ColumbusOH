    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kenmore Construction Co., Inc. for the JPWWTP Disinfection Piping Replacement project, CIP #650260-102017, in an amount up to $1,128,278.40, and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $1,130,278.40. \n \nThis project will demolish the existing PVC sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite lines. The old chlorine gas lines that feed the induction units will also be removed. The PVC pipe will be replaced with HDPE piping that will run from the sodium hypochlorite and sodium bisulfite feed pumps to the respective induction units. The project will also replace flowmeters, pressure transmitters, pressure gauges, and heat tracing along the new pipe.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide, since the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant serves several Columbus Communities.\n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 620 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $1,128,278.40, including a 20% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                               $1,128,278.40\nFuture Anticipated Needs                          $            0.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $1,128,278.40\nPrevailing Wage Charge                          $      2,000.00\n                                                                                          $1,130,278.40\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe PVC piping is nearing the end of its useful life and some parts of the piping has been exposed to sunlight, which makes the PVC brittle. Replacing the existing PVC disinfection piping system with a HDPE piping system will make it last longer and is UV resistant. \n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 5/19/2023 through 6/12/2023.   Three bids were received:\n \n     Name                                          Bid Amount________City/State                    Status                     \nBowen Engineering Corporation        $938,196.00                 Indianapolis, IN                               MAJ\nKenmore Construction Co., Inc.                           $1,128,278.40                    Akron, OH                               MAJ\nThe Righter Co., Inc.                       $1,622,400.00                            Columbus, OH                               MAJ\n \nThe Bowen Engineering bid was deemed non-responsive due to not meeting the City MBE/WBE goal requirements.  The Kenmore Construction Co., Inc.’s bid was then evaluated and deemed the lowest, best, most responsive bid.  Kenmore Construction Co., Inc.’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract award.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nKenmore Construction Co., Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006456 and expires 11/21/24.  \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 8% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and Good Faith Effort submitted by Bowen Engineering, ODI deemed their bid non-responsive for not meeting the goal and for an insufficient Good Faith Effort.  \n \nThe next low bidder, Kenmore Construction Company, submitted a Utilization Plan meeting the 8% goal.  After review of their Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 8% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Kenmore Construction Co., Inc., has proposed the following four subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nSandel Corporation                                       Gahanna, Ohio                                                 WBE                                 \nHoward Painting Inc.                                   Defiance, Ohio                                                 MAJ\nKnight Electric LLC.                                   Columbus, Ohio                                                 MAJ\nRCP Metals, Inc.                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                             MBE                                   \n \nThe certification of the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nKenmore Construction Co., Inc. and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,130,278.40 is available and appropriated within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n8. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance. The project's completion is contingent upon the disinfection system being powered down and thoroughly purged by the plant, a process that typically can only occur from November to April each year when disinfection is not required.  A delay in the start of the process this year could result in the project taking three years to complete instead of two years, resulting in extra cost to the City.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Kenmore Construction Company for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant Disinfection Piping Replacement project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,130,278.40 for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,130,278.40)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the JPWWTP Disinfection Piping Replacement project; and\n \nWHEREAS, three bids for the JPWWTP Disinfection Piping Replacement project were received and opened on 6/21/23; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a construction services contract with Kenmore Construction Co., Inc. for the JPWWTP Disinfection Piping Replacement project; and \n \nWHEREAS, the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget must be modified to align budget authority with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for this project; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities in that it is immediately necessary to execute the contract due to the limited window when work can be performed during the time when disinfection is not needed, avoiding extra costs that will be incurred to perform work over a three-year period instead of the planned two year period, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget authorized by Ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority/ Revised Authority / Change \n6109 / P650257-100101 / JPWWTP Power Systems Upgrades and Safety Improvements - Phase 1 (Voted Sanitary Carryover) / $1,170,000.00 / $39,722.00 / ($1,130,278.00) \n6109 / P650260-102017 / JPWWTP Disinfection Piping Replacement (Voted Sanitary Carryover) / $0.00 / $1,130,278.00 / $1,130,278.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That the transfer of $1,130,278.40, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to enter into a construction services contract for the JPWWTP Disinfection Piping Replacement project with Kenmore Construction Co., Inc., 700 Home Avenue, Akron, OH 44310, in an amount up to $1,128,278.40, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Department of Public Utilities; and to pay the Department of Public Services an amount up to $2,000.00 to provide prevailing wage services.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the expenditure of up to $1,130,278.40, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized to transfer the unencumbered balance in a project account to the unallocated balance account within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies are no longer required for said project.\n \nSECTION 8.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is made a part hereof, this Ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten (10) days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes this Ordinance.",
