This modification is needed as funds are being expended at an increasing rate and they are needed to continue to provide rental and utility assistance to residents in the area who qualify for assistance. \n \nOriginal Agreement                      $1,750,000.00                     Ord. 1577-2023                      PO396840\nModification No. 1                         $1,250,000.00\nTotal                                                                $3,000,000.00\n \nOrdinance No. 1577-2023 which was approved on June 12, 2023 by council authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a sub-recipient agreement with Greenwood 360 LLC in an amount up to $1,750,000.00 of U.S. Department of Treasury Emergency Rental Assistance 2 (ERA2) funds.  The authorization allowed Greenwood 360 LLC to act as the Application Manager for recipients as part of the department’s ERA2 Investment Strategy with a start date of June 1, 2023 and waived the competitive bidding requirements in Columbus City Code Chapter 329. \n Ordinance No. 2275-2023 authorized the City of Columbus to accept and appropriate up to $90,537,806.23 of Federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA2) program funds, as passed by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021.\n \nGreenwood 360 LLC will continue to manage a program to provide rental and utility assistance to residents in the local area who qualify for the assistance as provided in the laws and regulations and other current guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Greenwood 360 LLC will work collaboratively to implement a plan to distribute ERA funds to eligible tenants with the Wells Foundation which will be processing payments and handling fiscal management of the program.\n \nFunds from the original contract are being expended quickly due to high need in the community for emergency rental assistance. \n \nEmergency action is requested as emergency rental assistance assists tenants facing housing instability, eviction, and potential homelessness.  \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 039806 and expires 09/08/2025.\n \nFiscal Impact: $1,250,000.00 is available from Emergency Rental Assistance 2 (ERA2) funds.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a sub-recipient agreement with Greenwood 360 LLC to add additional funds in an amount up to $1,250,000.00 to act as the Application Manager for recipients as part of the department’s ERA2 Investment Strategy and to declare an emergency.
