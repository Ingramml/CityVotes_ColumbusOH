    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into a contract with and issue a purchase order to ESO Solutions, Inc. for software integration and licensing.  The contract is necessary to provide Fire Incident Reporting via ESO's cloud-based software for the period covering December 1, 2023 through November 30, 2024.  This contract will provide incident reporting coverage until the current Request For Proposal (RFP) process is completed which solicits a replacement system.  A waiver of the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code, Chapter 329 is necessary for this purchase to accommodate the RFP process.  \n \nThis software platform provides for the Fire Division's incident reporting needs, with each of the approximately 170,000 calls for service taken per year requiring an incident report.  These reports are maintained as a records database, and must be retained as permanent records.  These incident reports are sent to the US Fire Administration and the Ohio Fire Marshal as mandated by Federal and State requirements.  In addition to these incident reports, this software platform manages all inspections conducted by the Columbus Fire Prevention Bureau, which total approximately 35,000 occupancies annually; accompanying the inspections are the issuance of fire permits, which generates $1.5M of revenue for the City annually.\n \nContract Compliance: ESO Solutions, Inc.
