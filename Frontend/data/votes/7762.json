Ready of the Diocese of Columbus to ensure women struggling with alcohol addiction were able to receive treatment; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Maryhaven has grown to become Central Ohio’s largest and most comprehensive behavioral health services provider specializing in addiction recovery and has served more than 300,000 men, women and adolescents since 1953; and,\nWHEREAS, Maryhaven has been an integral part of this community as it strives every day to bring hope, innovation and compassion to people struggling with mental illnesses and addiction disorders; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Maryhaven will continue to uplift our community from its Columbus campuses and regional clinics while providing comprehensive treatments for patients at all stages of recovery;\n \nWHEREAS, the intervention of three heroes saved Eva Simon’s life, without their selfless actions, her story would have likely had a more negative conclusion: Now, therefore, be it: and,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council recognize with gratitude Maryhaven will continue to uplift our community from its Columbus campuses and regional clinics while providing comprehensive treatments for patients at all stages of recovery;",
