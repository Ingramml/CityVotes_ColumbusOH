    "description": "Title\n \nTo Commend Anthony Masters, Joani Kesling, and Heather Clark for their Heroic Actions that Saved Eva Simon’s Life\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, on October 29th, 2022, Eva Simon was attacked by three pit bull terriers while walking her bike toward a biking trail; and\nWHEREAS, Eva tried to protect herself from attack by using her bike as a shield against the attacking dogs, however protection did not last and the dogs managed to bite her leg; and\n \nWHEREAS, the dogs brutally attacked her, causing major injuries to both of Eva’s legs and right arm; and\n \nWHEREAS, while hiking, Heather Clark noticed the brutal scene, and, attempting to intervene, used her hiking stick as a distraction for the dogs; and\n \nWHEREAS, Joani Kesling and Anthony Masters took notice of Heather’s stick while driving down the road and used their SUV to fend off the attacking dogs; and\n \nWHEREAS, after saving Eva’s life from the attacking dogs, the three heroes then gave her preliminary lifesaving medical attention while driving her to the nearest hospital; and\n \nWHEREAS, the intervention of three heroes saved Eva Simon’s life, without their selfless actions, her story would have likely had a more negative conclusion: Now, therefore, be it: and,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council commends the heroic efforts of Anthony Masters, Joani Kesling, and Heather Clark in saving Eva Simon’s life through their selfless action.",
