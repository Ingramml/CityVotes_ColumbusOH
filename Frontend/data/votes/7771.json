    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize New Salem Baptist Church and Celebrate Pastor Keith Troy’s 40th Pastoral Anniversary\nBody\nWHEREAS, New Salem Baptist Church is a Columbus institution, dating back to 1909 serving as a hub for the African American Baptist community; and\n \nWHEREAS, in October of 1983, Pastor Keith Troy accepted the call to begin his ministry at New Salem and ushered in a period of unprecedented growth and success for the church; and \n \nWHEREAS, under Pastor Troy, New Salem’s membership grew from just 66 members to over 800 within 5 years, prompting a search to find a new home for the historic community; and\n \nWHEREAS, that search led them to the site of the former Columbus Baptist Temple, which New Salem has now called home since 1988; and\n \nWHEREAS, Pastor Troy has remained flexible and aware of the changing needs of the community and led Columbus residents through both times of prosperity and struggle with an unwavering commitment to those who come to him and seek guidance; and\n \nWHEREAS, Pastor Troy has helped firmly entrench New Salem in the Columbus Community with meaningful programs such as childcare, food pantries, scholarship funds, and counseling and career development services, and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus thanks Pastor Troy for his faithful service and wishes him and the entire New Salem community a joyous celebration of 40 years of success under his leadership; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council recognizes New Salem Baptist Church and celebrates Pastor Keith Troy’s 40th Pastoral Anniversary.",
