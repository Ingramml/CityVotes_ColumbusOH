    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT), to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Purchase Agreement (PA) for Microsoft Enterprise software licensing. It also authorizes the expenditure of $223,994.03 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.\n \nMicrosoft Office is the city’s technology standard for desktop computing software, currently used by approximately 7,500 city employees in their daily business.  The city also utilizes Microsoft software to support a number of enterprise applications. This “true-up” ordinance will enable the city to continue to obtain the latest versions of Microsoft software utilizing a single agreement for the entire city.\n \nOn October 25th, 2020, the Department of Finance’s Purchasing Office published RFQ016877 to solicit quotes for a new three-year Microsoft Enterprise Agreement PA. The five submissions received in response to the solicitation are as follows: Crayon Software Experts; Dell Marketing, LP; Insight Public Sector; SHI International; and Softchoice. Following a three-person committee evaluation, the quote submitted by Dell Marketing, LP was deemed the most responsible, responsive, and best offer. As such, the Purchasing Office recommended that the UTC/PA be awarded to Dell Marketing, LP for a term of three years, expiring on December 31, 2023.  This ordinance only authorizes the third and final “true-up” for 2023. As the current contract with Dell Marketing LP expires on December 31, 2023, DoT will solicit quotes for the 2023 annual enterprise license.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the above-described purchases are budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating fund.\n \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION\nMicrosoft Office is the technology standard for desktop computing software that is used by City employees. The current agreement expires on December 31, 2023. Emergency action is requested to avoid any interruption of services to any city agency that relies on the service(s) that this vendor provides. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nDell Marketing LP, Vendor: #010030\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the appropriate Purchase Agreement for Microsoft enterprise software licensing “true-up” costs; to authorize the expenditure of $223,994.03 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
