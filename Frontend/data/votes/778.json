    "description": "Title\n \nTo designate May as Mental Illness Awareness Month in the City of Columbus and recognize the work of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Franklin County and the pediatric mental health and other related services offered by Nationwide Children’s Hospital. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Mental health is essential to our overall health, and the importance of attending to mental health has become even more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not only negatively impacted many people’s mental health but has also created barriers to treatment; millions of adults and children across America experience mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder - nearly one in five Americans lives with a mental health condition; those living with mental health conditions are our family, friends, classmates, neighbors, and coworkers; one of the guiding principles of community mental health care has been its commitment to a comprehensive, consumer-responsive delivery of services; and\n \nWHEREAS, NAMI Franklin County provides education, support, and advocacy to individuals with mental illness and their family of caregivers regardless of their clients age, gender, race, ethnicity, religious or economic status - the organization has worked to raise awareness about mental health, mental illness, and has continued to fight against the stigmas that are associated with mental illness; NAMI has expanded its work during the Month of May to include 15 billboards around Franklin County to promote mental health awareness; partnered with the African American Mental Health Beauty and Barber Campaign to create a drive to raise awareness for an additional 50,000 people; and expanded its work beyond the school with the Sources of Strength initiative to include community-based programs in kids centered places like recreation centers and other spaces; the program provides year around training and mental health support to adults and kids; and\n \nWHEREAS, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, formerly known as Children's Hospital of Columbus, opened in 1892 -  it is now a nationally ranked pediatric acute care teaching hospital located on the south side of Columbus with 673 pediatric beds, providing comprehensive pediatric specialties and sub-specialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0-21 - the Hospital features a designated Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and provides trauma, grief, violence, juvenile justice, family support services, pediatric mental health services and more to its patients;  Nationwide Children’s Hospital has been ranked as one of America's Best Children's Hospitals by US News & World Report;  and in 2020, it was ranked as the 7th best overall children's hospital in the United States; and\n \nWHEREAS, The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis has impacted the mental health of millions of Americans. Isolation, sickness, grief, job loss, food instability, and loss of routines has increased the need for mental health services - the Pandemic has reminded us of the  vital role that our mental health plays in our emotional, physical, and psychological well-being - it has raised our awareness regarding mental illness, the importance of family  and community and highlighted the limited access to mental health services and other health care services that are often out of reach for under-served communities; now therefore, \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \n \nThat this Council does hereby designate May as Mental Illness Awareness Month in the City of Columbus and recognize the work of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Franklin County and the pediatric mental health and other related services offered by Nationwide Children’s Hospital.\n \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT: \n \nThis Council does hereby thank the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Franklin County and Nationwide Children’s Hospital for the education, support and advocacy that they provide to improve the Mental Health of the residents of Columbus and Franklin County -Moreover this Council expresses its ongoing commitment to ensuring that people living with mental health conditions are treated with compassion, respect, and understanding - This Council  is  acutely aware of the disparities experienced by under-served communities, and communities of color, and expresses its ongoing support for organizations that provide and ensure access to affordable, quality, and evidence-based mental health care services.",
