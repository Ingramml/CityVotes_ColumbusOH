    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.  Background:  The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Ohio Health Corporation, asking that the City transfer them a 0.137 acre portion of the Chase Alley right-of-way.  The right-of-way area, aka Chase Alley and unnamed alley, runs north/south directionally for 210’ and is 20’ in width.  It is abutted by Oak Street at the north and State Street at the south.  The unnamed alley runs east/west directionally for 270’ and is 10’ in width.  It is abutted by Grant Avenue at the east and a building at 80 S. 6th Street at the west.  The portion dead-ends at the building with no type of driveway, garage door, or any access to the building.  Right-of-way areas intersect with each other.  All surrounding parcels are owned by OhioHealth Corporation and/or their partners.  Surrounding PIDs are 010-035689, 010-054642, 010-054636, 010-054635, 010-037895, 010-029631, 010-020010, and 010-051805.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will allow OhioHealth to utilize the previously mentioned right-of-way to combine with adjacent parcels they currently own for the development of additional parking and ambulatory care services. Currently, they are planning to develop a 400-500 care parking garage and 20,000-40,000 sf of medical office space on the combined surface parking areas across from the Grant Hospital main entrance.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $29.00 per square foot was established.  This value is at a reduced easement retention value.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on August 17, 2023.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Ohio Health Corporation at complete mitigation and will be transferred at no cost to them.  \n                     \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:  The City will receive no funds for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of 0.137 acre portion of Chase Alley to Ohio Health Corporation.
