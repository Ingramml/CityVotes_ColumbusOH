    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Evans, Mechwart Hambleton & Tilton, Inc. DBA EMH&T to provide professional services associated with the Mock Park and Anheuser Busch Park Development Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $99,910.00 with a contingency of $23,000.00 for a total amount of $122,910.00.\n \nThis modification includes the addition of pickleball courts at Krumm Park, located at 854 Alton Avenue. The 37.4 acre park currently includes Adams Community Center, a pond, athletic fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, and a playground. The Recreation and Parks Department is planning to add three pickleball courts in the eastern quadrant of the park adjacent to Rarig Avenue. Additionally, there will be fencing, storage, and utility improvements as part of this project. The utility improvements will include lighting for fields and parking lots. \n \nThe pickleball courts at Krumm Park were originally included in the request for proposals for this project but were later removed due to uncertainty surrounding the scope and budget. As the project has progressed, staff has determined that the scope for Krumm Park would mirror what is occurring at Busch Park. EMH&T has also recently developed the new pickleball standards for both Mock and Busch Parks. Therefore, it would be most efficient and cost effective to procure these services as part of the existing contract. This will also keep the schedule for construction and programming on course, meeting expectations of the community as EMH&T will be best suited to deliver this additional scope efficiently. Fees for the contract modification were determined using existing hourly rates that were established by the existing contract.\n  \nPrincipal Parties: \nEvans, Mechwart Hambleton & Tilton, Inc. DBA EMH&T \n5500 New Albany Road\nColumbus, Ohio 43054\nJim Dziatkowicz, (614) 775-4703\nContract Compliance Number: 004214\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 16, 2024\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to allow the consultant to stay on schedule for bidding the construction work in the spring of 2024 and open the courts to the public by the fall of 2024.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the pickleball amenities and programs the City can offer to the public. These improvements will make the City a major destination for pickleball programs and tournaments for all levels of play, from recreational to professional.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Community input for this project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports and Leisure International (CSL) in the summer of 2021. Input was also gathered from internal Columbus Recreation and Parks Department stakeholders and the Mayor’s office. \n \nArea(s) Affected: East Columbus (50)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to update sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $465,800.00 was legislated for the Mock Park and Anheuser Busch Park Development Project by Ordinance 0441-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $122,910.00. $122,910.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $588,710.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Evans, Mechwart Hambleton & Tilton, Inc.
