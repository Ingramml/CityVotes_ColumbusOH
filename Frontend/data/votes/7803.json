($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio EPA requires this ordinance which authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to apply for and execute Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) loan agreements in 2024 for the design and construction of Sanitary, Stormwater, and Treatment Engineering Capital Improvement Projects as identified in Section 1 of this ordinance, under the direction of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD).  This loan program is jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA). The WPCLF Loan Fund program provides below-market interest rate loans for municipal Wastewater and Stormwater system improvements. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities anticipates applying for loan funding for the projects listed in Section 1 of this ordinance.  However, it may become necessary to add or subtract from this list of projects depending upon project schedule adjustments, departmental need, or the loan agency deciding a project is not eligible for funding.  The dollar amount of each loan will be based upon bids received for construction services projects, or after professional service contract pricing has been negotiated as part of the City's Request for Proposal process for design projects.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is sufficient budget authority in the 2024 Sewer Systems and Stormwater Operating Funds for the loan application fee expenditures.  These loans will be paid off over a 20-year period from Sewerage System and Stormwater rates (dedicated source of repayment).  Sewerage System and Stormwater rate increases have been projected and planned in anticipation of these projects and loans.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to apply for, accept, and enter into Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund Loan Agreements with the Ohio Water Development Authority and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for the financing of Division of Sewerage and Drainage design and construction projects; and to designate a dedicated source of repayment for the loans.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS,  the Department of Public Utilities is scheduled to prepare loan applications for submittal to the Ohio EPA under the Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF) program to finance, through below-market interest rate loans, the design and construction of capital improvements projects under the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, which said financial assistance may be of help in reducing total project costs to the City's Sewerage and Stormwater customers; and\n \nWHEREAS, prior to WPLCF loan agreement approval by the Ohio Water Development Authority, the WPCLF loan application and loan agreement documents require the City to submit to the Ohio EPA a certified copy of approved City Council legislation authorizing the Director of the Public Utilities Department to apply for and subsequently execute said WPCLF agreements, and to authorize a dedicated source of loan repayment for the loans; and\n \nWHEREAS, it may become necessary to add or subtract to the list of projects anticipated to apply for Ohio Water Pollution Control Loan Fund financing due to schedule adjustments, departmental need, or the loaning agency deciding a project is not eligible for a loan; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities to authorize the Director to apply for, accept and enter into WPCLF loan agreements with Ohio Water Development Authority and submit a copy of this legislation to the Ohio EPA prior to the OWDA board's consideration for approval as part of the loan agreements’ approval process; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to apply for, accept, and enter into Water Pollution Control Loan Fund Loan Agreements with the Ohio Water
