    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify (Modification No. 1) a contract with Concord Buckeye Hotel LLC, in an amount up to $29,000.00, to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program and to extend the contract for an additional year.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000.00                     PO360449                     PY 2023\nModification No. 1                                          $29,000.00                                                               PY 2023 & 2024\nTotal Contract Amount                                          $74,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazzard Control and Healthy Homes (HUD) grant in late 2019.  The original grant term was 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Department of Development’s Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide hotel services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe director of the Department of Development executed the contract in December 2022 with Concord Buckeye Hotel LLC under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  After many unsuccessful procurement attempts for hotel services, it was determined to be “manifestly impractical” to continue to redo the procurement process.  Concord Buckeye Hotel LLC had provided services in the past and the rates provided for this contract are reasonable and in align with the other hotels providing services under this program.  Purchase order PO360449 with Concord Buckeye Hotel LLC was created on December 21, 2022, and expires on December 31, 2023.  This legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2024.  The federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant and the department has used this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program with under PO360489.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.\n \nThe department applied for and received an extension of the grant and the modification of this contract will provide services to recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program through the term of the grant.  This legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2024.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n$23,000.00 is available within the 2019 LEAD Grant (G441900) and $6,000.00 is available within Housing Division’s 2023 General Fund budget for this purpose.  Two POs will be created from the ACPO, one funded from grant funds and one funded from the general fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 012281 and expires 11/18/2024.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify a contract with Concord Buckeye Hotel LLC in an amount up to $29,000.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program; to extend the contract for one additional year; to authorize the expenditure of up to $23,000.00 from the General Government Grant Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $6,000.00 from the General Fund.
