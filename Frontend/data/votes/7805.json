    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify (Modification No. 1) a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC dba Homewood Suites in an amount up to $6,000.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program and to extend the contract for an additional year.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000.00                     N/A                                            PO220351                     PY 2020\nRenewal No. 1                                                               $         0.00                     Ord. 2723-2020                                                               PY 2021                     \nRenewal No. 2                                                               $22,000.00                     Ord. 3043-2021                       PO306789                     PY 2022\nRenewal No. 3                                                               $67,000.00                     Ord. 2874-2022                       PO361395                     PY 2023\nModification No. 1                                          $6,000.00                                                                                                         PY 2023 & 2024                     \nTotal Contract Amount                                          140,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (HUD) grant in late 2019.  The original grant term was 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Department of Development’s Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide hotel services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2019 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program. Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with two bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19. The original contract was PO220351 and expired December 31, 2021.  The federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department has used this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program with contracts under PO306789 and PO361395.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals. \n \nOrdinance 2874-2022 renewed the contract for an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  The department applied for and received an extension of the grant and the modification of this contract will provide services to recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program through the term of the grant.  This legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2024.  \n \nRecently, HUD notified grant recipients that HUD may deny relocation costs for hotel services that exceed ten days.  Because of this, $6,000.00 of this modification to the contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC dba Homewood Suites will be provided by the General Fund to cover ineligible grant expenses.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $6,000.00 is available within Housing Division’s 2023 General Fund budget for this purpose.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 031229 and expires 10/14/2024.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify a contract with H.S. Heritage Inn of Columbus Opco LLC dba Homewood Suites in an amount up to $6,000.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program; to extend the contract for one additional year; to authorize the expenditure of up to $6,000.00 from the General Fund.
