    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis legislation will allow the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HAD) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) for the Country Ridge affordable housing community, which will ultimately be funded with $2,000,000.00 from a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond. Once funds become available, an ordinance will be brought to Council to authorize a grant agreement.\n \nCountry Ridge is currently an affordable housing community consisting of (96) units with a (50) unit Project Based Voucher HAP Contract that is owned by Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority. The development is located at 5656 Farmhouse Lane, Hilliard, Ohio 43026. The project consists of (48) two-bedroom units and (48) three-bedroom units and built in 1998.\n \nRenovations to Country Ridge will include new kitchens and baths, flooring, appliances, HVAC, water heaters, window treatments, siding, windows and roofs.\n \nAll residents will have access to CMHA’s RISE Center.  CMHA's RISE Center serves as a centralized hub that provides access to valuable community resources for CMHA residents. The RISE Center can help residents coordinate access to supportive services in the following four areas: Economic Empowerment, Educational Advancement, Health & Wellness, and Character & Leadership.\n \nSome examples of available services include: Applying for emergency rental assistance, utility bill payment plans, and understanding your lease agreement.  Signing up for health insurance, unemployment, and food assistance. Finding employment, housing, medical care, and educational opportunities. Managing health and well-being, including understanding illnesses and medications. Family planning, pregnancy care, and care for the entire family.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide evidence of city funding by the closing date anticipated for late October 2023.  The City’s funding commitment is critical for the closing to proceed, as this is also a HUD Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) project, and cannot wait 30 days after legislation passes.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is needed.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 006216 and expires September 8, 2025.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA) for the Country Ridge affordable housing community; and to declare an emergency.
