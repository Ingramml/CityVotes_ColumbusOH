    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to accept and execute a reimbursable Lead-Safe Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Grant, in an amount up to $1,424,543.00, from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH).  The grant will be utilized by the Department of Development and Columbus Public Health.  The grant term ends June 30, 2025.  \n \nThe ODH-RRP grant will allow the department to continue to create lead-safe housing in high-risk zip codes by conducting lead-safe renovations on windows, doors, and porches in homes built before 1978.  These grant funds may be used in conjunction with other Division of Housing program funds to address both interior and exterior lead issues.  \n \nWorking with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, grant funds will be used to fund training for aspiring contractors to receive their RRP certification thereby increasing the number of small to medium sized RRP contractors and strengthening the local lead hazard control workforce.  In partnership with Columbus Public Health (CPH), grant funds will be used to increase knowledge of the importance of blood lead testing for medical professionals and caregivers.  CPH will also increase awareness of lead hazards and prevention practices.  \n \nColumbus City Code (CCC) 111.14 states that “All programs which award loans or grants of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) must submit legislation for approval to city council”;  CCC 329.18 states, “No contract greater than $50,000.00 awarded under this section shall be effective until approved by ordinance of city council; and CCC 329.09 states “After agreeing upon the terms of a modification, the city agency shall submit legislation to city council requesting approval of the modification…”  \n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to create a purchase order in the name of the contractor and to do so if the amount is greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement as needed to carry out the purposes of the grant program, without having to return to Council for each project  This authorization allows the department to expend the funds in a timely manner and provides program flexibility in the event of unforeseen conditions.\n \nThe cost of remediation work in a residence is typically under $50,000.00.  However, there may be instances where the cost is greater than $50,000.00. Remediation includes removal of mold, lead, and other similar toxins.  The department has a list of prequalified contractors who, through a bid rotation system, bid on the work under the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program.  After a bidder is chosen from the public bidding process, the department enters into a grant agreement with the homeowner for the work and creates a purchase order in the name of the contractor to pay the contractor directly. \n \nThis legislation is submitted as an emergency to allow for the execution of the grant agreement and the appropriation and expenditure of funds so that the funds can be fully encumbered and expended within the term of the grant.  Failure to do so may result in funds being returned, lead remediation not done, and increases in health issues related to continued exposure to lead.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This legislation requests the appropriation and expenditure of $1,424,543.00 from the General Government Grant Fund (Fund 2220).  The grant number shall be determined after the grant is executed by the parties.\n \n$1,176,500.00 of the grant is appropriated in the Department of Development, of which $1,000,000.00 will be put an Auditors Certificate Purchase Order (ACPO) to be expended for RRP work and $176,500.00 shall be available in the budget for the purchase of goods and services, as required by Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n$248,043.00 of the grant is to be appropriated and expended by Columbus Public Health, all for goods and services, as required by Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Director of the Department of Development to accept and execute a reimbursable grant agreement, up to $1,424,543.00, from the Ohio Department of Health; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure up to $1,176,500.00 for  the Department of Development in the General Governmental Grant fund; to authorize the Director of Department of Development to execute Grant Agreements with homeowners for grant amounts greater than $5,000.00, and to approve purchase orders with selected contractors if the purchase order is greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement without having to return to City Council for each project; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure up to $248,043.00 for Columbus Public Health in the General Government Grant fund; to authorize the expenditure of all funds effective the start date of the grant; and to declare an emergency.
