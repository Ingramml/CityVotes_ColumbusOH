    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the contract with Righter Company, Inc. for specialty maintenance crafts services (FEM Project No. 0101.6). This modification No. 2 is to add additional funding for repairs at various Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD), Division of Power (DOP), and Division of Water (DOW) facilities.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code (RFQ013910). Two Hundred and Ninety Five (295) vendors were solicited and one (1) bid from Righter Company, Inc. was received and opened on November 6, 2019. The bid from Righter Company, Inc. was awarded as the lowest, responsive, responsible and best bid received. \n \nThe original contract was for a period of one year with three (3) one year renewal options on an annual basis and contingent upon mutual agreement, availability of funding and Columbus City Council approval. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that require additional funding, a modification will be requested. This modification pertains to the last year of a four-year contract, extending it by eight months until September 21, 2024, to ensure the work can be completed during the spring and summer seasons. The existing contract is scheduled to conclude on January 21, 2024. The contract will be rebid during the summer of 2024.\n \nThe work to be performed under this contract will be the repair, modification, and/or replacement of various WWTP, Compost Facility, Sewage Maintenance Operations Center, WTP, substations or other DPU facility components and associated equipment such as: bar racks, sluice gates, pumping systems, aeration systems including blowers, settling tanks, disinfection chemical systems, chemical storage and feed systems, gravity thickeners, centrifuges, digesters, etc.  Auxiliary equipment such as low pressure boilers, transformers, HVAC units, miscellaneous piping and ductwork, roofs, building architectural repairs, vent stacks, walkways, stairways, handrails, pavement repairs/ replacements,  miscellaneous hard-surfacing and concrete work, painting, and installation and demolition of equipment may be included in the work. The work to be performed is minor or small in relation to the total system or plant process. Current facilities to be serviced are Division of Sewerage & Drainage (DOSD), Division of Water (DOW) and Division of Power (DOP) facilities.\n \nThe contract will continue to provide Specialty Maintenance Crafts Services for the Department of Public Utilities facilities.  Anticipated DOSD work for this modification includes items such as Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) RSP discharge pump 2 and 3 piping temporary joint repairs, SMOC Hallway flooring repair/ replacement, Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) Pump Station Stair/Railing improvements, JPWWTP Whittier Street electrical wiring replacement and door switch installation, JPWWTP OARS gate/ fence repair &  clearing.  DOP anticipated work includes additional light pole foundation repairs, and electrical vault repairs and grating replacement. DOW anticipated work includes lagoon pump, valves and piping replacement at Parsons Ave Water Treatment Plant.\n \n1.                     Amount of additional funds: Total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification No. 2 is $1,450,000.00 for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD), $325,000.00 for the Division of Water (DOW), and $250,000.00 for the Division of Power (DOP), for a total contract modification amount of $2,025,000.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $6,087,439.00.\n \n2.                     Reason additional funds were not foreseen:  The need for additional funding was known at the time of the original contract. The original legislation, Ordinance No. 3014 2019, anticipated the contract would be funded incrementally with three renewals on an approximately annual basis. This modification is to provide the necessary funding for services provided through September 21, 2024.\n \n3.                     Reason other procurement processes not used:  Work under this modification is a continuation of services included in the scope of the original bid contract. No lower pricing/more attractive terms and conditions are anticipated at this time.\n \n4.                     How cost was determined: The cost, terms and conditions to provide specialty maintenance crafts services for DPU facility equipment and components are in accordance with the original contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nRighter Company, Inc. | EIN 31 0889208 | D365 Vendor #004433 | Expires November 22, 2023\nRighter Company, Inc. does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$2,025,000.00 is budgeted and needed for this contract modification.\n \nLabor:                                      $825,000.00 (DOSD)\nMaterials:                             $625,000.00 (DOSD), $325,000.00 (DOW), $250,000.00 (DOP)\nTotal:                                          $2,025,000.00                     \n \nDivision of Sewerage & Drainage\n$374,398.44 has been spent in 2023\n$801,923.26 has been spent in 2022\n$776,176.38 was spent in 2021 \n \nDivision of Water\n$0.00 has been spent in 2023\n$0.00 has been spent in 2022\n$0.00 was spent in 2021\n \nDivision of Power\n$108,734.65 has been spent in 2023\n$115,824.02 has been spent in 2022\n$163,205.99 was spent in 2021\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the specialty maintenance crafts services contract with Righter Company, Inc. for the Department of Public Utilities; and to authorize the expenditure of $1,450,000.00 from the Sewer Operating Fund, $325,000.00 from the Water Operating Fund and $250,000.00 from the Power Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
