    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The need exists to amend the Downtown Office Incentive Agreement between the City of Columbus (“CITY”) and Coastal Ridge Real Estate Partners, LLC, Coastal Ridge Management, LLC, PPG Management, LLC and Foxen Insurance Company, LLC (collectively and hereafter referred to as “GRANTEE”).  Columbus City Council (“COUNCIL”), per Ordinance No. 2561-2019, passed October 14, 2019, authorized the Director of the Department of Development of the CITY to enter into a Downtown Office Incentive Agreement (the “DOI AGREEMENT”) for an annual cash payment equal to fifty percent (50%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the payroll for new employees added to the City of Columbus for a term of up to five (5) consecutive years.  The financial incentive was granted in consideration of the GRANTEE’s total proposed investment of approximately $300,000.00, which included $156,000.00 in machinery and equipment, $120,000.00 in stand-alone computers, and $24,000.00 in furniture and fixtures to relocate and expand its corporate headquarters (HQ) into the newly constructed commercial office space known as “80 on the Commons” located at 80 E. Rich Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215, parcel number 010-296465 (the “PROJECT SITE”).  Additionally, the GRANTEE committed to create 80 net new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $6,138,700.00, and to retain and relocate 75 full-time positions with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $5,793,200.00 (the (“PROJECT”), which will be new jobs to the CITY but not incentivized at the PROJECT SITE.  The DOI AGREEMENT was made and entered into effective January 10, 2020 with the incentive term to begin January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024 for a 5-year credit.  \n \nParagraph four within Section 13 (Miscellaneous) of the AGREEMENT states, “No amendment of modification shall be effective unless in writing and signed by both parties to this agreement.  Any requested amendment or modification to any of the terms of the AGREEMENT made to the CITY by the GRANTEE shall require the payment to the CITY by the GRANTEE of an AMENDMENT FEE in the amount of two-hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).”\n \nThe DOI AGREEMENT was amended for the first time (“FIRST AMENDMENT”) pursuant to Ordinance No. 1914-2021, approved by COUNCIL on July 19, 2021 which the GRANTEE was granted an additional year on the incentive term.  Unfortunately, the project was delayed due to the affects from the COVID-19 global pandemic. The GRANTEE requested that the incentive term of the DOI AGREEMENT be amended from “beginning January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024” to “beginning January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2025”, thereby giving the GRANTEE another year to complete the proposed PROJECT. The FIRST AMENDMENT was entered into effective September 21, 2021.\n \nSubsequently, in a letter received by the CITY dated October 3, 2023, and through ensuing correspondence, it was confirmed that one of the entities of the GRANTEE changed its name from Foxen Insurance Company to Foxen Administration, LLC. As a result of the 2019 expansion project, the GRANTEE’s common owners decided to fill a broader need in their marketplace by commercializing resident insurance compliance monitoring and property damage liability waiver program services, and establishing Foxen Insurance Company. During its progression, the company commenced an organizational restructuring and forming a new limited liability company, Foxen Administration, LLC who serves as the operating company and employer of record. Additionally, the GRANTEE expanded operation into a second location that is also located within the downtown boundaries.  The GRANTEE is requesting that the DOI AGREEMENT be amended to (i) change one of the GRANTEE entities name from Foxen Insurance Company to Foxen Administration, LLC, and (ii) to add 333 W. Nationwide Blvd. Columbus, OH 43215, parcel number: 010-279858 as an additional location to the PROJECT SITE.\n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the DOI AGREEMENT for the second time to (1) change one of the GRANTEE’s entity name from Foxen Insurance Company to Foxen Administration, LLC, and (2) to add 333 W. Nationwide Blvd. Columbus, OH 43215, parcel number: 010-279858 as an additional location to the PROJECT SITE.\n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Downtown Office Incentive Agreement with Coastal Ridge Real Estate Partners, LLC, Coastal Ridge Management, LLC, PPG Management, LLC and Foxen Insurance Company, LLC for the second time to (1) change one of the GRANTEE’s entity name from Foxen Insurance Company to Foxen Administration, LLC, and (2) to add 333 W.
