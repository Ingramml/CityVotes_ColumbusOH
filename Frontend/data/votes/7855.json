Participating youth will embark on a journey to visit a diverse array of culturally enriching destinations, including museums, parks, historical landmarks, and colleges. These experiences are thoughtfully designed to educate youth, equipping them to emerge as well-rounded and enlightened adults.\n \nThe Exposure is Key initiative is expected to impact 150 youth between the ages of 6 and 15.\n \nFunding will support participation fees, travel, lodging, tutoring, and other associated supplies and services for the students.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to ensure the organization receives financial support in a timely manner, with the initiative’s student experience and travel beginning on December 2, 2023.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Legacy Youth Sports Academy, dba Legacy Youth Academy, in support of the Exposure Is Key Initiative; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Jobs Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
