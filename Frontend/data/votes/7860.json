    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from the State of Ohio and its successors and assigns, for the use and benefit of The Ohio State University, asking that the City transfer them a 0.109 acre portion of the West Norwich Avenue right-of-way.  Right-of-way area is adjacent to, and rear of, 322 and 328 West Lane Avenue. i. e. PID 010-077353 and PID 010-077351.\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will be to take ownership of the area which contains the building’s retaining wall addressed to 322 and 328 W Lane Ave for maintenance and security purposes.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way via a quitclaim deed as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $80.00 per square foot for the portion was established.  This value is at a reduced easement retention value.  \n \nThis request went before the Land Review Commission on March 16, 2023.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to the State of Ohio and its successors and assigns, for the use and benefit of The Ohio State University, at complete mitigation and will be transferred at no cost to them and a general utility easement will be retained.  \n                     \nFISCAL IMPACT: The City will receive no funds for the transfer of the requested right-of-way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the transfer of 0.109 acre portion of West Norwich Avenue right-of-way to the State of Ohio and its successors and assigns, for the use and benefit of The Ohio State University.
