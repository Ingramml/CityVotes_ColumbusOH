    "description": "EXPLANATION\n \nCity Council has authorized an extension of military leave benefits annually for employees who are called to perform service in the uniformed services. This legislation extends that benefit indefinitely.  \n \nTITLE\n \nTo authorize and extend a continuation of military leave with pay to City employees eligible for such leave who have and/or will be members of the uniformed services who are called to perform service in the uniformed services; to allow for the continuation of City-provided group health and life insurance, under the same terms and conditions currently in effect for City employees and their beneficiaries; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBODY\n \nWHEREAS, City Council previously passed continued military leave with pay for City employees who have been, or may be called to perform service in the uniformed services pursuant to an order by the President of the United States, because of an act of Congress, or because of an order to perform duty issued by the governor pursuant to Ohio Revised Code §5919.29: and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council desires to extend that benefit through this ordinance indefinitely and to remain in effect unless updated or modified through legislative action of this body; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council desires to maintain health and life insurance benefits for affected employees and their beneficiaries; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City is desirous of supporting and assisting those City employees and their families who have been or will be financially burdened by the employee being called to perform service in the uniformed services by continuing affected employees in military-leave-with-pay status for the period designated in the order or act under competent authority, and for the duration of service in the uniformed services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to continue such financial assistance to affected employees and beneficiaries to avoid a lapse in benefits, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1. That salaries and wages be paid to affected employees in accordance with federal and state law, management compensation plans, and/or the respective collective bargaining agreements in order to keep employees in paid status beyond the initial period of military leave with pay for the ensuing year effective November 23, 2020 and for the duration of the employee's service in the uniformed services, less whatever amount such employee may receive as military basic pay for the applicable year as published and maintained by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), available at https://www.dfas.mil. \n \nSection 2. That the health and life insurance provided to City employees, pursuant to federal and state law, the various management compensation plans, and/or collective bargaining agreements between the City of Columbus and the Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9; International Association of Fire Fighters, Local 67; American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 1632 and Local 2191; Communications Workers of America Local 4502; the Fraternal Order of Police/Ohio Labor Council, Inc. be continued in full force and effect subject to the same definitions, limitations, and exclusions as are found in the above-referenced federal and state law, collective bargaining agreements, and/or management compensation plans as well as those contracts and agreements between the Department of Human Resources and the various insurance providers, for those City employees who have been or may be called to perform service in the uniformed services for the ensuing year effective November 23, 2020.\n \nSection 3.

That the City shall provide City employees no fewer rights and benefits than may be conferred under federal or state law if such a conflict should exist between this ordinance and any applicable federal or state law. Any management compensation plan, collective bargaining agreement may afford greater benefits than conferred under this ordinance but none administered by the City may afford fewer rights and benefits than are conferred under this ordinance.\n \nSection 5.
