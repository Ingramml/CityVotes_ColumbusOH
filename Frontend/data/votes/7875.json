    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify (Modification No. 1) a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC. dba Townplace Suites Columbus Easton, in an amount up to $16,000.00, to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program and to extend the contract for an additional year.\n \nOriginal contract amount                     $50,000.00                     Ord. 0323-2022                       PO360489                      PY 2022\nRenewal No. 1                                                               $         0.00                     Ord. 2921-2022                                                               PY 2023\nModification No. 1                                          $16,000.00                                                                                                         PY 2023 & 2024                     \nTotal Contract Amount                                          $66,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (HUD) grant in late 2019.  The original grant term was 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Department of Development’s Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide hotel services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014458 on Vendor Services in December 2019 for hotel services for the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program. Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with two bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19. The original contract was PO258533 and expired December 31, 2021.  Because contract renewal number 1, authorized under ordinance 3044-2021, was not executed before the original contract expired, an additional ordinance (Ord. No. 0323-2022) was needed to provide services in 2022. The federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant and the department has used this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program with contract PO360489.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  \n \nOrdinance 2921-2022 renewed the contract for an additional year, ending December 31, 2023.  The department applied for and received an extension of the grant and the modification of this contract will provide services to recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program through the term of the grant.  This legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2024.  \n \nRecently, HUD notified grant recipients that HUD may deny relocation costs for hotel services that exceed ten days.  Because of this, $4,000.00 of this modification to the contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC. dba Townplace Suites Columbus Easton will be provided by the General Fund to cover ineligible grant expenses.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $12,000.00 is available within the 2019 LEAD Grant (GG441900) and $4,000.00 is available within Housing Division’s 2023 General Fund budget for this purpose.  Two POs will be created from the ACPO, one funded from grant funds and one funded from the general fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 033213 and expires 10/14/2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to modify a contract with Morse Transit Acquisitions, LLC. dba Townplace Suites Columbus Easton in an amount up to $16,000.00 to provide hotel services for recipients of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program; to extend the contract for one additional year; to authorize the expenditure of up to $12,000.00 from the General Government Grant Fund; and to authorize the transfer of up to $4,000.00 within the General Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $4,000.00 from the General Fund.
