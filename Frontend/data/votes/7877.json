Stout, in collaboration with the County and the City, local legal aid providers, and other interested parties, will conduct research and data gathering regarding the impacts of eviction on low-income tenants and the County and the City (separately) as well as the benefits that could be realized if low-income tenants were represented in eviction proceedings in the County and the City. The objective of the engagement is to quantify the costs and benefits, where possible, to calculate an expected return on investment, for both the County and the City, separately.\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is necessary.\nContract Compliance: the vendor number is 043486 and expires 10/28/2024\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with Stout Risius Ross, LLC to extend the term of the agreement which expires on December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024, in order to complete the work and expend all of the funds encumbered.
