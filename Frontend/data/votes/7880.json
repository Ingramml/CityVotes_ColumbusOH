    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify to extend the term of the agreement from December 31, 2023 until December 31, 2024, with Home and Commercial Inspections LLC to continue to provide radon testing services.  \n \nOriginal                                          $  14,612.50                     Ord. 1115-2022                     PO379816\nMod 1                                          $          0.00\nTotal                                          $  14,612.50\n \nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded nearly $104.7 million to 60 non-profit organizations, and state and local government agencies located in 29 states to protect children and families from home health hazards.  HUD is providing these grants through its Healthy Homes Production Grant Program which will help grantees identify health and safety hazards in low-income families’ homes. The grants will protect children and families with incomes at or below eighty percent of the area median income level by targeting significant lead and health hazards in over 7,400 low-income homes for which other resources are not available.  The Healthy Homes Production Grant Program takes a comprehensive approach to addressing multiple childhood diseases and injuries in the home by focusing on housing-related hazards in a coordinated fashion, rather than addressing a single hazard at a time. The program builds upon HUD’s successful Lead Hazard Control programs to expand the Department’s efforts to holistically address a variety of high-priority housing-based health and safety hazards, such as mold and moisture, poor indoor air quality, pests, carbon monoxide, injury and safety hazards, in addition to lead-based paint. \n \nThis modification will extend the term of the contract to continue to provide radon testing services as authorized per the Healthy Homes Production Grant through December 31, 2024. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is necessary.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 040111 and expires 11/10/2023.  They are currently working on recertifying their contract compliance and it will be in place prior to passage. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with Home and Commercial Inspections LLC to extend the term of the agreement from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development executed an agreement with Home and Commercial Inspections LLC for radon testing services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the agreement term needs to be extend in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify a contract (PO379816) to extend the agreement term to December 31, 2024, in order to expend all of the funds original appropriated.\n \nSECTION 2: That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
