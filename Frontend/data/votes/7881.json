    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department Development to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board to extend the agreement term from to January 31, 2024, in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated.  The Department of Development’s original intent was for the contract term to expire on January 31, 2024.  This ordinance corrects that error. No additional funds are requested under this contract modification.  The need for the modification is due to a clerical error in the original intended contract termination date.  \n \nOriginal                                          $5,389,650.00                                          Ord. 1764-2023                     PO402626\nMod 1                                          $            0.00\nTotal                                          $5,389,650.00\n \nCommunity Shelter Board has, and will continue, to administer the following five initiatives to address homelessness in our community: Continuum of Care Application, Crisis Response, Outreach Services, Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) Services, and the Safety Net Program. These programs provide support for men, women and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness in Columbus. The Community Shelter Board leads a coordinated, community effort to make sure everyone has a place to call home. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds for this contract are allocated to the Housing Division’s FY2023 General Fund budget.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004795 and is valid from 1/9/2023-1/9/2025.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to facilitate executing the contract modification by the City Auditor and City Attorney by the end of the year deadlines.  The existing contract expires December 31, 2023, so renewal approval as quickly as possible will prevent a lapse in service.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department Development to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board to extend the agreement term to January 31, 2024; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development executed a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board related to five initiatives: Continuum of Care Application, Crisis Response, Outreach Services, Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) Services, and the Safety Net Program (\"Initiatives\"); and\n \nWHEREAS, the original intent was for the contract term to expire on January 31, 2024.  The error is now being remedied.  The agreement term needs to be extended in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development to facilitate executing the contract modification by the City Auditor and City Attorney by the end of the year deadlines.  The existing contract expires December 31, 2023, so renewal approval as quickly as possible will prevent a lapse in service; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify a not-for-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board related to the Initiatives, to extend the agreement term to January 31, 2024, in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
