    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify the present contract with Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc. for additional funds for helicopter maintenance services for the Division of Police; to authorize an expenditure of $254,555.50 from the General Fund  ($254,555.50)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, needs to modify the current contract with Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc., PO393796, which was executed on July 7, 2023.  Said modification will allow for additional funds for helicopter maintenance services for the Division of Police.  Funds were initially encumbered in the amount of $898,666.50 on ordinance No. 1279-2023.  An additional $254,555.50 is needed for services through the remainder of the year and for the months of January and February, 2024 resulting in $1,153,222.00 for the fiscal year of 2023. Ordinance No. 1279-2023 authorized a contract renewal with Helicopter Minit-Men Inc. that covers the contract period of March 1, 2023 to February 29, 2024. \n \nFormal Bid # RFQ015260 was opened on April 9, 2020. Only one response was received and that bid was from Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc. A Formal Bid Section 3.4.8 allows for an option of three (3) one (1) year renewals, making the overall contract length a potential four (4) years. \n \n1. The amount of this modification is $254,555.50.\n2. The total amount was foreseen when the contract was awarded but the Department of Public Safety through the Department of Finance and Management wanted to hold back 25% of the total amount budgeted until after the third quarter review.\n3. It is in the city's best interest to not have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes because only one bidder has bid on this contract for the last few years.\n4. This modification is just needed to add more funds to the contract. Same pricing that was in the original contract will still be honored.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER:  CC004181 is in the process of being updated.\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the modification of the current contract with Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc. for additional funds in the amount of $254,555.50 for continued helicopter maintenance services.  There are funds allocated in the General Fund for these services.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to modify the present contract with Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc. for additional funds for helicopter maintenance services for the Division of Police; to authorize an expenditure of $254,555.50 from the General Fund  ($254,555.50)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, has a need for continued helicopter maintenance services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Safety to modify the current contract with Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc.; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize additional funds in the amount of $254,555.50; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this renewal period will be from November 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024; and NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Safety is hereby authorized to modify the present contract with Helicopter Minit-Men, Inc. to reflect additional funds for continued helicopter maintenance. \n \nSECTION 2.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance and to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City's financial records.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the expenditure of $254,555.50, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in object class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
