    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Civil Service Commission, to enter into an agreement with Governmentjobs.com (also known as NeoGov) for application hosting services in support of the Insight Enterprise applicant and test management software system, Biddle software and candidate text messaging. Utilizing this system, Civil Service can do online job analysis data collection and offsite testing, test management and candidate text messaging, all critical to the Commission’s mission. The original agreement with NeoGov (ED038195) was established March 11, 2009 and was most recently modified with the passage of ordinance 3081-2022, passed on November 21, 2022, in the amount of $91,644.85. The term of this agreement will be for one (1) year, beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024 at a cost of $91,644.85.\n \nThis ordinance also requests approval to continue the above-described services via a waiver of relevant sections of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code relating to competitive bidding.
