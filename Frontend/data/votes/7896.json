The purpose of this legislation is to enable the Department of Public Service to satisfy its administrative and financial obligations related to that effort by authorizing: 1) the execution of a contribution agreement or other instrument, and any amendments or modifications thereto, between the Department of Public Service, acting through its director, and ODOT, and 2) the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $5,000,000.00 to support completion of the project. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of up to $5,000,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service to support the local share of estimated construction costs; however, the final cost to the City may vary based on the results of the competitive bidding process administered by ODOT. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned expenditure.\n \n3.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nODOT is a political subdivision of the State of Ohio.
