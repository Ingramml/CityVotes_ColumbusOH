    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Oracle America, Inc. for licensing and cloud service fees for the Department’s Customer Information Systems (CIS) and Integrated Systems Replacement Project. \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities (DPU) plans to replace its current customer information systems platform, the Columbus Utility Billing System, also known as CUBS. This ordinance authorizes the licensing fees to utilize Oracle’s customer platform, while a request for proposals (RFP) will later be issued for the project’s implementation.\n \nDPU implemented Oracle’s Customer Cloud Service (CCS) for meter data management in 2022 as part of the Department's Enhanced Metering Project (EMP). Numerous custom integrations were created to sync meter data between Oracle’s CCS and Hansen Banner. It is challenging to manage the lifecycle of meters with two separate systems. Since DPU is already using Oracle CCS for meter data management and analyzed the functionality of the Customer Information Systems (CIS) side of Oracle CCS, DPU would like to implement the entire Oracle CCS solution, including Oracle Reporting and Analytics tools. Merging these systems into one platform should reduce system complexity, increase data and billing accuracy and make it easier for us to support the system into the future. In addition, we expect similar benefits with the implementation of Oracle Field Service (OFS) for utilities, which is also developed by Oracle and built to integrate with Oracle CCS. OFS will replace our current Mobile Dispatching System, CGI’s PragmaCAD. Therefore, due to the benefits of merging the systems into one platform, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the provisions of competitive bidding and enter into a contract with Oracle America, Inc. for the customer platform licensing. The Bid Waiver Form is attached. \n \nThe licensing subscription will begin on April 1, 2024 and run through October 19, 2025 to align with the renewal cycle for the Department’s Oracle CCS license.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nOracle America, Inc. | D365 Vendor 010840 | EIN on file | Expires 10/4/2025\nThe vendor does not hold MBE or WBE status\n \nOracle America, Inc. is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \n$250,000.00 was budgeted for the licensing component of the CIS replacement project. The actual amount was unknown at the time of the 2023 budget. The deficit will be supported by canceling or deferring other projects to 2024. \n  \n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n$0.00 was spent in 2021\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Oracle America, Inc. for licensing and cloud service fees for the Department’s Customer Information Systems (CIS) and Integrated Systems Replacement Project; to authorize the expenditure of $1,592,636.40 split among the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds; and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code.
