    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a service contract with Benevate Inc. for the continued use of Neighborly software, including support and training services, in an amount up to $31,200.00 and to authorize the payment of expenses beginning November 1, 2023. \n \nThe Department of Development, Housing Division started using Neighborly software in 2021.  Ordinance 2629-2021 authorized the Director of the Department of Development to waive Columbus City Code Chapter 329 and enter into a contract with Benevate, Inc. for the software.  After a year of use, the Housing Division would like to continue using the software to enable safe and secure intake of applications, facilitate work from any location, and provide prompts to applicants to assure that a complete application is submitted.  \n \nIn October 2021, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 2629-2021 to enter into a contract with Benevate, Inc and waived competitive bidding. \n \nIn December 2022, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 3413-2022 to enter into a contract with Benevate, Inc and waived competitive bidding.  The current contract expires on October 31, 2023.\n \nContract Compliance: The vendor number is 039660 and expires 10/16/2025.\n \nWaiver Request:  A waiver of the competitive procurement requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329.18 is being requested, as Neighborly is the only hosted software currently available for purchase that can address all of the City of Columbus, Department of Development, and Housing Division’s needs in one solution.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $31,200.00 within the Development Department’s General Fund Budget.  \n \nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested in order to permit continued access of this software without interruption.  The existing contract expires at the end of October so renewal approval as quickly as possible will prevent a lapse in service that will prevent both public and private users from accessing and using the platform to submit requests.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Benevate Inc., in an amount up to $31,200.00; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329; to authorize the payment of expenses beginning November 1, 2023, for the use of Neighborly software, support, and training services; to authorize the expenditure of $31,200.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($31,200.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development, Housing Division started using Neighborly software in 2021 and has integrated it into its daily operations; and\n \nWHEREAS, Neighborly is a cloud based software package that will enable safe and secure intake of applications, facilitate work from any location, and provide prompts to applicants to assure that a complete application is submitted; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development request approval to waive the competitive bidding requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329.18, to execute a contract with Benevate Inc. and to request to authorize the reimbursement of expenses beginning November 1, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with Benevate Inc. in order to permit continued access of this essential software without interruption; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to enter into a service contract with Benevate Inc., in an amount up to $31,200.00, and to authorize the payment of expenses beginning November 1, 2023, for the use of Neighborly software, support, and training services.\n \nSECTION 2.  That City Council finds it in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provision of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes to enter into this contract.\n \nSECTION 3.  That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $31,200.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept Div 4410 (Housing), object class 03 (Services) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
