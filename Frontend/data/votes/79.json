    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute a Construction Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement Agreement (the \"Agreement\") relative to the completion of the Roadway - Reach Boulevard & Generations Pass and SR 315 project (the “Project”) with White Castle Management Company in an amount of up to $1,097,806.68.  This ordinance also authorizes the appropriation, transfer, and expenditure of the Project Funding in accordance with the Agreement.\n \nThe aforementioned Project will culminate in the construction of a new public roadway and other public infrastructure improvements, including intersection improvements at West Goodale Street, Reach Boulevard, and S.R. 315, and additional turn lanes to the S.R. 315 exit ramps at that intersection. \n \nPursuant to Ordinance 1602-2017, City Council authorized the City, acting through the Department of Development, to enter into an Economic Development Agreement dated October 26, 2017 (the “EDA”) with White Castle Management Company (“White Castle” or the “Developer”) to memorialize their understanding and agreements with respect to the redevelopment of  the White Castle headquarters, located at 555 W. Goodale Street (the “Project Site”).  Pursuant to the EDA, the City and the Developer agreed to partner on the construction of public infrastructure improvements on and near the Project Site. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nThe contract compliance number for White Castle Management Company is CC029299, which expires September 13, 2021.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe funds necessary to reimburse the Developer will be derived from a recent grant award and TIF proceeds designated for that purpose. Pursuant to Ordinance 3316-2019, the City accepted a $150,000.00 JCED grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation (“ODOT”) for costs associated with the construction of improvements to the SR 315 North exit ramp to Goodale Street. The City previously established the Gowdy Field TIF near the Project Site pursuant to Ordinance 2079-2005 and Ohio Revised Code Section 5709.41, and established the Crosswoods TIF pursuant to Ordinance 1716-2003 and Ohio Revised Code Section 5709.40(B) to use each for public infrastructure improvements. Ohio House Bill 384 and Ordinance 1555-2017 allow revenue from certain TIFs, including the Crosswoods TIF, to be used outside of the designated TIF area. Those funds from the ODOT JCED grant, Gowdy Field TIF, and Crosswoods TIF (the “Project Funding”) have been allocated to reimburse the Developer for eligible construction costs of the Project. \n \nFunding in the amount of $1,097,806.68 is available for this Project as follows:\n•                     $821,013.45 in Fund 4437 (Gowdy Field TIF Debt Fund):  Funds will need to be appropriated, transferred to Fund 7437 Gowdy TIF Capital Projects Fund, and appropriated again to be available for expenditure.\n•                     $126,793.23 in Fund 7419 (Crosswoods TIF Fund):  Funds will need to be appropriated and transferred between projects within Fund 7419.\n•                     $150,000.00 in Fund 7763 (Transportation Grants Fund), Grant G592010, as a reimbursable grant from ODOT.  Funds will need to be appropriated.   \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite reimbursement agreement as soon as reasonably practicable so as to maintain the current project schedule and to meet community commitments.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate funds within the Gowdy TIF, the  Crosswoods TIF, and the Transportation Grants Fund; to authorize the transfer of cash from the Gowdy TIF Debt Service Fund to the Gowdy TIF Capital Projects Fund; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Crosswoods TIF Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a Construction Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement Agreement with White Castle Management Company; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,097,806.68 from the Gowdy TIF,  the Crosswoods TIF, and the Transportation Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.
