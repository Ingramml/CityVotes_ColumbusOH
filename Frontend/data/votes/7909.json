    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a two-year contract with OARnet/OSU, a non-profit organization, for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support services. The original agreement (EL011737) was authorized by ordinance 1716-2010, passed December 13, 2010. The agreement was most recently renewed by authority of ordinance 0887-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on April 26, 2023. The total cost associated with this ordinance is $916,566.52 for the coverage term period from April 2, 2024 to April 1, 2026.\n \nThrough the State of Ohio Virtualization Program, OARnet offers significant discounts on VMWare that are not available in the market place. As such, it is in the city’s best interests to procure VMWare through OARnet, rather than another procurement process. The pricing offered to the city reflects the agreed upon public sector discounts available to all participants in the State of Ohio Virtualization Program. \n \nServer virtualization is the conversion of one physical server into multiple individual and isolated virtual storage spaces. This industry standard was adopted by the DoT in 2009 to reduce the costs of Data Center operations. This also reduces power consumption, cooling requirements, and provides further capabilities for recovery and availability of information systems. VMWare software is the core component that is needed in order to operate virtual servers that run critical applications for the enterprise such as Accela, CUBS, and 311.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the appropriation of $1,170,328.00 to the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, from the unappropriated cash balance of the Information Services Operating fund, pursuant to the projections outlined in DoT’s 3rd quarter 2023 review submission.\n \nAdditionally, this ordinance authorizes various transfers in the Information Services Division’s operating fund. As part of the 2023 third quarter financial review, the Department of Technology and the Department of Finance and Management identified surpluses and deficits in various object classes within the technology services fund.  In order to properly align appropriations with projected expenditures and allow divisions to operate without interruption through the end of 2023, it is necessary to transfer $3,210,538.00 among divisions and object classes within the Information Services operating fund.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $916,566.52 for the above-mentioned purpose.\n \nNOT-FOR-PROFIT CONTRACT INFORMATION\nThis agreement is being awarded under City Code section 329.30, which prescribes the method for contracting with not-for-profit organizations. DoT and OARnet negotiated the cost for provision of the above-described services, the costs for which are outlined in the attachment to this ordinance. The services being authorized herein include VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the above-described services are budgeted and available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor name: OARnet/OSU, 1224 Kinnear Rd Ste. 130, Columbus, OH 43212; DAX Vendor Acct. #: 006163; Expiration Date: Non-Profit Organization (NPO)\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into an agreement with OARnet/OSU for VMWare software licensing, maintenance, and support, pursuant to Columbus City Codes sections relating to not-for-profit service contracts; to authorize the appropriation of $1,170,328.00 to the Department of Technology, Information Services Division from the unappropriated cash balance of the Information Services operating fund; to authorize and direct the City Auditor to transfer $3,210,538.00 in appropriations among divisions and object classes in the Information Services operating fund; to authorize the expenditure of $916,566.52 from the Department of Technology Information Services Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
