    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to modify an existing contract with Brown Enterprises, LLC for upgraded Smartsheet Control Center subscriptions and licenses for various city departments. Smartsheet is used by several city agencies as it is (and can be) used to collaborate on project timelines, documents, calendars, assignments, and related tasks. Smartsheet’s relatively simple user interface centers on \"smartsheets,\" similar to other popular spreadsheets. Additionally, Smartsheet can import data from other applications, such as Microsoft Office or Google.\n \nIn July 2021, DoT received four (4) responses to RFQ019097. Brown Enterprises, LLC submitted the lowest responsive quote and was awarded the contract. The original contract, authorized by Ordinance 1926-2021 and passed on July 19, 2021, contained language allowing for up to three (3) renewals with mutual agreement by all interested parties. Ordinance 2142-2023 authorized the second of the three (3) allowable renewals for a one-year term, beginning on September 1, 2023, and ending on August 31, 2024. Since this ordinance modifies the second renewal and will be co-termed with that contract, this modification will begin on the date of a confirmed purchase order by the City Auditor’s Office and will end on August 31, 2024.\n \nThe need for these additional licenses was not known at the time the original contract was awarded. At that time, city departments were becoming familiar with the functionalities of the Smartsheet application and its usefulness in daily operations. After using it for two-plus years, it has been determined that additional functionality would greatly enhance departmental efficiencies. The total of the requested modification is $53,947.22. DoT wishes to modify the current contract with Brown Enterprises rather than bid it out at this time. Doing so would be disruptive to operations, as Brown holds the current contract. The amount was determined via the submission of a quote from Brown.\n \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $53,947.22 for the above-described purpose.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nIn 2021, ordinance 1926-2021, which passed on July 19, 2021, authorized the original contract at a cost of $71,140.00. First and second renewals were authorized by ordinances 1775-2022 and 2142-2023 in the amounts of $89,875.00 and $158,529.00, respectively. Funds for this modification are available and budgeted in the Information Services operating fund, pending passage of Ordinance 3005-2023, which authorizes a transfer within the Information Services operating fund, reflective of 2023 third quarter review projections.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Brown Enterprises, LLC\nDAX Vendor #: 010668, Expiration Date 12-31-2023\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency designation is requested so that users will have timely access to upgraded Smartsheet functionality needed for various year-end projects.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to modify an existing contract with Brown Enterprises, LLC for upgraded Smartsheet licenses for various city departments; to authorize the expenditure of $53,947.22 for upgraded Smartsheet licenses from the Information Services operating fund; and to declare an emergency.
