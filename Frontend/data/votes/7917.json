($30,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening project.\nOrdinance 2680-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. in an amount of up to $525,000.00 for the Arterial Street Rehabilitation - Cassady Avenue Widening project.  This project consists of improvements to Cassady Avenue from the CSX railroad tracks just north of Delmar Drive to E. 7th Avenue. Cassady Avenue is planned to be widened to a 3-lane section and reconstructed as a complete street with pedestrian and bikeway facilities, lighting, curb and gutter, and closed drainage. The project includes improvements to E. 5th Avenue at the intersection with Cassady Avenue. \n \nOrdinance 0876-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,241,000.00.  This was a planned modification to that contract to support the provision of final design and engineering services needed to construct the proposed improvements.\n \nOrdinance 2068-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $141,000.00.  This was an unplanned modification that was necessary to advance utility coordination with AT&T along the corridor of Cassady Avenue in the project limits to reduce as much as possible the time required for future utility relocations.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $30,000.\n \nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to encumber additional funds for the project.  The original contract scoped insufficient hours for designing the storm control practices, utility and railroad coordination, and right of way coordination that became necessary as part of the project. It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $   522,607.64                     (PO098332, Ord. 2680-2017)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,241,000.00                     (PO223483, Ord. 0876-2020)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $   141,000.00                     (PO338646, Ord. 2068-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 3:                                                                                    $     30,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $1,934,607.64  \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Woolpert, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Woolpert, Inc. is CC001040 and expires 4/17/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $30,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n4.
