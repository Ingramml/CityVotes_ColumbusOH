    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify an existing service contract with Data Ticket, Inc. (Data Ticket) to facilitate the continued operation and maintenance of certain systems currently utilized to support parking enforcement efforts by the Department of Public Service, Division of Mobility & Parking Services.\n \nPursuant to Ordinance 3148-2022, the Department of Public Service, acting through its Director, executed a professional services contract with Data Ticket to oversee the implementation and operation of citation processing and permit management systems intended to streamline and improve on-street parking enforcement. The initial cost to implement and operate those systems for the first year was estimated to be $1,200,000.00. However, due to unexpected cost overruns related to the acquisition and installation of license plate recognition equipment, it is now necessary to encumber additional funding to support the provision of services through the initial contract term. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:                                          $750,000.00\nOriginal contract amount:                                                                                    $1,200,000.00                     (Ord. 3182-2022, PO367125)\nModification 1:                                                                                                                               $   750,000.00                      (This legislation)\nTotal contract amount including all modifications:                               $1,950,000.00\n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nDue to issues impacting the functionality and usability of the license plate recognition equipment initially installed in parking enforcement vehicles, it ultimately was necessary to remove those devices and source different units from an alternate supplier. The final cost to procure and install the new license plate recognition equipment was nearly double the original cost estimate. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt ultimately would have been more cost prohibitive and untimely to initiate a separate competitive procurement process to source the necessary license plate recognition equipment directly from a qualified manufacturer or retailer and to have that vendor make any modifications to those devices that might have been needed to render them compatible with the citation processing and permit management systems developed and operated by Data Ticket.  \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe funding needed to support the proposed contract modification reflects the estimated cost to sustain the continuation of monthly services through at least March 2024 based on the average cost of services in the past 60 days. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Data Ticket, Inc. is CC-042414, which expires July 12, 2024. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $750,000.00 is available within the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund for this expenditure; however, the necessary funds must be appropriated because this is an unplanned expense.   \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite contract modification as soon as reasonably practicable so as to prevent an interruption in services.\nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate funds within the Mobility Enterprise Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify an existing service contract with Data Ticket, Inc. for the provision of off-street parking management services; to authorize the expenditure of up to $750,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($750,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3148-2022 authorized the execution of a service contract between the Department of Public Service and Data Ticket, Inc.

That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approvals by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
