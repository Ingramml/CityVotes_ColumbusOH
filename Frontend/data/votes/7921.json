The existing cinder block retaining wall was identified to be encroaching into the right-of-way while reviewing the construction plans for the project. The cinder block retaining wall is not impacting any functionality of the right-of-way.  Granting these encroachment easements is needed in order for ODOT and the City of Columbus to clear the right-of-way for this project.  The following ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute documents necessary to grant these encroachment easements for the proposed building into the public rights-of-way. \n \nOrdinance 1658-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds for the Operation Safewalks - FRA-SRTS Grace St Sidewalks (3683-E) project.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to grant this Revocable Encroachment Easement.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to complete needed right of way transfers to meet the requirements of the start date for the Ohio Department of Transportation funding award to avoid penalty and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant a Revocable Encroachment Easement to Joseph and Cindy Keaton for a cinder block retaining wall at 81 North Harris Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43204; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a Revocable Encroachment Easement in the public rights-of-way was requested by the owner of the property located at 81 North Harris Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43204; and\n \nWHEREAS, the encroachments include existing cinder block retaining wall; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute those documents necessary to grant encroachment easements to Joseph and Cindy Keaton in order to prevent unnecessary delay to development on the Servient Estate, to ensure the safety of the traveling public thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare;
