The existing block wall are identified to be encroaching into the right-of-way while reviewing the construction plans for the project. The block wall is not impacting any functionality of the right-of-way.  Granting the encroachment easements is needed in order for ODOT and the City of Columbus to clear the right-of-way for this project. \n \nOrdinance 1658-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds for the Operation Safewalks - FRA-SRTS Grace St Sidewalks (3683-E) project.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to grant this Revocable Encroachment Easement.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to complete needed right of way transfers to meet the requirements of the start date for the Ohio Department of Transportation funding award to avoid penalty and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant a Revocable Encroachment Easement to Kristina and Rebecca Alcon, for a block wall at 90 ½ N.
