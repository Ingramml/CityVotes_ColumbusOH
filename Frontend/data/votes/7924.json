    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant revocable encroachment easements to Shawn and Joan Harker, for metal stairs at 107 N Terrace Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43204 (parcel 010-033380).  \n \nThe Department of Public service is engaged in the Operation Safewalks - FRA-SRTS Grace St Sidewalks (3683-E) project.  The purpose of the project is to add compliant sidewalks and improve existing curb ramps along Grace Street from Orel Avenue and to the alley west of Roys Avenue and from Hague Avenue to Eureka Avenue.  A need for sidewalks along this corridor was identified in the School Travel Plan for Columbus City Schools report and in a safety study completed by the Division of Traffic Management in February 2020.  \n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request that the City grant a Revocable Encroachment Easement to allow their metal stairs (0.0001 acres) to remain on City property within existing right-of-way. The existing metal stairs are identified to be encroaching into the right-of-way while reviewing the construction plans for the project. The metal stairs are not impacting any functionality of the right-of-way.  Granting the encroachment easements is needed in order for ODOT and the City of Columbus to clear the right-of-way for this project. \n \nOrdinance 1658-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to submit applications to and execute grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for Highway Safety Improvement Program funds for the Operation Safewalks - FRA-SRTS Grace St Sidewalks (3683-E) project.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to grant this Revocable Encroachment Easement.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to complete needed right of way transfers to meet the requirements of the start date for the Ohio Department of Transportation funding award to avoid penalty and to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant a Revocable Encroachment Easement to Shawn and Joan Harker for metal stairs at 107 N Terrace Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43204; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a Revocable Encroachment Easement in the public rights-of-way was requested by the owner of the property located at 107 N Terrace Avenue Columbus, Ohio 43204; and\n \nWHEREAS, the encroachments include metal stairs encroaching into the right-of-way; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute those documents necessary to grant encroachment easements to Shawn and Joan Harker in order to prevent unnecessary delay to development on the Servient Estate, to ensure the safety of the traveling public thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to execute those documents necessary to grant the following described encroachment easements to Shawn and Joan Harker, and attached exhibits; to-wit:\n \nENCROACHMENT EASEMENT\nFOR EXISTING METAL STEPS\n0.01                     ACRE\n \nSituated in the State of Ohio, Franklin County, City of Columbus, Survey Number 2668, Virginia Military Survey, being in that portion of Grace Street as dedicated to The City of Columbus, Franklin County, Ohio by D.B.
