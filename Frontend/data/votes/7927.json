Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 0200-2023.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Sewerage and Drainage projects include rehabilitation of existing sewers, repair to existing sewers, construction of new sewers, and construction of green infrastructure.  The majority of the projects will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  Other projects provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure to mitigate drainage/flooding issues.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nResource International, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC-004197 and expires 5/31/2025.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  Resource International, Inc. is classified as a WBE company by ODI.  As shown in the Utilization Plan attached to this ordinance, Resource International, Inc. plans to use one sub-consultant on this task.
