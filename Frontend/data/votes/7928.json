BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. for the Electrical Power System Studies project, C.I.P. Number 690574-100000, in an amount up to $350,000.00.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Water (DOW) operates a variety of facilities to obtain, treat, and distribute water to the central Ohio area, including but not limited to dams, collector wells, a raw water pump station, treatment plants, finished water booster stations, and related support/management/administrative facilities.  Under this project, the Consultant shall provide electrical power system study services to enhance worker safety, comply with code requirements, protect equipment, and improve reliability of the electrical distribution system. \n \nThis ordinance will authorize a modification in the amount of $350,000.00 for the following major activities: reviewing existing system information; updating or creating one line diagrams and detailed computerized models of the power systems; collecting field data to support model verification and/or development; performing short circuit studies, device coordination studies, and arc flash risk assessments; developing protective device setting recommendations; and providing arc flash labels for installation on electrical devices.  \n \nWork performed to date for the Electrical Power System Studies project includes the following major activities: reviewing existing system information; updating or creating one line diagrams and detailed computerized models of the power systems; collecting field data to support model verification and/or developments; performing short circuit studies, device coordination studies, and arc flash risk assessments; developing protective device setting recommendations; and providing arc flash labels for installations on electrical devices. \n \nThe Planning Area is “99-Citywide” as tasks will be performed on City projects all over the City.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE\nThe original contract was anticipated to run from 1st QTR 2020 to 1st QTR 2022, but it lasted longer than anticipated because bidding of several of the projects to be served by the contract was delayed.  This modification number 1 is anticipated to fund the contract for an approximately two year period from late 2023 to late 2025.  The authorizing legislation called for two additional/future modifications (#2 and #3).\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $350,000.00\nThe original contract amount was $500,000.00.  There are three programmed modifications of $350,000.00 each.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract (PO208708, Ord. No. 2908-2019)                                                    $500,000.00\nModification #1 (current ordinance)                                                                                                $350,000.00\nModification #2 (future)                                                                                                                            $350,000.00\nModification #3 (future)                                                                                                                            $350,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                              $1,550,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe original professional services agreement was bid out and planned for a total of two contract modifications.  The original agreement was executed in January 2022 to provide funds for approximately a one year period or until all funds are expended.  This is the first modification to add funds.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined by City staff based on the already established contract rates, the cost of task orders issued under the original contract, and the anticipated number/type of tasks to be authorized under modification number 1. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThis project will help the Division of Water renovate/upgrade facilities that are essential components in the Columbus area water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water is essential to economic growth and development.\n \nPublic outreach may occur for some of the projects to be managed under this contract depending on the nature of the work and impacts to the public.\n \n3.
