    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns and Dehaven, dba GPD Group, Inc., for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project, CIP #670868-100001, in an amount not to exceed $750,000.00. \n \nThe Division of Power (DOP) has lost several staff members in recent years.  This General Engineering Services contract has been used to supplement DOP design resources to ensure projects stay on track.  Services to be performed include providing designs to connect new customers, reviewing applications for Joint Use, and designing the work required for the Division to complete in conjunction with the installation of solar on the system by NextEra.  There is also design and analysis work that is required relating to the O’Shaughnessy hydro project to ensure that as the new plant comes online it will interconnect properly. This is work that cannot be provided exclusively by City personnel. \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide. \n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $750,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract                                                           $      750,000.00 (ORD 1369-2022; PO328687)\nRenewal One                                                                $      375,000.00 (ORD 1250-2023; PO390890)\nModification One (current)                                             $      750,000.00 \nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                   $    1,875,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nGPD Group has been providing these services under a contract awarded through the City’s RFP process and expected to end in December of 2025, with planned modifications/renewals to add funding for future years.  Rebidding the contract and using another company would be more expensive as the new company would need to spend time learning and redoing work already performed by GPD Group.\n \n1.3. How the cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis is a contract for needed supplemental engineering for the Division of Power’s various CIP projects, studies required by OSHA and PERRP i.e. Arc Flash Hazard Analysis, and possibly to reduce backlog of DOP’s routine engineering that may arise from unexpected work force reduction and/or greater than normal  workload volume.  As such, it will not have any economic impact, but it will include community outreach if it is used for projects that typically solicit input from the community.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nGPD Group’s contract compliance number is CC-006560 and expires 5/24/2025.  GPD Group’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.  \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  GPD is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the attached Utilization Plan, there is one subcontractor planned to be used on this contract and that subcontractor is certified as an MBE by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is anticipated to be 15%. The subcontractor GPD Group proposes to use for this contract modification is listed below:\nCompany Name                                                        City/State                               ODI Certification Status\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants (AEC)                         Columbus, OH                                                                       MBE\n \nThe certification of GPD Group and AEC were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT  \nFunds are appropriated and available within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303, for this expenditure.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with GPD Group for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Electricity Bond Fund; to expend up to $750,000.00 from the Electricity Bond Fund for the project.  ($750,000.00)  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; and \n \nWHEREAS, Contract PO328387 was authorized by Ordinance 1369-2022 for the Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract modification with GPD is needed to provide funding for the upgrade work that will be performed this year; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget for the purpose of providing sufficient budget authority for the proper project; and \n \nWHEREAS, a transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Electricity Bond Fund is needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds to pay for the contract modification; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change \n6303 / 670897-100000 / Circuit 79 Street Lighting Improvements (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $184,000.00 / $95,675.00 / ($88,325.00)\n \n6303 / 670868-100001 / Power General Engineering Services (2021-2024) (Voted Electricity Carryover) / $1,036,675.00 / $1,125,000.00 / $88,325.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That a transfer of funds between projects within the Electricity Bond, Fund 6303, is authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.
