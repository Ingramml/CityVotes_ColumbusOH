    "description": "Explanation \n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded grant funds from the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO).  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $70,000.00 in grant monies to fund the CDC’s Building Up Infection Prevention & Control in Local Departments in Healthcare-Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance (BUILD HAIAR) Grant Program for the period of October 17, 2023 through June 30, 2024. \n \nHealthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) are infections that patients acquire during the course of receiving healthcare services in hospitals, long-term care facilities, outpatient clinics, and other healthcare settings. HAIs pose a significant threat to patient safety and public health. These infections can cause prolonged hospital stays, increased morbidity and mortality rates, and sizeable financial burdens on healthcare systems. Despite substantial advancements in infection prevention and control practices, HAIs remain a persistent problem. The evolving nature of infectious agents, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, and the complex dynamics within healthcare environments contribute to the ongoing transmission of HAIs. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion in partnership with NACCHO, will provide funding to strengthen local health department’s capacity for healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance prevention and response. \n \nColumbus Public Health will build upon its existing efforts to increase the capacity to improve healthcare infection prevention and response efforts, including COVID-19 and other HAIs, as well as those infections caused by antimicrobial resistant pathogens. This grant will provide training and certification for Long Term Care Infection Prevention for program staff with funding from CDC Grant# 6NU38OT000306-04-01, CFDA# 93.421. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to avoid forfeiture of the grant; to meet the deliverables of the grant; and to increase capacity to improve healthcare infection prevention and response efforts affecting public health and safety;\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The NACCHO Grant Program is entirely funded by the CDC Grant.  This program does not generate any revenue or require a City match.
