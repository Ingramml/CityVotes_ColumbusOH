    "description": "Explanation\n \nResearch shows that women who experience non-fatal strangulation with an intimate partner are seven times more likely to be killed by that partner. On April 4, 2023, Ohio adopted legislation making strangulation of an intimate partner or household member a felony crime (Ohio Senate Bill 288). Charging these high-risk cases as felonies allows the system to hold dangerous offenders accountable while also creating opportunities for victims to understand the seriousness of their situations and link with the resources needed to interrupt cycles of violence--violence interrupters that will save lives.\n \nThe City of Columbus received a United States Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), 2023 Improving Criminal Justice Response (ICJR) program grant. This ordinance accepts and appropriates $800,000 in ICJR funds. This funding enhances and expands justice services and programs implemented through the City of Columbus and Franklin County Blueprint for Safety: Interagency Response to Domestic Violence initiative by creating a Domestic Violence Strangulation Task Force. \n \nThe Strangulation Task Force is a working committee of the Blueprint for Safety team and will focus on effective implementation of Ohio Senate Bill 288. Task force members include city and county prosecutors, detectives, patrol officers, judge(s), advocates and forensic nurses. The group will guide the development of response directives that promote flawless implementation of the law and rock-solid evidence collection, so cases can move forward with or without victim engagement. The group will also bring in experts to train justice processionals on the immediate and lasting impact of strangulation on the brain and body and how to use trauma informed techniques to help victims feel safe, trusted and able to share details of, often horrific, crimes in a supportive/non-triggering manner. \nThrough the three year award period, the group will produce and implement model response directives and training curriculum; present staffing solutions to accommodate increased caseloads for police detectives and prosecutors; and create consistent access to advocacy service for felony victims at municipal court arraignment. Funding will go to the Columbus City Attorney’s Office and the Columbus Division of Police for staffing, training and equipment investments increasing their capacity for sustainable response.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $800,000 in OVW 2023 Improving Criminal Justice Response funding from the United States Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women. This initiative does not generate any revenue nor require a City match.\n \nFederal Grant Program: OVW Fiscal Year 2023 Improving Criminal Justice Response \n§                     Award number: 15JOVW-23-GG-02598-ICJR\n§                     Award amount: $800,000 \n§                     Match requirement: None\n§                     Award period: October 1st, 2023 through September 30th, 2026\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay access to grant funds to cover material purchases and staff expenses required to achieve goals and objectives as outline in the federal grant contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Mayor to accept an $800,000.00 Improving Criminal Justice Response program grant from the United States Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women; to appropriate award funds to the Columbus City Attorney and Columbus Division of Police supporting the work of the inter-agency Domestic Violence Strangulation Task Force and Strangulation Response Team; to authorize the appropriation of $800,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund 2220; and to declare an emergency.
