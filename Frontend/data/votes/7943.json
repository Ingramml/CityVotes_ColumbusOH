    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to purchase one (1) heavy duty tire balancer from the Planet Holding LLC. This machine will be utilized by the Department of Finance Fleet Division for the repair and upkeep of wheels for use throughout the city. RFQ025471 closed on 7/31/2023. There was a total of three (3) bids submitted. After the review of the bids, the lowest bidders (LESWEGO Corp and NAPA) provided bids for a machinery that was not a part of the bid specifications. Therefore, these bidders have been deemed non-responsive. The Fleet Division recommends the award be made to Planet Holdings as their initial bid came out to being the lowest and best bid response to bid specifications, length of warranty and available delivery date: \n \nPlanet Holding - $26,432.00\nLESWEGO Corp - $13,717.28\nNAPA - $8,698.00\n \nPlanet Holding DBA Planet Cellular, ID#22-3919201 vendor#046055\n \nFiscal Impact: A total of $26,432.00 will be spent from the Fleet Management Capital Fund 5205. Amendments to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and transfers of cash within Fund 5205 will be necessary to align budget authority and cash with the proper projects. \n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing machinery to increase in cost as well as limit their availability and produce unacceptably long lead times. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet may ensure the pending purchase and delivery of this machinery.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to purchase one (1) heavy duty tire balancer from Planet Holding LLC; to amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of $26,432.00 within the Fleet Management Capital Fund; to authorize expenditure of $26,432.00 from the Fleet Capital Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($26,432.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Fleet Management Division intends to purchase one (1) heavy duty tire balancer; and \n \nWHEREAS Planet Holding LLC bid was the lowest and best bid response to bid specifications, length of warranty and available delivery date - RFQ025471; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the transfer of $26,432.00 within the Fleet Management Capital Fund 5205; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget Ordinance 1711-2023 in order to provide sufficient budget authority for this and future projects; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Finance and Management Department, Fleet Management Division, in that it is immediately necessary to one (1) heavy duty tire balancer from Planet Holding LLC due to the instability of the automobile supply chain so that the repair and upkeep of tires for the city fleet will be ready as soon as possible, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.
