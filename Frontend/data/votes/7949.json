    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The Department of Development seeks to enter into multiple contracts in an amount totaling up to $925,000.00 for the implementation of the third year of the Accelerate Columbus program targeting small businesses.  \nIn 2019, the City of Columbus launched Accelerate Columbus Small Business as part of a branded set of small business training, technical assistance, mentoring, and advisement programs targeting aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners. Initially offered as a pilot program, the goal of the program was to provide structured as well as on-demand training, one-on-one advisement, and technical assistance to both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs and small businesses.\nDuring the pilot year, the City selected and contracted with two organizations to administer the program on behalf of the City. The consultants administered the program in both classroom and small group settings over two tracts targeting businesses at particular stages of the business lifecycle. Accelerate Columbus: Start-Up and Launch targeted individuals in the exploration, ideation, and pre-revenue business lifecycle stages and Accelerate Columbus: Scale Up and Grow targeted those businesses in a revenue-generating posture and who were uniquely positioned for growth.\nIn 2022, the City selected and contracted with seven organizations to administer the Accelerate Columbus: Scale Up and Grow program on behalf of the City.  These Entrepreneur Support Organizations provided services aimed at increasing the quality of local small business in individual and small group settings.\nBy way of this ordinance, the director seeks to encumber the planned funds from the 2023 operating budget for multiple contracts to administer the third year of the Accelerate Columbus program with to-be-determined firms.  The department is currently engaged in the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, but the process will not be completed before City Council’s last meeting in 2023. It is estimated that the contracts with the selected vendors will be legislated and executed in January 2024.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure continuity of the Accelerate Columbus Program and to utilize the 2023 General Funds in which this program was budgeted.  \n \nFiscal Impact: $875,000.00 is planned and available within the Economic Development Division’s General Fund budget and $50,000.00 is planned and available within the Office of Diversity and Inclusion’s General Fund budget.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to encumber funds for multiple contracts totaling an amount up to $925,000.00 with to-be-determined firms for the implementation of the Accelerate Columbus program targeting small businesses; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $925,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($925,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development seeks to enter into multiple contracts for the implementation of the third year of the Accelerate Columbus program targeting small businesses; and\n \nWHEREAS, the department is currently engaged in  the Request for Proposal process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329, and the process will not be completed, nor legislation ready, before City Council’s last meeting in 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that the Director seeks to encumber the planned funds from the 2023 operating budget for the services mentioned above with to-be-determined firms in an amount up to $925,000.00 in time to meet the City Auditor deadline, thereby preventing disruption of the program, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Development is authorized to encumber the funds for multiple contracts for the implementation of the Accelerate Columbus program targeting small businesses totaling an amount up to $925,000.00 with to-be-determined firms pending the outcome of the Request for Proposal process requirements in Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $875,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 44-02 (Economic Development Division), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the purpose stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $50,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 40-03 (Office of Diversity & Inclusion), in object class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds are hereby deemed appropriated to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That this Council hereby recognizes that this ordinance does not identify specific contractors or vendors for the expenditure purposes authorized herein and hereby delegates sole and final contracting decisions relative to the determination of lowest, responsive, responsible and best bidder(s), per the requirements of City Code Chapter 329, or determination of contracts to be awarded to non-profit organizations, to the Director of Development.\n \nSECTION 7.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
