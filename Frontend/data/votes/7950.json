    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes modifying and increasing two contracts with Vertiv Corporation.  First, the ordinance authorizes modifying and increasing a contract with Vertiv Corporation, for annual maintenance and related services associated with the Department of Technology’s uninterrupted power supply (UPS). Ordinance 0580-2023, which passed on March 13, 2023, authorized, via bid waiver, entering into contract with Vertiv Corporation for the above-noted maintenance services. The term of the contract authorized by Ordinance 0580-2023 was for one year, beginning on April 19, 2023 and ending on April 18, 2024, at a total cost of $89,243.02. It has been determined that additional funds will be needed to undertake UPS maintenance for the balance of the above-noted term. Thus, this ordinance authorizes modifying the UPS contract authorized by Ordinance 0580-2023 by adding $33,093.06 to the original amount. This modification will be co-termed with the contract expiring in April 2024. \nAlthough maintenance services for the UPS systems are available from other suppliers, Vertiv Corporation is the only factory-authorized service provider for the UPS equipment used at the City's data centers. Where alternate providers of UPS services are required to utilize Liebert technicians, Vertiv Corporation's policy is to bill the end user directly and not the third-party service provider; nor does Vertiv Corporation support third-party organizations with technical back-up or guaranteed parts availability. Given the critical need for reliable UPS systems at the city's data centers, it is in the city's best interests to contract directly with Vertiv Corporation. As such, this modification is being submitted with a request to waive relevant portions of Columbus City Codes relating to competitive bidding.\nSecond, this ordinance also authorizes modifying and increasing a contract with Vertiv Corporation for HVAC maintenance and repairs. These services were also most recently authorized by Ordinance 0580-2023. The term of this contract, authorized by Ordinance 0580-2023, was for one year, beginning on April 19, 2023 and ending on April 18, 2024, at a total cost of $74,798.59. This ordinance authorizes adding $35,000 to the existing HVAC maintenance and repair contract. This modification will also be co-termed with the contract expiring in April 2024.  \nThe need for these additional goods and services would not have been foreseen when the original contract was awarded as the amount of and need for repair and maintenance services varies from year-to-year. It would not be feasible to bid this out at this time as the current vendor is familiar with DoT's UPS and HVAC systems and will bill DoT directly, thus not requiring a third-party provider. The named vendor provided DoT with a quote for the above-described services.\nFinally, this ordinance also authorizes the total expenditure of $68,093.06 for the above-noted services.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this ordinance are budgeted and available in the Department of Technology’s Information Services Operating Fund.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVertiv Corporation - #025728, Expiring 10/15/2025\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify and increase an existing contract with Vertiv Corporation for maintenance and related services on the City’s uninterrupted power supply; to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to modify and increase an existing contract with Vertiv Corporation for HVAC maintenance and repairs; to waive the relevant sections of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding; and to authorize the expenditure of $68,093.06 from the Information Services Operating Fund.
