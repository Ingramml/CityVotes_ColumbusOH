    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with Elevate Northland, a non-profit corporation. Recognizing the increase in litter and debris throughout the City of Columbus neighborhoods, it is imperative that we engage Columbus youth as often as possible during our efforts to create a cleaner Columbus.  The focus of Cleaner Columbus is to engage youth groups, including sports teams, cheer squads, scout units, chess clubs, and service, academic, and civic organizations to collect litter and debris at various locations in the Hilltop, Linden, Near East Side, Far East Side, South Side, and Northland neighborhoods during the remainder of 2023 and throughout 2024. Participants will be required to be supervised by a parent or parent-approved adult. Groups will earn a minimum of $500 per area assigned by the City of Columbus up to three times this funding cycle. Elevate Northland will partner with Keep Columbus Beautiful and Cleaner Columbus to pay program groups. \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in providing the resources necessary to create job opportunities for at-risk youth. \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with Elevate Northland to support the Cleaner Columbus Youth Grant Program; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
