    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with XYZ Professional Services, LTD for the Gym Dividers Improvements 2020-2021 Project. The contract amount is $115,882.00, with an allowance of $7,150.00 and a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $133,032.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department has a total of sixteen locations that need room divider systems to accommodate the ability to safely host multiple activities at the same time in their gymnasiums or multipurpose rooms. As a result of this project, the Community Centers and Athletic Complexes involved will be improved to allow them to host several different activities at once in these spaces. The intent is to provide vertical dividers and associated electric motorized devices to lower and raise the room dividers to separate large areas and allow for multiple users to safely use the space, especially during this time of social distancing due to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Five of the locations need in-kind replacement of existing dividers that are in disrepair, one location is in need of a different type of room divider since the existing is no longer manufactured, and the remaining ten facilities have no existing dividers.\n \nThe following locations are part of this project:\n \nIn-Kind Replacement - Gym Dividers:\nBerliner Athletic Complex - 1300 Deckenbach Rd, Columbus, OH 43223\nBig Run Athletic Complex - 4205 Clime Rd, Columbus, OH 43228\nBill McDonald Athletic Complex - 4990 Olentangy River Rd, Columbus, OH 43214\nCleo Dumaree Athletic Complex - 276 S.
