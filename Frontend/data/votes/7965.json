    "description": "Title\nTo formally recognize November 20th as “Transgender Day of Remembrance.”\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Transgender Awareness Week is recognized annually from November 13th through November 19th; and\n \nWHEREAS, following Transgender Awareness Week, Transgender Day of Remembrance is recognized on November 20th; and\n \nWHEREAS, Transgender Day of Remembrance serves as a poignant reminder of the disproportionate violence and discrimination that transgender individuals continue to face; and\n \nWHEREAS, these statistics are often underestimated because violent acts against transgender individuals are unreported and unaddressed due to institutionalized transphobia, racism, and discrimination; and, \n \nWHEREAS, according to the Human Rights Campaign, so far in 2023, there have been over 530 anti-LGBTQIA+ bills introduced in statehouses nationwide; and \n \nWHEREAS, per Columbus City Code Chapter 2331, it is illegal to discriminate against an individual in the areas of employment, housing, or public accommodation based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, familial status, or military status; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nThat this Council does hereby recognize November 20th as “Transgender Day of Remembrance., and that further, this Council recognizes and attends to its duty to dismantle systems of oppression as they persist and is committed to creating a community where residents feel safe, respected, and celebrated.",
