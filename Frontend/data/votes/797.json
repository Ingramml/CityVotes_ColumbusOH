    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with M&D Blacktop for the 2021 CDBG Hard Surface Improvements Project. The contract amount is $148,940.80, with a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $158,940.80 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nEach year, the Recreation and Parks Department allocates a portion of their Capital Improvements Budget for improvements to existing hard surfaces and the installation of new hard surfaces. This work includes improvements to asphalt, concrete, and sports courts. Additional hard surface projects will be constructed in 2021 due to CDBG funds being available for park improvements. This particular contract focuses on the removal and replacement of existing hard surfaces within CDBG neighborhoods. Millbrook Park will have improvements to two sports courts and a parking lot performed. Kobacher Park will have improvements to a sports court and nearby fence constructed. Sullivant Gardens will receive improvements to a sports court as well as an adjacent parking lot and alleyway. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on February 26, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 18, 2021. This project was also picked up by various local and regional plan rooms and distributed to their membership. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nM&D Blacktop (MAJ): $148,940.80\n                     \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that M&D Blacktop was the sole lowest and most responsive bidder.
