    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Resource International, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Vision Zero ‐ Ped Safety ‐ Crosswalk Enhancements 2023.\nOrdinance 1027-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Resource International, Inc. for the Vision Zero ‐ Ped Safety ‐ Crosswalk Enhancements 2023 project. The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources for the design of enhanced crosswalks at 13 locations throughout City.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $150,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $150,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $600,000.00     (PO383247, Ord. 1027-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $150,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $750,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is an unplanned modification that is necessary to cover work for all thirteen locations.  Originally, it was intended to reduce the number of locations but it was decided after receiving cost proposals that doing all locations at once would be more cost efficient. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt is more cost effective and timely to complete all thirteen locations as part of one design contract.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by an internal review of the work proposed and the suggested hours proposed by the consultant. The fee is based on an appropriate estimate of the hours determined to be required for the proposed tasks.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Resource International, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Resource International, Inc. is CC004197 and expires 01/31/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \n4.
