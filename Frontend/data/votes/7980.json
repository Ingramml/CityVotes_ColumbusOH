    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) establish a reasonable and safe prima facie speed limit on Harlem Road from Central College Road to Walnut Street.\n \nAn engineering study conducted along Harlem Road by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 supports decreasing the speed limit from 50 miles per hour to 45 miles per hour on Harlem Road from Central College Road to Walnut Street.  The Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, reached the same conclusion after conducting its own investigation.\n \nThe Franklin County Board of Commissioners recently passed a resolution requesting ODOT to investigate and determine a safe speed limit at this location. It is now necessary for the City of Columbus to enact similar legislation because a portion of Harlem Road lies within City limits.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to the City as a consequence of the passage of this legislation.\n \n3. Emergency Designation\nEmergency action is requested in the interest of public safety so as to allow the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to formally submit the results of its study to ODOT for review and approval as soon as reasonably practicable to ensure and enhance the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation establish a reasonable and safe prima facie speed on Harlem Road from Central College Road to Walnut Street; to repeal any and all speed limit ordinances and resolutions on said roadway; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the current prima facie speed limit on Harlem Road from Central College Road to Walnut Street is 50 miles per hour; and\n \nWHEREAS, an engineering study conducted by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office determined that a speed limit reduction would be appropriate at the aforementioned location; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 provides for the establishment of a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit under such conditions by ordinance enacted by a local authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, reached the same conclusion after conducting its own investigation; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 provides for the establishment of a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit by the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation upon request from a local authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Franklin County Board of Commissioners recently passed a resolution requesting ODOT investigate and determine a safe speed limit at the aforementioned location; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary for the City of Columbus to enact similar legislation because a portion of Harlem Road lies within City limits; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize this legislation in the interest of public safety so as to allow the Franklin County Engineer’s Office to formally submit the results of its study to ODOT for review and approval as soon as reasonably practicable to ensure and enhance the safety of the traveling public, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; and now therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation determine and declare, based upon the recommendation of the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, that the prima facie speed limit be lowered to 45 miles per hour on Harlem Road from Central College Road to Walnut Street on the basis of traffic engineering studies and investigations conducted under the direction of professional engineers.\n \nSECTION 2. That any and all previous speed limit ordinances and resolutions on Harlem Road from Central College Road to Walnut Street, be and are hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after it passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
