    "description": "Explanation\n1. Background\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) establish a reasonable and safe speed limit within the Columbus corporation limits on SR 315 at the Interstate 270 interchange area.\n \nODOT has withdrawn the previous speed limit revision of 40 miles per hour in the vicinity of the SR 315 at Interstate 270 interchange area in order to provide a safe transition of speeds between the freeway and two-lane arterial sections of SR 315.  This speed transition area will allow drivers to reduce speed from 65 miles per hour on the freeway to 40 miles per hour on the two-lane section of SR 315. Part of this safe speed transition area lies within City limits. Therefore, it is now essential for the City of Columbus to enact legislation.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no fiscal impact to the City as a consequence of the passage of this legislation.\n \n3. Emergency Designation\nEmergency action is requested in the interest of public safety so as to allow consistent speed limit signage to be installed within the SR 315 at Interstate 270 interchange area  as reasonably practicable to ensure and enhance the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation establish a reasonable and safe prima facie speed on SR 315 within the Columbus corporation limits north of Interstate 270; to repeal any and all speed limit ordinances and resolutions on said roadway; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the current prima facie speed limit on SR 315 within the Columbus corporation limit north of Interstate 270 is 40 miles per hour; and\n \nWHEREAS, an engineering study conducted along SR 315 in conjunction with ODOT District 6, in accordance with Ohio Revised Code 4511.21, determined that a speed limit of 55 miles per hour would be appropriate for safe transition of speeds between the freeway and two-lane arterial sections at the aforementioned location; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 provides for the establishment of a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit under such conditions by ordinance enacted by a local authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, reached the same conclusion after conducting its own investigation; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.21 provides for the establishment of a reasonable and safe prima-facie speed limit by the Director of ODOT upon request from a local authority; and\n \nWHEREAS, ODOT has withdrawn the previous speed limit revision of 40 miles per hour at the aforementioned location; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary for the City of Columbus to enact legislation because a portion of SR 315 lies within City limits; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize this legislation in the interest of public safety so as to allow installation of consistent speed limit signage as reasonably practicable to ensure and enhance the safety of the traveling public, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to request that the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation determine and declare, based upon the recommendation of the Department of Public Service, Division of Traffic Management, that the current prima facie speed limit be modified to 55 miles per hour on SR 315 from the Columbus corporation limit north of Hard Road to the Columbus corporation limit immediately north of the intersection of SR 315 and Mason Place on the basis of traffic engineering studies and investigations conducted under the direction of professional engineers.\n \nSECTION 2. That any and all previous speed limit ordinances and resolutions on SR 315 within the Columbus corporation limit north of the Interstate 270 interchange be and are hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after it passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
