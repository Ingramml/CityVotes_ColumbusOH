    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: \nThis legislation authorizes the transfer of appropriation from the Department of Neighborhoods General Fund object class 01 to 03 and for the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, on behalf of the City, to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Neighborhood Design Center (NDC), a corporation for non-profit, for housing and retail marketing studies for the Eastland, One Linden, and Envision Hilltop community planning areas.\nHousing and retail market studies are important to gain an overall understanding of current market conditions for the Eastland, One Linden, and Envision Hilltop areas. NDC will develop a housing and retail market study for the Eastland community plan and will update the housing and retail market study data and other data that was included in the original community plans. One Linden and Envision Hilltop data is more than five years old and post pandemic we know that the needs have changed and we need to assess current community conditions.\nThis ordinance repeals and replaces Ordinance 3505-2022 passed on December 14, 2022. The prior ordinance expired May 31, 2023.\nThis support is in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 that relate to not-for-profit service contracts. The services included in this agreement cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\nFiscal Impact: The fiscal impact associated with the execution of the contract is in the amount of $300,000.00 and is to come from Fund 1000 General Fund (GF).\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to avoid any further delay to complete the studies. The studies are required for the development of the Eastland community plan that is currently underway. Emergency action will prevent any further delay to the implementation of the One Linden and Envision Hilltop community plans.\nTitle\nTo repeal and replace Ordinance 3505-2022; to authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Neighborhood Design Center to update the housing and retail study numbers and overall understanding of current market conditions for existing community plans and to develop housing and retail market studies for the Eastland planning area; to authorize the transfer, appropriation and expenditure in the amount of $300,000.00 within the Department of Neighborhoods 2023 General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
