    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into two Indefinite Quantity Contracts with Ironsite, Inc. and Watershed Organic Lawn Care LLC for services associated with the Green Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance Project. The City of Columbus is committed to investing in green infrastructure. As part of this commitment, the City has built a number of bio-retention basins in the right-of-way and/or on City owned property.    \n \nA bioretention basin consists of a soil bed planted with vegetation located above a gravel layer with an underdrain. Stormwater runoff entering the bioretention facility is filtered first through the vegetation and then the soil bed before being conveyed downstream through the underdrain system, slowing the runoff velocity and treating stormwater runoff by absorption, decomposition, and filtration. Bioretention facilities are often sited adjacent to and used to treat runoff from paved surfaces such as parking lots. Bioretention basins improve water quality through: soil and media filtration, stormwater detention, natural evapotranspiration, and biological uptake of water and nutrients. Stormwater can be conveyed to bioretention facilities via sheet flow, channelization, curb cuts, inlets, or conveyance systems.\n \nThe City is currently responsible for the maintenance of 62 Facilities with 1,061 basins and wetlands. These facilities are located in Clintonville, Linden, Eastmoor, American Addition, Southwest Columbus, Blacklick, Hilltop, the South Side, Dublin, Reynoldsburg, Easton, Barthman Parsons, West Town Street/US 62, 2nd Street, River South Roadways West Rich Street, West Main Street Riversouth, West Broad St. at Starling Street, Hoover Reservoir, 910 Dublin Road, Dublin Road Water Plant, Griggs Reservoir, O’Shaughnessy Reservoir, Mound Street Booster Station and the Smoky Row Booster Station. Each facility and location may have multiple sites with basins, swales or other types of green infrastructure. Additional facilities may be added in the future.\n \nIronsite, Inc. and Watershed Organic Lawn Care LLC will coordinate with Stormwater and Regulatory Management Section (SRMS) staff when performing inspection and maintenance at the basins.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities publicly advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with Section 329 of Columbus City Code (RFQ025742). Thirty-one (31) vendors (1-EBE/WBE, 26-MAJ, 3-MBE, 1-WBE) were solicited and two (1-EBE/WBE and 1 MAJ) bids were received and opened on September 13, 2023. \n \nAfter a review of the bids, the Department of Public Utilities recommends awarding contracts to Ironsite, Inc. for Group 1 and Watershed Organic Lawn Care LLC for Groups 2 and 3 as the lowest responsive, responsible and best bidders.\n \nThe contracts will be for a period of one (1) year from the date of execution up to and including November 30, 2024. The contract language allows for the option to renew annually for two (2) additional years based on mutual agreement, availability of budgeted funds and approval by City Council. Future modifications will be required to incorporate additional green infrastructures into this contract as facilities are constructed and turned over to the City for maintenance.  \n \nAt this time, there is knowledge of several other basins coming online over the next several years with increased participation in Blueprint Columbus. The Division of Water and the Division of Transportation have added several sites to this contract and may add additional sites in the near future. All Transportation projects that have storm sewer features such as bio-basins will be maintained by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSUPPLIERS:  \nIronsite, Inc., vendor #005926, EBE/WBE status, expires 7/16/25 \nWatershed Organic Lawn Care LLC, vendor #005742, majority status, expires 3/31/25\n \nThe companies are not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $283,000.00 is budgeted and needed for this purchase.
