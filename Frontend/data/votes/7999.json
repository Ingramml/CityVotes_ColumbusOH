    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify to extend the term of the agreement from December 31, 2023 until December 31, 2024, with ATC Group Services LLC, to continue to provide lead risk assessments and lead clearance to sustain lead-safe housing.  \n \nOriginal                                          $  45,000.00                     PO209523\nMod 1                                          $            .00                      Ord. 0466-2020  PO222097\nMod 2                                          $  50,000.00                     Ord. 0759-2022  PO320741\nMod 3                                          $  90,000.00                     Ord. 2863-2022  PO359917\nMod 4                                                                .00                     \nTotal                                          $185,000.00\n \nThe Lead Safe Columbus Program works to identify lead based paint hazards in homes built before 1978 within the City of Columbus prioritizing families with children under the age of six (6) years old living in the home. In order to identify and abatet those lead based paint hazards we need to work with licensed risk assessors. The licensed risk assessors complete a full lead based paint risk assessment using a specialized XRF gun to determine where lead based paint hazards are and if they are in a condition to need repair. The licensed risk assessors are responsible for creating the work specifications that determine which lead based paint hazards should be addressed and what abatement method to use. Once the work is completed by a licensed lead abatement contractor the licensed risk assessors’ returns to the property to complete a dust wipe sampling to ensure that all hazards have been properly abated and cleaned. Once the samples are collected and sent for testing and determined to be cleared the licensed risk assessor will give a clearance followed by a clearance report that is provided to the homeowners stating all the hazards were abated and cleared during the time of the clearance testing and methods on how to maintain the abatement methods.\n \nThis modification will extend the term of the contract to continue to provide assessment and clearance services as authorized per the Lead Hazard Reduction Grant through December 31, 2024. \n \nEmergency action is needed to assure that services are continued to be provided and that the term of the contract will align with the grant period. This modification is also needed as an emergency to assure that it is fully executed prior to the City financial system being closed for year-end processing. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is necessary.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 008456 and expires 9/19/2024.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with ATC Group Services LLC to extend the term of the agreement from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development executed an agreement with ATC Group Services LLC for assessment and clearance services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, the agreement term needs to be extended in order to expend all of the funds originally appropriated; and \n \nWHEREAS,  an emergency exist in the usual and daily operation of the Department of Development to modify the contract to assure that services are continued to be provided so that the term of the contract will align with the grant period.
