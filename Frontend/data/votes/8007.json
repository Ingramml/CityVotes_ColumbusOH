($82,000.00)",
    "description": "Need:  This ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice (ForPsych) for psychological screening of public safety recruits for upcoming classes at the Police and Fire Academies.\n \nThe Civil Service Commission needs to request authority to modify and increase our current contract maximum authorized expenditure with ForPsych in order to add funds for upcoming psychological screening services.  The modification and increase is necessary now because funding is typically added annually or prior to a scheduled academy class based upon available academy positions identified as the year progresses, to avoid encumbering City funds prematurely or unnecessarily. For this third modification in 2023, we are requesting an increase of $82,000.00 to the current $445,000.00, previously authorized, for a new total contract appropriation of $527,000.00.\n \nSince this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process (see below), the contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes.  Pricing for the additional assessments is in accordance with bid pricing previously submitted by ForPsych for 2022-24 services.\n \nBid Information:  The City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ 019812) for these services and accepted proposals through October 8, 2021.  Three proposals were received by the deadline. An evaluation committee reviewed all proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP which included quality and feasibility of proposals, cost, competence, ability, past performance, and timeliness of reporting results.  Based upon the committee’s review and ranking of the submitted proposals, it was determined that ForPsych was the best and most responsive bidder for the required services.  Therefore, the Commission awarded the contract to ForPsych for the psychological assessment services beginning January 1, 2022.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested in order to increase the contract immediately so that needed assessment services can be funded and completed for police and fire academy classes scheduled for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.\n \nContract Compliance Number:  CC-033463, expires 10/18/2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these services was budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2023 General Fund budget. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the current contract with ForPsych for the psychological screening of public safety recruits; and to authorize the expenditure of $82,000.00 from the General Fund, for a total 2023 appropriation of $82,000.00; and to declare an emergency. ($82,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2021, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for psychological screening services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded a contract to ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice based upon the submissions of RFQ019812; and,\n \nWHEREAS, in December 2022, Three Hundred Twenty Thousand dollars ($320,000.00) had been authorized to ForPsych for the provision of psychological screening services in 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, the current contract is potentially insufficient to pay for upcoming services needed to fill remaining 2023 and first quarter 2024 academy positions and it is therefore now necessary to modify and increase the value of the current contract with ForPsych; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to increase the contract with ForPsych in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be, and is hereby, authorized to modify and increase the current contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the purpose of administering additional psychological screenings to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2.  That, upon passage of Ordinance 3148-2023, the additional expenditure of $82,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
