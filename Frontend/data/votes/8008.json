    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend an agreement, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with Energility, LLC, for architectural/engineering services related to Phase 2B of the Energy Assessment Retro-Commissioning Study & Professional Services Project, in an amount up to $40,000.00.\n \nThis is a multi-phased project.  \n \nThe original contract (PO177659) was established under Ordinance No. 3315-2018 for Phase 1 services which allowed Energility to conduct energy audits to find energy efficiency and retro-commissioning opportunities and develop a retro-commissioning scope.\n \nModification No. 1 (PO254159) was authorized under Ordinance No. 2729-2020, for Phase 2A Services - technical support during implementation.\n \nModification No. 2 (PO335910) was authorized under Ordinance No. 1441-2022, for Phase 2B Services - technical support for implementation of lighting, window film, & additional HVAC/controls scope.\n \nModification No. 3 (PO395512) was authorized under Ordinance No. 1493-2023, for Phase 2B to continue technical support services.  The intended scope is to add Trane Direct Digital building automation controls to the East Central Health building to replace the system that is obsolete and no longer functional.  \n \nModification No. 4 (current) will provide preparation, fieldwork, project management, and commissioning services for the addition to the design of the Jerry Hammond building automation and HVAC project.\n \nThe scope of work includes fieldwork to confirm the location and operational status of 115 mixing boxes.  Some boxes have likely been abandoned when replaced by another dedicated system, most likely in the DoT area.  Energility will verify the location of corresponding electric panels with space for adding in the control power for each of the mixing boxes’ new HVAC controls.  Additionally, Energility will prepare location drawings for the mixing boxes and electric panels for bidders to use.  Also added is the design for air handler floor insulation and the return air-flow study to identify the cause of the blockage causing the building negative pressure.  This is the final piece of recommended HVAC control work needed to improve the energy efficiency of the Jerry Hammond building as recommended by the ASHRAE Level 2 energy audit and subsequent findings during the ongoing HVAC & control retro-commissioning at this site.  \n \nThe contract was extended through July 19, 2024 under Modification No. 3 and remains unchanged.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $40,000.00\nOriginal Purchase Order Amount:                     $  89,096.00  (PO177659)\nModification No. 1:                     $  42,330.00  (PO254159)\nModification No. 2:                     $  40,000.00  (PO335910)\nModification No. 3:                     $    8,500.00  (PO39512)\nModification No. 4: (current):                     $  40,000.00\nTotal (Original and Mods):                     $219,926.00\n \n1.2. Reasons additional services could not be foreseen:  The extent of technical support required could not fully be identified prior to conducting detailed audits and analysis.                                                      \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  Work under this project has been in process for four years and would be inefficient to initiate a new procurement process.  \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:  A quote provided by Energility was reviewed and deemed acceptable by the City’s energy manager.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO: DAX No. 28992, expires 4/23/24, Majority\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Energility, LLC.\n \n3. MINORITY PARTICIPATION:  Energility, LLC did not propose any minority designated subcontractors at this time.  \n \n4. FISCAL IMPACT:  There are sufficient funds and budgetary authority within the Construction Management Capital Improvements Fund - Fund No. 7733 for this expenditure.     \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and extend the professional services agreement with Energility, LLC to provide architectural/engineering services for Phase 2B of the Energy Assessment Retro-Commissioning Study & Professional Services Project; and to authorize an expenditure up to $40,000.00 within the Construction Management Capital Improvements Fund.  ($40,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, entered into a professional architecture/engineering services agreement, with Energility, LLC for the Energy Assessment Retro-Commissioning Study & Professional Services Project, established under contract number PO177659, authorized by Ordinance No. 3315-2018, and approved by City Council on December 13, 2018; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 1 for Phase 2A services was established under contract number PO254159, authorized by Ordinance No. 2729-2020, and approved by City Council on December 7, 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 2 for Phase 2B services was established under contract number PO335910, authorized under Ordinance No. 1441-2022, and approved by City Council on June 13, 2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 3 Phase 2B services was established under contract number PO395512, authorized under Ordinance No. 1493-2023, and approved by City Council on July 13, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 3 also extended the agreement through July 19, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, Modification No. 4 (current) will provide consultation related to oversight of the implementation of the building automation system for the Jerry Hammond Center; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract termination date remains July 19, 2024 as designated under Modification No. 3; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize an expenditure of funds within the Construction Management Capital Improvements Fund - Fund No. 7733; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management, Office of Construction Management, to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify and extend the professional services agreement with Energility, LLC to provide architectural/engineering services for Phase 2B of the Energy Assessment Retro-Commissioning Study & Professional Services Project; for the preservation of the public safety, peace, property and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify and extend the professional services agreement, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, with Energility, LLC, to provide architectural/engineering services for Phase 2B of the Energy Assessment Retro-Commissioning Study & Professional Services Project, in an amount up to $40,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2.  That an expenditure of $40,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in the Construction Management Capital Improvements Fund - Fund No. 7733, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.  \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this Ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project account by monies from more than one source.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this Ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
