    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute a contract modification with LAZ Parking Midwest, LLC dba LAZ KARP Associates, LLC (LAZ) to facilitate the continued provision of off-street parking management services at City-owned off-street parking facilities. \n \nPursuant to Ordinance 3148-2021, the Director of Public Service executed a professional services contract with LAZ for the provision of off-street parking management services.   \n \nOrdinance 2360-2022 authorized the execution of a contract modification between the parties for the purposes of expanding the scope of services to include the surface lot located at 151 N. Garfield Avenue, extending the original contract term through April 30, 2025, and authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funding to provide for services through the end of 2022. \n \nOrdinance 0979-2023 authorized the execution of second contraction between the parties for the purpose of authorizing the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funding to provide for services through the spring of 2024. However, the Department anticipates there will be a shortfall in available operational funding appropriated to support said services, necessitating the execution of a third contract modification.     \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:                                          $1,000,000.00\nOriginal contract amount:                                                                                    $   949,144.63                      (Ord. 3148-2021, PO339839)\nModification 1:                                                                                                                               $   500,000.00                      (Ord. 2360-2022, PO364277)\nModification 2:                                                                                                                               $1,600,000.00                      (Ord. 0979-2023, PO384560)\nModification 3:                                                                                                                              $1,000,000.00    (This legislation)\nTotal contract amount including all modifications:                               $4,049,144.63\n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThere has been an increase in the patronage of City-owned off-street parking facilities in recent months, as well as the addition of management of the new Astor Park garage, resulting in additional operational costs. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt is unlikely that seeking out and engaging another off-street parking services provider would result in significant cost savings for the City.   \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe funding needed to support the proposed contract modification was calculated based on a cost audit for the preceding 6 months with the anticipated financial impacts and the official opening of another City-owned parking garage to the public early next year. The additional funding is intended to support the provision of services through at least the second quarter of 2024 if not longer. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for LAZ KARP Associates, LLC is CC025564 and expires January 5, 2025. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,000,000.00 is available within the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund for this expenditure.   \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThe City of Columbus MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements are not applicable because the original Off-Street Parking Management contract was put in place prior to the implementation of this program. \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to facilitate the execution of the requisite contract modification as soon as reasonably practicable so as to prevent an interruption in services due to a shortfall in available operational funding.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to modify an existing service contract with LAZ Parking Midwest, LLC dba LAZ KARP Associates, LLC (LAZ) provision of off-street parking management services; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,000,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
