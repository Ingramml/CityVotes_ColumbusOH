    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The City of Columbus receives annual grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The City’s HUD 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan combines into a single submission the planning and application aspects of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs, and represents the City’s commitment to delivering these programs over the five-year period.\n \nEach year, the City of Columbus, Department of Finance and Management, Grants Management Section is responsible for completing and submitting Annual Action Plans to HUD. Annual Action Plans identify projects and establish budgets for the City’s HUD grant programs, and summarize annual efforts for consultation, citizen participation, and anticipated outcomes.  HUD has not announced the 2024 grant allocations therefore this legislation contains a Draft FY 2024 Annual Action Plan Summary with estimated funding amounts based on historic figures. The final plan will be adjusted to match the actual allocations upon receipt of notices of awards. The Fiscal Year 2024 allocations are expected to be announced in spring 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The City expects to receive approximately $15 million in grant awards for the four programs listed above. This legislation authorizes the Mayor to accept those grant awards and enter into grant agreements with HUD. City Departments managing these awards will submit future legislation to authorize both the appropriation and expenditure of those funds.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to adopt the Draft FY 2024 Annual Action Plan, authorize the acceptance of 2024 HUD Community Planning and Development grant awards, and authorize the filing of the final FY 2024 Annual Action Plan with HUD so that the Department of Finance and Management can appropriate funds, execute agreements, and complete other necessary steps prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year on January 1, 2024 to comply with federal requirements, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety.\n \nTitle\n \nTo adopt the Draft FY 2024 Annual Action Plan which implements the fifth year of the five-year Consolidated Plan for the CDBG, HOME, ESG and HOPWA programs; to authorize the acceptance of 2024 HUD Community Planning and Development grant awards; to authorize the filing of the final FY 2024 Annual Action Plan with the U.
