    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Department of Finance and Management, Grants Management Section anticipates an annual entitlement funding award for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  This ordinance is needed to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of a portion of the CDBG award in order to post timely financial transactions for grant-funded programs.  There will be subsequent ordinances submitted to appropriate the remaining grant funds, and authorize additional agreements and expenditures for various CDBG activities.\n \nThe Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program provides annual grants on a formula basis to cities and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low-and moderate-income persons.  All City CDBG expenditures must be consistent with the community needs, priorities, and strategies stated in the City’s 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan, as approved by HUD. \n \nThe appropriations requested in this ordinance align with the Draft FY 2024 Annual Action Plan and are contingent on approval of the Draft FY 2024 Annual Action Plan through Ordinance #2993-2023. Listed below are the programs and Subrecipient Agreements funded by the actions outlined in this Ordinance.\n \nDepartment of Finance and Management - Grants Management Administration - $800,000.00\nThe Legal Aid Society of Columbus - Fair Housing Services Program - $200,000.00\nHabitat for Humanity MidOhio - Roof Replacement Program - $200,000\nThe Refuge, Inc. - Recovery Housing Repair and Refurbishment - $100,000\nSanctuary Collective dba Sanctuary Night - Expanding Capacity - $100,000\nCommunity Development for All People - Healthy Eating and Living (HEAL) Program - $85,000\nHelping Hands Health and Wellness Center, Inc. - Free Care Program - $50,000\nSt. Stephen's Community Homes Limited Partnership - HVAC Replacement - $238,676\nBridgeway Academy - HVAC Upgrades - $575,074\n \nThis Ordinance will also authorize Subrecipient Agreements, but will not appropriate funds at this time for the following projects: \n \nRickenbacker Woods Foundation - Genesis Project \nDirections for Youth and Families, Inc. - Ohio Avenue Youth Center\nThe Gladden Community House - HVAC Replacement\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The CDBG program is primarily funded with entitlement awards by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  However, certain grant programs may generate revenue that must be spent on furthering CDBG programming as required by the grantor. The anticipated FY 2024 entitlement award is estimated at $7,600,000.00.  This ordinance will authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $2,348,750.00 (Fund 2248).\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of these funds and authorize these Subrecipient Agreements so that the Department of Finance and Management can prepare and execute Subrecipient Agreements and complete other necessary steps prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year on January 1, 2024 to comply with federal requirements, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Finance and Management to appropriate and authorize the expenditure of $2,348,750.00 in CDBG grant funds (Fund 2248) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter in Subrecipient Agreements with community-based partners to undertake eligible activities; and to declare an emergency.
