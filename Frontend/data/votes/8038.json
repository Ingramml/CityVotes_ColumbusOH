    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Historical Society dba COSI (Center of Science and Industry).\n \nCOSI is a critical community partner, including supporting Columbus residents of all ages and backgrounds in their educational journey. This includes key programming for the Columbus community, like the COSI Color of Science program, the annual COSI Science Festival, Learning Lunchbox STEM kits, Dr. B in 3, and the PLATFORM. Additionally, onsite experiences in the city-owned building, including fieldtrips for Title 1 schools, little kidspace for early childhood education, educational programs for those with special-needs, and more, ensure COSI is accessible to learners of all backgrounds. This funding will ensure the building remains physically accessible to all learners.\n \nThe funding from the City will be used by COSI for upgrading and improving its elevator systems. These upgrades ensure that every corner of the building remains accessible to all guests. COSI’s elevator systems required updates to maintain safety standards. The modernized elevators take full advantage of recent elevator system upgrades, ensuring their elevators are able to provide safe, reliable mobility options to COSI’s more than 700,000 guests annually.\n \nAccessibility is core to the work of COSI - from free community programs like the COSI Science Festival and the hundreds of thousands of Learning Lunchboxes distributed throughout the state to steeply discounted admission to the building through the Museums for All program. Elevator modernization represents a critical link in ensuring the building remains accessible and welcoming to all. Aging elevator mechanicals threaten that access, causing more frequent and prolonged downtime that can force guests to travel to another section of the 320,000 square foot building for an elevator. Additionally, many of the parts used in current elevators are no longer made, resulting in increased cost and time to repair when parts break.\n \nCOSI’s elevator modernization program will update and replace key components of all building elevators, including: Upgrading to solid-state controllers, which have smoother starts and reduced wear; Replacing door assemblies, including doors, door operator motors, tracks, and hangers; Installation of an infrared door protection system to ensure doors do not close on objects or passengers; New fixtures, which includes operator buttons and current floor indicators; Power units, resulting in quieter operation and preventing entrapment with power loss; New cab interiors, creating a more pleasant rider experience; and renovations to elevator mechanical rooms to ensure they are brought up to current Building Code requirements.\n \nThe total cost of the elevator upgrade project is $1,170,166.00.\n \nFranklin County Historical Society DBA COSI, FID: 314383802. CC# CC-006091, expires on 5/14/24.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Recreation & Parks Taxable Bonds Fund. A transfer of appropriation is necessary to establish sufficient authority within the proper Department. COSI will utilize city funding of $1,000,000 to support the upgrades to COSI elevator systems to help improve accessibility and engagement.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer appropriation within the Recreation & Parks Taxable Bonds Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Historical Society dba COSI; to authorize the expenditure of $1,000,000.00 from the Recreation & Parks Taxable Bonds Fund; and to allow for expenditures prior to the Purchase Order ($1,000,000.00)\n \n \nBody \n \nWHEREAS, COSI is a critical community partner, including supporting Columbus residents of all ages and backgrounds in their educational journey; and\n \nWHEREAS, accessibility is core to the work of COSI - from free community programs like the COSI Science Festival and the hundreds of thousands of Learning Lunchboxes distributed throughout the state to steeply discounted admission to the building through the Museums for All program; and\n \nWHEREAS, over decades, the building’s elevator systems have become outdated with many of the parts and components used in current elevators are no longer made, resulting in increased cost and down time to repair when systems malfunction or break; and\n \nWHEREAS, COSI’s elevator modernization program will update and replace key components of all building elevators and City of Columbus funding will be used to support this overall program; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with the Franklin County Historical Society dba COSI for elevator modernization work at the facility to maintain and increase accessibility for visitors, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
