    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an increase in Stormwater charges effective January 1, 2024 and to amend Chapter 1149 of the Columbus City Codes. \n \nThe stormwater charges per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) will increase from $5.16 to $5.21 per month for a typical Inside City residential customer, or from $.1687 per day per ERU to $.1704 per day per ERU. \n \nRequested adjustments in rates result in a typical inside city residential storm water rate increase of 1%.  When a sewer increase of 5% and a 5% increase in water rates are considered, the overall impact on a typical residential customer's bill in the City of Columbus is 4.72%, and for a typical outside city residential customer, the overall bill impact is 5.0%. Low Income Discount participant's overall bill impact is 4.67%. Outside city customers are not charged stormwater fees. Considering the 2024 rates increases for water, sewer, and storm combined -- based on an average residential customer with water use of 17 ccf's per quarter, City of Columbus residents are estimated to see their total bill increase $10.16 per quarter, or $40.65 per year. City of Columbus residents with a household of four or more with water use of 30 ccf's per quarter are estimated to see their total bill increase $15.91 per quarter, or $63.62 per year. \n \nThe stormwater ERU charge is assessed based on each property’s measured impervious surface area.  Each Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) is based on 2000 sq ft of impervious surface area.  Residents are charged at one (1) ERU per residence.  All other customers are charged based on measured impervious area divided by 2,000 sq ft to determine an ERU equivalent.\n \nThe Sewer and Water Advisory Board (SWAB) met on October 18, 2023, and after reviewing the Department of Public Utilities' projected expenditures for Fiscal Year 2024, recommends to City Council a 1% increase in storm rates. \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: These rate increases will generate approximately $400,000 in additional revenue in Fiscal Year 2024.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Section 1149.08 of the Columbus City Codes, to enact new Stormwater fees for the year beginning January 1, 2024, and to repeal the existing Section being amended.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Sewer and Water Advisory Board met on October 18, 2023, and after reviewing the Department of Public Utilities projected expenditures for 2024, recommends to City Council an increase of 1% in stormwater rates, and\n \nWHEREAS, stormwater fees are not charged to those customers outside of the City of Columbus, and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to increase the monthly Stormwater charges from $5.16 per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) to $5.21 per ERU to accurately match needed revenue to estimated program expenses; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.   That effective January 1, 2024, Section 1149.08 of the Columbus City Codes be, and is hereby, amended to read as follows:\n \n1149.08 Rate Structure\nCharges within corporate limits. For the purpose stated in Sections 1149.03 and 1149.10 there is hereby charged to each user situated within the corporate limits of the City of Columbus, that is tributary directly or indirectly to the stormwater system of the city, stormwater charges as hereinbefore provided, and in the amount determinable as follows:\n \nFor any such property, lot, parcel of land, building or premises that is tributary directly or indirectly to the stormwater system of the city, such charge shall be based upon the quantity of impervious area situated thereon.\n \n(a) All properties having impervious area within the city will be assigned an equivalent residential unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, with all properties having impervious area receiving at least one (1) ERU.\n(1) Residential properties. All residential properties will be assigned one (1) ERU. A flat rate will apply to all residential properties.\n(2) Non-residential properties. Non-residential properties will be assigned an ERU multiple based upon the properties' individually measured impervious area (in square feet) divided by two thousand (2,000) square feet (one (1) ERU). This division will be calculated to the first decimal place and rounded according to mathematical convention.\n \n(b)The charge as prescribed in the rate schedule is as follows: \n \n$.1687 $.1704 per day per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU).\n \nSECTION 2.  That stormwater rates herein established shall be applicable for all stormwater charges on or after January 1, 2024.\n \nSECTION 3.  That effective January 1, 2024, existing Section 1149.08 of the Columbus City Codes be, and is hereby, repealed.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
