    "title": "To amend Title 39 and Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and to repeal certain existing sections of Title 39 and Chapter 329, in order to update, clarify, and strengthen code regarding the operations of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and its programs.",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance amends various chapters throughout Title 39 and Sections 329.191 and 329.192 in Title 3 of the Columbus City Codes. Title 39 is the portion of Columbus City Codes governing the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. These changes vary in nature from clarifying and specifying certain administrative functions to expansions of the keystone programming under the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\n \nAs an overview, the code changes in this ordinance are as follows:\n•                     Replacing the Small Local Business Enterprise certification with the Small Regional Business Enterprise certification. This expands the program to businesses in Delaware, Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Licking, Madison, Pickaway, and Union Counties.\n•                     Removing the citizenship requirement from a business’ eligibility criteria for certification under the Office’s various supplier diversity programs.\n•                     Clarifying that businesses structured with Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are not eligible for certification under Section 3903.09 of Columbus City Codes, which pertains to the certification of joint ventures.\n•                     Amending the requirement for business eligibility pertaining to the age of the business. The changes proposed in this ordinance would amend the eligibility to require that businesses be in business for one year, rather than for six months.\n•                     Adding a one-year moratorium on re-applying for certification after a denial. This does not impact the appeal process, which is still in place under the changes proposed in this ordinance.\n•                     Adding a sunset provision for the evaluation and reauthorization of Title 39 programs.\n•                     Making technical changes to correct or clarify the code where needed, including sections of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes that reference programs under Title 39 that would change based on the amendments proposed in this ordinance.\n \nThese changes will improve the effectiveness of the programs and strengthen the operations of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion as authorized under Title 39.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo amend Title 39 and Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and to repeal certain existing sections of Title 39 and Chapter 329, in order to update, clarify, and strengthen code regarding the operations of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and its programs.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is dedicated to creating and implementing programs, policies, and procedures that will deliver and capture value through supplier diversity; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion assists underserved, under-utilized, and economically disadvantaged businesses with gaining greater access to procurement opportunities and resources to build viable and sustainable businesses; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to further the mission of supporting underserved and local businesses by creating additional pathways to procurement opportunities; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Title 39 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended per the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2. That Sections 329.191 and 329.192 of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes are hereby amended as per the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That existing Sections 329.191, 329.192, 3901.01, 3902.01, 3902.02, 3903.02, 3903.09, 3906.02, 3906.05, and Chapter 3904 of the Columbus City Codes are hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 4. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
