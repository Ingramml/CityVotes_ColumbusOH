    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.                     BACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to renew (R#2) an existing engineering agreement with CDM Smith Inc. for professional engineering services for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFS) Instrumentation and Control (I&C) Integration and Programming, Part 2 Project, 650348-100004. This project will provide needed upgrades to the existing Plant Wide Process Control System (PWPCS) at each DOSD facility. It will provide integration for the newly constructed CIP's into the existing PWPCS at the DOSD Facilities. New projects must be integrated into the PWPCS to best maintain the operational performance of the treatment facilities. This project also assists City staff in maintaining and upgrading the PWPCS at Southerly, Jackson Pike and SMOC. Future renewals are anticipated.\n \nPlanning Area: 99 Citywide\n \n  1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $500,000.00\n                             Cost summary: \n                        Original Contract                            $500,000.00\n                         Renewal 1                         $500,000.00\n        Renewal 2                                                    $500,000.00\n                           Current Total                  $1,500,000.00\n \n       1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \n This was planned contract modification/renewal. It extends the time and adds funding to perform additional task ordered work.\n \n1.3 Reasons other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis work was originally planned as a 4-year effort funded by annual renewals because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them. Bidding out this work would risk funding this substantial startup effort again, and would require the multi-year work to start again at the beginning. \n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by CDM Smith, Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable.  \n \n \n \n2.   PROJECT TIMELINE: This was initiated as a one year contract, with an option for the City to renew annually for an additional three years.  The duration of the contract may extend into subsequent years based on the complexity and progress of the assigned work.  This is year three of a four year contract. \n \n3.                     EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \n4.                     CONTRACT COMPIANCE NO: 04-2473650 | MAJ | Exp. 10/12/2022 | Vendor # 000180\n \n5.                     ECONOMIC IMPACT: This contract is essential for maintenance and troubleshooting of PWPCS, as well as integration of new equipment with the control system.  The project provides emergency response for troubleshooting of the PWPCS, which will allow more reliable service from the DOSD facilities and help to ensure that the facilities meet environmental permits.  \n \n6.   FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $500,000.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation (G.O.) Bond Fund 6109 pending the 2019 bond sale deposits.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with CDM Smith Inc. for professional engineering services for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTFS) Instrumentation and Control (I&C) Integration and Programming, Part 2 Project;and to authorize the expenditure of $500,000.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund.
