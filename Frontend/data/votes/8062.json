    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, to modify an existing contract with Granicus, LLC (formerly known as Rock Solid Technology, Inc.), for hosting of the 311 Respond System. This contract was first authorized by ordinance 1765-2020. The term of the initial contract agreement was for five (5) years from the date of a purchase order certified/confirmed by the City Auditor's Office.\n  \nSince going live in April 2022, the 311 Respond System has helped facilitate over 700,000 customer contacts. Use of an off-the-shelf system that is utilized in other communities provides the 311 Customer Service Center with access to ongoing updates and access to industry best practices. This contributes to the ability of the 311 team to provide excellent customer service to all residents when they make contact by phone, e-mail, the 311 website, CBUS 311 mobile app and in person at the Neighborhood Pride Centers.  \n \nThe expenditure being authorized by this ordinance is comprised of three parts. First is a $253,500.00 charge for an annual maintenance agreement. This modification will be for one (1) year, starting on March 30, 2024, and ending on March 29, 2025. The second is a $15,362.00 change order, needed for various updates, including software changes and features in the OneView system that will enhance the capabilities of the current CRM System. Finally, there is $20,000 in contingency funds to cover unforeseen issues or requests for changes. \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $288,862.00 for the above-described purpose.\n \nMODIFICATION \nI.                     Original cost -                                                               $1,000,000.00\nII.                     Cost of this modification-                     $  288,862.00\nIII.                     Total modified cost-                                          $1,288,862.00\nIV.                     The need for additional funds is to pay for annual renewal and maintenance not covered by the initial allotment noted above. The original quote provided by the vendor was 1,096,651. However, only $1,000,000.00   was available in the department’s capital fund at that time. Thus part of this modification is to cover the original shortfall.\nV.                     It is not in the city’s best interest to go through other procurement processes as the maintenance and upgrades of 311 Respond System is still under contract with Granicus (a.k.a., Rock Solid). It would be disruptive to current services to change vendors at this time.\nVI.                     The reason for the modification described above is to fund the upcoming annual maintenance agreement not cover in the original contract and to cover the original shortfall, noted in item IV.\nVII.                     The cost of the afore-described modification is the actual cost of (i) one year’s annual maintenance agreement in 2024; (ii) the cost the vendor originally quoted to undertake necessary updates to keep the system current; and (iii) estimate of contingency needs.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nOrdinance 1765-2020, passed on July 27, 2020, authorized expending $1,000,000.00 from the capital improvement fund for the original five-year contract. Funds for this ordinance are budgeted and available in DoT’s 2023 operating budget, contingent on passage of Ordinance 3005-2023, which authorizes a transfer within the Information Services operating fund, in accordance with 2023 third quarter review projections.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nGranicus, LLC\nVendor #-007882, Expiration Date: 5/30/2025\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology, on behalf of the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, to modify an existing contract with Granicus, LLC. for hosting of the 311 Respond System; and to authorize the expenditure of $288,862.00 from the Information Services operating budget for the above-mentioned service.
