    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with ms consultants, inc. to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - Gender Road - Winchester Pike to Brice Road project.\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, in engaged in a study to develop a plan for improvements to the Gender Road corridor from Winchester Pike to Brice Road and a portion of Brice Road between Gender Road and Chantry Drive to meet the terminus of the I-70 Far East Freeway project. The project includes transportation and traffic research, traffic analysis, and a feasibility study to result in a program of fundable transportation infrastructure projects to improve safety, implement complete street improvements, and accommodate future development.\nOrdinance 0064-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with ms consultants, inc. for the Roadway - Gender Road - Winchester Pike to Brice Road project.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $100,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $100,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $350,000.00                          (PO311328, Ord. 0064-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $100,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $450,000.00 \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe original contract was to complete a feasibility study. After working through the feasibility study it was determined this project would make a good MORPC grant funding application and additional work would need to be done.  This modification will allow for the additional work needed in order to complete the MORPC grant screening application and funding application.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe consultant has already begun work on the application in conjunction with other tasks.  It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against ms consultants, inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for ms consultants, inc. is CC006998 and expires 12/28/2023.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $100,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to meet the submittal deadlines for the MORPC grant funding application.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with ms consultants, inc. in connection with the Roadway - Gender Road - Winchester Pike to Brice Road project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
