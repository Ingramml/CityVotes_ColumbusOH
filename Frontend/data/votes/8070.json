    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify and increase an existing contract with Strawser Paving Co., Inc. (\"Strawser Paving Company\") for the Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way project in an amount up to $400,000.00.\nOrdinance 1820-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Strawser Paving Company for the construction of the Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way project and to provide for construction administration and inspection services.  This contract includes the reconstruction and realignment of Little Turtle Way from the entrance ramp to SR161 West Bound to Firewater Lane. The reconstruction will include the installation of a roundabout at the intersection of Little Turtle Way and Longrifle Road.  Longrifle Road will be reconstructed between Garand Drive and Double Eagle Drive. Full depth reconstruction will follow the alignment of the existing Little Turtle Way West, and other work as may be necessary to complete the contract in accordance with the plans and specifications set forth in the Bid Submittal Documents.\n \nThe construction of the project is currently in progress.  The project has experienced a delay of six months due to a restraining order halting construction as result of litigation regarding Right-of-Way acquisition for the project.  The project has required extra work not originally in the contract including the resurfacing of existing northbound Little Turtle Way, flooding mitigation, stormwater pollution prevention plan and the resurfacing of Firewater Lane and Double Eagle Drive.  These items have depleted the contingency funds.\n \nModification 1 will provide additional contingency funds for future unforeseen circumstances and extra work to ensure construction remains on-schedule. \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $450,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $5,305,300.70     (PO310508, Ord. 1820-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $   400,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $5,705,300.70  \n \nThe amount of construction administration and inspection services will be $50,000.00.  The total legislated amount is $450,000.00.\n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe additional funds requested with this contract modification, will replenish the funds from the original project contingency to adjust contract prices as a result of the delayed notice to proceed and address multiple unforeseen circumstances during the early stages of construction. This modification also includes the estimated cost to resurface the existing pavement of Double Eagle Drive from existing northbound Little Turtle Way to proposed Little Turtle Way and Firewater Lane east of Little Turtle Way.  These pavement sections are not included in the project to be resurfaced but their existing deteriorated conditions and proximity within the project limits warrants resurfacing with the project.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis contract modification provides additional contingency funds for future unforeseen circumstances and extra work to ensure construction remains on-schedule.  It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost for all items, aside from resurfacing the existing pavement sections of Double Eagle Drive and Firewater Lane, was determined via actual cost force account as labor, material, and equipment costs were tracked while work was performed. The cost for resurfacing the existing pavement sections of Double Eagle Drive and Firewater Lane was determined as an estimated cost based on contract line items.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Strawser Paving Company.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Strawser Paving Company is CC006114 and expires 1/17/2025.\n \n3.  Pre-Qualification Status\nStrawser Paving Company and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $450,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures.  \n \n5. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of this program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n7.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency legislation is necessary to ensure funds are available in the event additional unforeseen circumstances or other extra work is required as work on the project continues to progress this construction season.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds between projects within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Strawser Paving Co., Inc. in connection with the Roadway Improvements - Little Turtle Way project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $450,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($450,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
