    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Mead and Hunt, Inc. (\"Mead and Hunt\") to add funds for design of the Intersection Improvements - Georgesville Road at Hall Road project.\nOrdinance 1850-2018 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Mead and Hunt for the Intersection Improvements - Georgesville Road at Hall Road project.  The project consists of the design of improvements to the intersection of Georgesville Road at Hall Road aimed at reducing crash frequency and severity.  The improvements include the addition of an eastbound right turn lane and a southbound right turn lane and the reconstruction of the traffic signal to include the following components: LED signal heads with backplates, countdown type pedestrian signal heads and pedestrian push buttons for crossing the west and south legs, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), and supplemental signal heads.  Additionally, the clearance intervals will be reviewed and adjusted as needed.\n \nOrdinance 1692-2020 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $215,432.72 for additional design services.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $30,000.00.\n \nOrdinance 0507-2017 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to execute Highway Safety Program grant agreements with the Ohio Department of Transportation, accept and expend grant funds, and issue refunds if necessary after final accounting for the Intersection Improvements - Georgesville Road at Hall Road project.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $30,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $256,366.00                     (PO140812, Ord. 1850-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $215,432.72                     (PO235256, Ord. 1692-2020)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $  30,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $501,798.72  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis contract modification includes efforts to modify drainage design and update the basin design.
