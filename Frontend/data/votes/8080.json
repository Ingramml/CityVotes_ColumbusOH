    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with CTL Engineering, Inc. to provide facility condition assessment services for the Capital Asset Management Program Update Project. The contract amount is $879,430.00, with a contingency of $120,000.00, for a total of $999,430.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department needs a partner to perform facility condition assessments and review and update, as necessary, the information currently contained within the Department's Asset Planner database. The current Asset Planner is a portfolio of the Department's facility infrastructure. This project will determine the assets' age, condition, repair history, and state and use it to develop a routine that maximizes each capital investment's life.\n \nThis project has two primary goals. The first is to update and refresh the Department's assets, which have been identified and recorded in the existing Asset Planner portfolio. The second goal is to determine where each asset exists in its life cycle and assign activities that optimize its life. Once a task is identified, it will be scheduled and imported into a work order system that will assign each task to staff to perform the work.\n \nThis project will ensure that the capital assets will be utilized to maximize their life span and minimize capital expenditures. Also, by updating the information in Asset Planner, the Department's decisions associated with the five-year capital plan will be validated by maximizing the return on investment. Furthermore, the assets will operate in a manner that complies with the Energy Management and Climate Action Plans.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services and Bonfire, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 15, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 05, 2023.
