    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to issue a Parkland Dedication Ordinance (PDO) park development fee refund to TV Residential, LLC. The refund amount being authorized by this ordinance is $50,437.00.\n \nThe Thurber Village Apartments Project was first proposed in 2021 and, during the preliminary process, the property required a change in use to allow the project to be built. The practice per Columbus City Code Chapter 3318, Parkland Dedication, is to require a Parkland Dedication Ordinance (PDO) park development fee for a development like this proposal. When a land use change of over 1 acre is required to build residential dwelling units, the PDO is triggered to support the fiscal needs of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department for land acquisition and park development in order to meet the needs of the new residents living in those units. Initially, the Thurber Village plans were reviewed and, through standard rules and regulations, a park development fee instead of land was assessed. A total of $151,312.00 was paid as required for final engineering approval. Due to subsequent design changes, there was an updated review and, during that time, it was found that additional recreational amenities were intended to be built as part of this project. The inclusion of a swimming pool, fitness center, and pickleball court were found to be adequate in order to receive an exemption for a portion of the park development fee. If these additions to the project had been shown previously, the park development fee would have reflected this. Therefore, $50,437.00 is requested to be refunded to TV Residential, LLC, recognizing the cost of the construction of the swimming pool, fitness center, and pickleball court. The increased number and variety of recreational amenities being constructed will benefit the entire Thurber Village Community.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nTV Residential, LLC \n250 Civic Center Drive, Suite 500\nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                     \nGriffin Caldwell, (614) 227-3465                                                                                                 \nContract Compliance Number: 047013\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to expedite the reimbursement of overpayment of funds received for the parkland dedication requirement prior to the end of fiscal year 2023. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The increased number and variety of recreational amenities being constructed will benefit the entire Thurber Village Community.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for facilities and amenities through public workshops, social media, and direct contact with City staff.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: Victorian Village (46)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by expanding access to a variety of recreational opportunities for all residents.\n \nFiscal Impact: $50,437.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this refund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to issue a Parkland Dedication Ordinance (PDO) park development fee refund to TV Residential, LLC; to authorize the appropriation of $50,437.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $50,437.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; and to declare an emergency.
