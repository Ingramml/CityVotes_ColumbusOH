    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Land and Water Conservation Fund Program. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Program is accepting applications for funding to develop and restore public outdoor recreation and educational areas. If awarded, the funding will be used to restore the Hoover Mudflats Boardwalk.\n \nODNR is accepting grant applications for the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act Program. The grant is expected to be $500,000.00. The grant offers assistance to governmental agencies in developing public outdoor recreation and educational areas. Grant applications are due November 15, 2023 with a 30-day allowance to submit the resolution. The notification of the grant acceptance will be awarded in the spring of 2024. \n \nODNR requires a resolution, ordinance, or other written documentation that obligates funds for the project as part of the application. Therefore, this ordinance is a commitment to provide the necessary match funds to satisfactorily complete the proposed project and become eligible for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the grant. If the grant funding is awarded, future legislation will follow to authorize acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of City funds from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund. The Recreation and Parks Department has already met the required match, with the $540,000 City funds from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund for the design of the project.   \n \nColumbus Recreation and Parks is requesting support to apply for the Land and Water Conservation Fund grant to help fund the Hoover Mudflats boardwalk replacement. The project site is located in the Hoover Nature Preserve, located near the Village of Galena. The current boardwalk has been closed and inaccessible, due to its poor condition, since 2020. Similarly, given the illegal access, vandalism, and safety concerns, the parking lot to the Hoover Mudflats Nature Preserve has also been closed. The Hoover boardwalk will increase accessibility and usage of the Hoover Nature Preserve. The opportunity to apply for the Land and Water Conservation Fund grant will augment costs for the construction of the Hoover boardwalk that is currently 50% through the design phase. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources - Land and Water Conservation Fund\n2045 Morse Road, Building E-2\nColumbus, Ohio 43229                                                 \nDee Burlison, (614) 265-6834                                                                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 005089\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested to meet the application deadline of November 15, 2023 and the resolution of authorization of December 15, 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The boardwalk will increase access for the community to the park and the Hoover Nature Preserve.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: There have been public meetings regarding the Hoover boardwalk, where stakeholders have provided questions, comments, and input.
