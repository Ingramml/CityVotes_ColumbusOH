    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Custom Lawn Care & Landscaping, L.L.C. for the Street Tree Installation Fall 2023 Project. The contract amount is $262,874.50, with a contingency of $7,125.50, for a total of $270,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThis project will be installing 754 trees in numerous Columbus neighborhoods and in all Forestry Planning Areas to help replace tree species that have been removed due to tree mortality. The project will also include planting new trees in areas that previously did not have trees. The new tree plantings will represent a diverse species of trees selected specifically for each planting location. Selection will take into consideration the specific site restrictions that each location has in an effort to replace some of our lost Urban Tree Canopy. These plantings will help to reduce storm water run-off in the area while not interfering with nearby utilities or structures.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on August 24, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on September 19, 2023. Bids were received from the following companies:\n \nCustom Lawn Care & Landscaping (MAJ): $262,874.50\nMarlczewski’s Lawn Care (MAJ): $270,140.00\nGreenscapes Landscape (MAJ): $289,965.00\n \nAfter reviewing the bids that were submitted, it was determined that Custom Lawn Care & Landscaping, L.L.C. was the lowest and most responsive bidder. Custom Lawn Care & Landscaping, LLC and all proposed subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to prequalification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCustom Lawn Care & Landscaping, L.L.C.\n2411 SR 22 SW                                                      \nWashington Court House, Ohio 43160\nKyle Reed, (740) 333-1669                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 005898\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: January 31, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Recreation and Parks Department as tree planting has specific periods of time when it is most beneficial to plant trees.  Traditional 30 day legislation would result in an insufficient period of time to schedule the work, order and plant the trees before ideal planting conditions are lost to colder winter temperatures.\n \nBenefits to the Public: These plantings will increase the Urban Tree Canopy which reduces storm water runoff, reduces utility costs to nearby homes and businesses, and reduces air pollution.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The majority of the trees being planted during this contract have been requested by the property owners where the trees are being planted or at locations where trees had been previously removed for varying reasons. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the departments Master Plan by planting trees intended to both replace and add to the City of Columbus’ urban tree canopy. It will be adding to the total overall canopy levels and is helping to reduce storm water runoff, heat-island effects and replace trees lost due varying causes of tree mortality.\n \nFiscal Impact: $270,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Custom Lawn Care & Landscaping, L.L.C. for the Street Tree Installation Fall 2023 Project; to authorize the expenditure of $270,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
