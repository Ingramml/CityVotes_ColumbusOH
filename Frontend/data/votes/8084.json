    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resource (ODNR) for the H2Ohio Grant Acceptance Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of the grant. The grant amount is $850,000.00.\n \nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) accepted the Recreation and Parks application in August for the H2Ohio grant program.  The H2Ohio grant is a reimbursable grant that supports projects for natural-infrastructure that focus on nutrient reduction and water quality within the Ohio River Basin.     \n \nThis grant application is to develop a wetland at Three Creeks Park. In July 2023, the Recreation and Parks Commission reviewed and approved the request to apply for the H2Ohio grant. Three Creeks Park is a 1,097 acre park in the Far South Community and is joint-managed by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department and Franklin County Metro Parks. This project will create a 12-acre wetland and 20-acres of restored project area. On October 26, 2023, the grant application was awarded.  \n \nThree Creeks Park was historically farmed but wetlands have been developing over the past decade as the land has naturally converted from agricultural use. It is important to restore the wetlands at Three Creeks Park, as 90 percent of all wetlands in Ohio have been lost. Wetlands improve water quality and provide flood control. Wetlands serve as critical habitat for a variety of wildlife and capture carbon dioxide. Additionally, this grant allows for the planting of additional trees to help support the Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP) and the low canopy within the far south of the City. \n \nODNR awarded the wetland project for $850,000.00, included in the application is the commitment to use $200,000.00 of Capital Improvement Project funds to improve recreational amenities and $125,000.00 donation for tree plantings within the project area, for a project total of $1,175,000.00. This project will also provide a protection plan outline for the next 20 years. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once construction is ready to move forward. \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources\n2045 Morse Road, Building B\nColumbus, Ohio 43229                                                 \nRachel DeNoewer, (614) 705-9978                                                                                                      \nContract Compliance Number: 005089\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so that the Director of Recreation and Parks can immediately sign the grant agreement and accept the funding to meet the deadline of December 31, 2023.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Protection of the city’s high quality waterways and wetlands is of great benefit to current and future generations. Wetlands improve water quality, improve flood control, reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, and serve as a critical habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The restoration of wetlands at Three Creeks Park will also support the Urban Forestry Master Plan with additional tree plantings.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Far South Area Community Commission and the William Creek Community have been in support of the preparation of the grant and will continue to be engaged during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project.\n \nArea(s) Affected: \nFar South (64)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the City’s natural resources and overall environmental health for current and future generations.
