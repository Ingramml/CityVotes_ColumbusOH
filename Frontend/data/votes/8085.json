    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Strawser Paving Co., Inc. for the Griggs Culvert Pipe Replacement - Nottingham Road Project. The contract amount is $168,142.00, and a contingency of $50,000.00, for a total of $218,142.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $220,142.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThe main entry to Trabue-Murphy Boat Launch parking lots have two 310 foot long galvanized steel storm drain pipes that were installed approximately in 1971. They were installed to aid in draining storm water away from the parking lot and the low lying area at the entry. Due to the age and nature of these drain lines they have significantly corroded and are now allowing storm water to flow into the bedding of the drain pipe. This has caused a failure of the entry drive and a sink hole has developed creating a potential hazard for public access to the area. To correct this problem and extend the life of the drainage system we are planning to install two new 310 foot long concrete drain pipes.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on October 12, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 2, 2023.
