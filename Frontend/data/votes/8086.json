    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & DeHaven, Inc. DBA GPD Group to provide professional services associated with the Whetstone Field Improvements - Design Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $210,000.00.\n \nThe additional proposed improvements are part of the Whetstone Park Sports Field Improvements project and will be included as its own complete set of construction documents. An assessment has been completed for the casting pond and adjacent shelter to determine the needed improvements for those portions of the park which are adjacent to the sports field project. This modification was planned, but were not included as part of the original contract until the assessment was completed and the necessary improvements were identified.\n \nThis part of the project involves the restoration of the existing casting pond at Whetstone Park, stream modifications, and a hydraulic analysis of the 398 linear feet of an existing channel.  The modification also includes designs for a culvert repair and replacement of the existing shelter by the pond.  The project location is between the two sports fields that were included in the original contract, which will allow for an overlap of construction for the two phases.  Fees were determined by anticipating hours and applying costs already established by the original contract.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nGlaus,Pyle, Schomer, Burns & DeHaven, Inc. DBA GPD Group\n1801 Watermark Drive, Suite 210\nColumbus, Ohio 43215\nAngela Short, (614) 588-8955\nContract Compliance Number: 006560\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: May 24, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order complete the design plans and bid both portions of the construction project on the same schedule. This would save money, time and decrease the disturbance for the public.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will improve and provide amenities to the community for fishing and gatherings.  Needed improvements have been identified by both staff and the community.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community has expressed the desire for the pond to be refurbished due to concern of the failing stone wall surrounding the pond.  The shelter currently poses a safety concern with unsupervised fires in the fire place in the existing shelter.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Clintonville (39)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by expanding offerings and amenities to appeal to a more diversified group of park users. \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $275,000.00 was legislated for the Whetstone Field Improvements Project by Ordinance 2752-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $210,000.00. $210,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $485,000.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Glaus, Pyle, Schomer, Burns & DeHaven, Inc.
