    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Arcadis U.S. Inc. for the JPWWTP Power Systems Upgrade and Safety Improvements project, CIP #650257-100101, in an amount up to $716,000.00.\n \nThe original contract was for preliminary design services relating to arc flash hazards and coordination issues with electrical equipment at the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant (JPWWTP). The first portion of the project evaluated electrical equipment that will need to be replace and provided recommendations for replacement or rehabilitation.\n \nAfter preliminary design it was discovered more electrical issues needed to be addressed and construction cost estimates were doubled.\n \nThis contract modification will provide detailed design documents for the construction portion of the project, which will replace and rehabilitate the equipment. This design is based on the recommendations provided in the Detailed Design Memorandum (DDM) deliverable from Step 1 - Preliminary Design Services, of the original contract. \n \nA second contract modification will be requested for engineering services during construction.\n \nCommunity Planning Area: 99-Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $716,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $363,100.00                     (Ord. 2953-2021 PO308101)\nModification #1 (current):                       $716,000.00  \nFuture Modification (estimate)                                $540,000.00  \nTotal (Orig. + Modification + Future):                      $1,619,100.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThe contract was awarded with the intention of one design company performing all phases of the design work.  The preliminary design services were completed by Arcadis in the original contract, with contract modifications planned to add funding for detailed design and for services during construction.  Arcadis has intimate knowledge of the project scope and how the detailed design should proceed to address all the needs to go from preliminary design to detailed design.  Re-bidding the contract would create a 4-6 month delay in the project and we would lose the institutional knowledge gained by Arcadis through the preliminary design process.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based upon the scope of work for the detail design modification and based upon the existing job titles and contract rates for those job titles.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed and approved the estimate.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will replace equipment that is past its useful life or that no longer meets the electrical loads required by the plant. Replacing this equipment will reduce the amount of maintenance needed to keep the plant operational as well as reducing the number of electrical safety issues. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nArcadis U.S. Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC009409 and expires 2/22/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis U.S. Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.   Arcadis U.S. Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.   Arcadis U.S. Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 2.4%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Arcadis U.S. Inc. has proposed the following two subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nBrown and Caldwell                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nRegency Construction Services, Inc.                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \nThe certification of Arcadis U.S. Inc. and the above companies were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n 5.
