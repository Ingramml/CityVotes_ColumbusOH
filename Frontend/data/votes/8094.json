    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with K.N.S.

The service will include purchase and installation of new cameras, workstations, and mounts.  \n \nK.N.S. Services, Inc. currently provides installation, integration, service and support for the Genetec security surveillance system. K.N.S. Services, Inc. is the only Unified Elite Genetec Partner in Ohio and as such K.N.S. Services, Inc. maintains the Genetec system licensing and programming. Therefore, due to the proprietary nature of the security software and compatibility of existing security and camera equipment, it is in the best interest of the City to enter into contract with K.N.S.
