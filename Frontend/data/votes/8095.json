    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into contracts with Ethosoft, Inc. for professional services and installation services for the DOSD and DOW Lab Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade project, CIP #650665-100001 / 690572-100000, in an amount up to $831,809.00. \n \nThe City operates a Division of Water (DOW) Water Quality Assurance Laboratory (WQAL) and Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) Surveillance Laboratory.  Currently each lab has a different process for information management, both of which are outdated and don’t meet the workflows of the labs.  This project will provide a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for both labs to meet the current and future needs of these laboratories and to maintain regulatory compliance.  Implementation of the LIMS program in both labs will streamline information input, usage, and reporting for regulatory compliance.  Both labs are essential and integral components in the City of Columbus water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water and wastewater treatment is essential to economic growth.\n \nThis project will provide configuration, installation implementation, training, and annual ongoing licensing, maintenance, and support of the LIMS software.  This contract will incorporate the implementation of the LIMS system and five years of licensing and support of the LIMS software.  Licensing and software support will need to continue after this initial five-year period for the remaining life of the system.  It is anticipated this continuing support will be done in new five-year contracts and awarded through a waiver of the City’s competitive bidding process due to licensing and software support only being available through a single company.  \n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE:  It is anticipated this project will have two contracts for the initial term of this project.  One contract will cover implementation of the LIMS System and the first year of licensing and software support.  The term of this contract will be from issuance of a Notice to Proceed authorizing the start of work to final acceptance of the system by the City.  The second contract will start when the licensing and software support for the first contract ends and covers the next four years of licensing and support.      \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The price of the LIMS implementation and licensing and software support for the first five years of the system life has been established and set as shown below in the Original Contracts amount.  Additional funds are not anticipated to be needed for the original contracts.  The City will need ongoing licensing and support for the life of the LIMS software that will extend beyond the terms of the initial contracts.  That pricing is unknown at this time and will be negotiated and legislated for the implementation of the next licensing and support contract.  \n                     \n                                                               Original Contracts                                                                                                          $           831,809.00\n                                                               Future Anticipated Needs (original contracts only)                      $                     0.00\n                                                                       ORIGINAL CONTRACTS TOTAL                                                       $            831,809.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nCurrently each lab has a different process for information management, both of which are outdated and don’t meet the work flows of the labs.  Implementation of the LIMS program in both labs will streamline information input, usage, and reporting for regulatory compliance.  Both labs are essential and integral components in the City of Columbus water supply and treatment infrastructure.  Adequate safe supply of water and wastewater treatment is essential to economic growth.  Public informational meetings are not anticipated for this project.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 9/23/22.   Seven proposals were received:\n \nName                                              C.C.

An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into contracts with Ethosoft, Inc. for the DOSD and DOW Lab Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund and the Water Reserve Fund to the Sanitary Fresh Water Market Rate Fund and to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; to authorize the appropriation of funds; and to expend up to $831,809.00 from Sanitary Fresh Water Market Rate Fund and the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund.  ($831,809.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the DOSD and DOW Lab Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade project; and\nWHEREAS, a Request for Proposals was issued for that project; and\nWHEREAS, Ethosoft, Inc. was selected by the Department of Public Utilities to provide services for the project; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to contract with Ethosoft to provide services for the project; and \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0997-2023 authorized the use of loans from the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program to finance Public Utilities projects; and\nWHEREAS, loan applications will be submitted to OWDA to finance this project; and\nWHEREAS, an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project; and \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to both appropriate and transfer funds between the Sanitary Reserve Fund and the Water Reserve Fund to the Sanitary Fresh Water Market Rate Fund and the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to appropriate funds in the Sanitary Fresh Water Market Rate Fund and the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; and \nWHEREAS, the City anticipates incurring certain Original Expenditures (as defined in Section 1.150-2(c) of the Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) promulgated pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) with respect to the services of the Project described in this Ordinance (collectively, the “Project”); and\n \nWHEREAS, funds must be expended to pay for the services Ethosoft, Inc. provides under the DOSD and DOW Lab Information Management System (LIMS) Upgrade contract; and NOW, THEREFORE\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\nFund / Project Number / Project Name (Funding Source) / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change\n6124 / 650665-100001 / DOSD LIMS Upgrade (OWDA Direct Loan) / $0.00 / $415,905.00 / $415,905.00 (To match loan amount)\n6014 / 690572-100000 / DOW LIMS Upgrade (OWDA Direct Loan) / $0.00 / $415,905.00 / $415,905.00 (To match loan amount)\nSECTION 2.
