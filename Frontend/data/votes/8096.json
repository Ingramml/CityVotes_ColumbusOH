    "description": "Explanation                     \n1.  BACKGROUND\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with, and make a purchase from, The Henry P. Thompson Company, LLC for four pumps and related appurtenances (two sludge return pumps and two plant drain pumps) for the Dublin Road Water Plant for the Department of Public Utilities.\n \nThe Dublin Road Water Plant’s (DRWP) existing sludge pumps and drain pumps are beyond their useful life and need to be replaced to maintain the plant’s functionality and reliability.  The DRWP provides potable water to a large portion of the City’s service areas and the sludge return pumps and the basin drain pumps are critical components of the water treatment process.  This project is necessary to maintain the reliability of the water treatment process.  No community outreach or public meetings are anticipated.\n \nThe Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids for the four pumps and related appurtenances (two sludge return pumps and two plant drain pumps) in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding (RFQ025866).  Forty-eight (48) bidders were solicited and one (MAJ) bid was received and opened on September 28, 2023.\n \n    Name                                                                        Bid Amount_______   _City/State                 Status                     \nThe Henry P.

Thompson Company, LLC for four pumps for the Dublin Road Water Plant for the Department of Public Utilities; to amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $475,000.00 from the Water Bond Fund to pay for this purchase.  ($475,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities has a need for four pumps and related appurtenances (two sludge return pumps and two plant drain pumps) to be used for preventative maintenance and on demand repair work at the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP); and\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office opened formal bids on September 28, 2023 for the purchase of four pumps and related appurtenances (two sludge return pumps and two plant drain pumps) for the DRWP; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Water, recommends an award be made to the lowest, responsive, responsible and best bidder, The Henry P.
