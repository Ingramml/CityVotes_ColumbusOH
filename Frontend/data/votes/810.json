    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the first of two renewals of two contracts first authorized by Ordinance 1205-2020. This ordinance, passed on June 1, 2020, authorized entering into contracts with Woolpert Inc. and EMHT to provide professional GIS services in support of the Departments of Public Utilities, Public Service, Neighborhoods, Development, and Technology’s GIS applications and projects. The single point coordination and management of this contract by DoT increases efficiencies.
