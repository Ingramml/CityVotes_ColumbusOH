    "title": "To authorize the Director of Public Utilities to extend the agreement with Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC for the design, construction and operation of the Organic Waste Recovery and Reuse System Project; and to declare an emergency ($0.00). (REPEALED BY ORD. 0297-2024 PASSED 3/4/2024)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to extend the contract for the Organic Waste Processing Agreement between the City of Columbus (City) and Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC (Kurtz). \n \nThis contract extension will be in effect from December 1, 2023 through November 30, 2024. This extension carries no fiscal implications and merely extends the existing contract:\n \nFixed Rate Sewerage Sludge Processing Term:\n \nThe contract continues a fixed rate fee of $33.50 per wet ton of sewerage sludge processing for the duration of this contract (10 years + 5 year extension). This contract authorizes the transfer to the organic waste recovery and reuse system of up to 25,000 wet tons of sewerage sludge per year at this rate. This contract provides DOSD with an additional beneficial alternative use option for sewerage sludge.\n \nLog Grinding:\n \nThe contract adds a provision to fund log grinding services utilizing funds originally intended for hauling incinerator ash as part of a beneficial reuse program at the City’s two wastewater treatment plants. Incinerator ash had been historically stored at the treatment plants in lagoons and land filled at considerable expense to DOSD. This program allowed for up to 5,000 tons of wastewater treatment incinerator ash a year to be removed and adapted for beneficial reuse at a rate of $30.97 per ton, which was less than the land filing cost to the City. However, in 2015, the City ceased incineration of sewerage sludge, and thus incinerator ash generation, prior to the end of the contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nKurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC | Federal EIN 20-3524137 | D365 Vendor #001253 | Expires 11/04/2024 | Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC does not hold MBE/WBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nNo fiscal impact \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to avoid a lapse in organic waste hauling services. Passage of non-emergency legislation would result in a gap between the end of the current contract iteration and the start of this proposed modification.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to extend the agreement with Kurtz Brothers Central Ohio, LLC for the design, construction and operation of the Organic Waste Recovery and Reuse System Project;
