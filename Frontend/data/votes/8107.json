    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC to allow for expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify an agreement with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC to allow for expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order.  \n \nOriginal                                          $1,900,000.00                                          Ord. 3279-2022 (Amend. by Ord. 0251-2023) PO363469\nMod 1                                          $              0.00\nTotal                                          $1,900,000.00\n \nThe original ordinance, No. 2049-2022, passed on July 25, 2022, allowed for the establishment of a Housing Development Agreement to utilize Affordable Housing bond funds from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget in the amount of $1,400,000.00.  The Original Ordinance was amended by Ordinance No. 3279-2022, passed December 5, 2022, to allow for the establishment of $1,900,000.00 from the City’s 2022 Capital Budget, through a bond agreement, with a Housing Development Agreement no longer needed.  A contract was executed on December 9, 2022.  An amendment Ordinance No. 3279-2022 was authorized by Ordinance No. 0251-2023 on February 6, 2023.  However, because a contract with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund, LLC had already been executed, an ordinance requesting approval of a contract modification should have been submitted.  This legislation is to request a contract modification of the agreement to allow for costs incurred prior to the PO. \nThe Columbus Renaissance Housing development is intended to be structured as a partnership organized strategically to pair a local place-based neighborhood nonprofit entities, Community Development for All People (“CD4AP”) with Woda Cooper Companies, Inc. (\"Woda\"), a highly experienced nationwide developer, who will serve as general contractor and property manager.\nColumbus Renaissance Housing is located at 33 West Morrill Avenue in Merion Village.  The project is a single-phase development to occur on multi parcel former industrial manufacturing site that is bounded by existing housing on two adjacent sides, a church, and the Salvation Army, and is just a short distance outside of the central downtown core.  \nThe property will feature affordable workforce housing with all units at 60% AMI. The project will be geared toward a variety of residents: young professionals, single-parent households, small families and even seniors. The combined project will foster services to support families, aging-in-place, and workforce housing concepts. Amenities on-site will include management offices, a health and wellness center, community rooms, and more. The project is within steps of COTA bus stops, the Berliner Sports Park, several restaurants, houses of worship, Salvation Army, and Southwood Elementary School.\nIn addition to the myriad of supportive services and programming opportunities directly offered through Community Development For All People, the development will also engage with other local partners to expand future programming to be offered to all family households, single parents, seniors or anyone residing at the Columbus Renaissance Housing.\nThe building will include twelve (12) one-bedroom units, twenty-eight (28) two bedroom units and six (6) three-bedroom units. All apartments will have at least one (1) full bathroom; the three-bedroom units may have 1.5 bathrooms, pending final project design and budgeting. Over 10% of the project units will be fully accessible and at least three (3) additional units for hearing/vision impaired residents. All of the units will be “Visit-Able” with a zero-step entrance and widths/clearances acceptable to accommodating residents and visitors with wheelchairs, walkers and other mobility-assisting devices, as well as feature elements of Universal Design promoting “aging in place.”\n \nEmergency action is requested as this project is currently in construction and the developer is ready to invoice for these funds.  A modification to the original agreement is needed to allow for expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order.  Emergency designation of this ordinance permits that the modification will be fully executed prior to year-end close.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  None.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 033062 and expires on 06/24/2024.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract with Erie Ohio Capital CDFI Fund LLC to allow for expenses incurred prior to the creation of the purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
