    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to renew contract (renewal number 4) authorized under ordinance 2721-2020 with E.E. Ward Moving & Storage for an additional year to provide storage services to the Lead Safe Columbus program.  \n \nOriginal contract amount                     $45,000                     .00                     PO242634                                                                                    PY 2020\nRenewal No. 1 amount                                          $         0.00                                                               Ord. No. 2721-2020                     PY 2021\nRenewal No. 2 amount                                          $         0.00                                                                                                                              PY 2022\nRenewal No. 3 amount                                          $         0.00                                                               Ord. No 2899-2022                     PY 2023\nRenewal No. 4 amount                                          $         0.00                                                                                                                              PY 2024\nTotal contract amount                                          $45,000.00\n \nThe city applied for and received a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grant in late 2019.  The grant term is 3 ½ years.  This HUD grant funds the Lead Safe Columbus program and was extended through 2024 because of COVID-19.\n \nThe purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program is to generate lead safe affordable housing and to prevent lead poising of children and adults within Columbus neighborhoods. The purpose of this contract is to provide storage services for occupants while lead hazard work is completed on their home.  \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ014330 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for storage services for the Lead Safe Columbus program.  Two bids were received and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19.  For the original contract, the contract period is from the date of approval of the purchase order to December 31, 2020, with an option to renew until the grant period has been completed.  Because the federal grant allows renewal of contracts for services for the term of the grant, the department desires to utilize this option to effectively and efficiently manage the program.  Advertising for services annually would interrupt the program and possibly result in the program not meeting its required goals.  The fee for services in the contract renewal will be the same as that of the original contract. \n \nThis legislation will extend the contract an additional year, ending December 31, 2024. The original deadline for this grant was extended into 2024 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to continue to services without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is not needed for this renewal.  Funding remaining on the original purchase order shall be utilized under this contract renewal.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 005928 and expires 9/6/2025.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to renew a contract with E.E. Ward Moving & Storage for an additional year to provide storage services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development has identified the need to renew a contract authorized under ordinance 2721-2020 with E.E. Ward  Moving & Storage for an additional year to provide storage services to the Lead Safe Columbus program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development advertised RFQ014330 on Vendor Services in November 2019 for storage  services for the Lead Safe Columbus program, two bids were received, and the Director of Development entered into contract with both bidders under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.19; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation will extend the contract an additional year due to COVID-19, ending December 31, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that this contract renewal should be authorized immediately so continue program services without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Development be and is hereby authorized to renew a contract authorized under ordinance 2721-2020 with E.E.
