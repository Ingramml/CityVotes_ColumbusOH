    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to renew and enter into the fifth and final year of a five year contract with Mythics, Inc. for the purchase of annual Oracle software licensing, maintenance, and support services for the coverage term period of June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, in the amount of $772,702.94.  The Department of Technology originally procured these services with Mythics, Inc. through chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code, pursuant to RFQ005505.  The original contract was authorized by Ordinance 1019-2017, passed on July 10, 2017 through purchase order PO073339. The contract was most recently renewed by the authority of Ordinance No. 1020-2020, passed on through purchase order PO233016.  The contract included language that allowed for four (4) additional one (1) year terms, subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City authorities.  This ordinance authorizes the fourth and final year of the four (4) allowable renewals/extensions.  \n \nThe ordinance also authorizes the Technology Director to renew a separate agreement and establish a purchase order with Mythics, Inc., utilizing State Term Schedule Contract - STS-033, #534570, with an expiration date of June 30, 2021 for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition, Diagnostics and Tuning Packs, software licensing, maintenance and support services, with a term period of June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2022, for a total cost of $7,521.33. This contract was authorized under Ordinance No. 1874-2018 passed July 16, 2018.  The contract was most recently renewed by the authority of Ordinance No. 1020-2020, passed on through purchase order PO232117.  Mythics, Inc. is the designated Oracle reseller of Oracle licensing services and products offering the lowest pricing via the State of Ohio STS.  It is in the best interest of the City to acquire these services (licensing maintenance and support and training) from the STS compared to open market pricing which is at a higher cost.\n \nOracle software is a critical component of a number of citywide business systems including 311, CUBS, Income Tax, WAM, and GIS. These critical business functions would be impacted without this renewal.  The software is server-based and has given the City the capability to web-enable applications for citizens' use and ensure compliance with licensing agreements.  Oracle software is one of the fastest, most scalable and reliable databases in the industry providing a feature rich platform for business process implementation.  Oracle is the database engine behind multiple applications in the City of Columbus. \n \nThe total amount of funding requested via this ordinance is $780,224.27 for all currently held Oracle software licensing, maintenance and support within the Department of Technology.  \n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:    \nIn fiscal years 2019 and 2020, $730,113.24 and $757,787.60 were expended respectively for Oracle annual software licensing, training, maintenance and support services.  The total cost for the 2021 contract for these services is $780,224.27.  Funding is available and approved within the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating fund and the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating fund (Direct Charge budget).  Including this renewal, the aggregate Oracle contracts total amount is $3,660,351.88.\n \nEMERGENCY:  \nEmergency designation is being requested for this renewal to continue with services that are necessary to support daily operation activities and to ensure no service interruption.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:   \nVendor Name:  Mythics, Inc.
