    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Office of CelebrateOne has been awarded a grant from Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services (FCDJFS).This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $800,000.00 in grant monies for (1) communication and marketing campaigns designed to encourage safe sleep practices and raise awareness of maternal infant health issues; (2) neighborhood initiatives focused on teen reproductive health education; and (3) safe sleep kits and cribs for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024.  \n \nOn average, one baby dies every other week in Franklin County due to unsafe sleep practices. Many of these deaths could be prevented by following the ABCs of infant safe sleep - that babies should sleep Alone, on their Backs, and in an empty Crib, every night, every nap, every time. The allocated funding will help in the efforts to reduce sleep related deaths in Franklin County through an educational marketing campaign, to fund the Columbus Health Department’s Cribs for Kids program which distributes cribs for families in need, and to implement neighborhood initiatives focused on teen reproductive health education.\n \nThe Safe Sleep Media contract in the amount of $330,000.00 will develop a culturally-informed media advertising campaign that promotes safe sleep practices and increase awareness regarding maternal and infant health equity. The need for these services were advertised through Bonfire (RFQ025165) and the City’s Vendor Portal according to competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code.  Nine (9) proposals were received and scored by an evaluation committee.  Proposals were received from Digital Amplification, Third Street Digital, WeUsThem Inc., Purplegator Inc., Digital Ignite, Triumph Communications, Paul Werth Associates, Canvaas Consulting, and The Saunders Group.  All nine proposals were reviewed and scored by an evaluation committee.  The committee determined that Purplegator Inc. was the best firm to produce the educational marketing campaign.\n \nThe Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio sub-award agreement in the amount of $150,000.00 will continue a community-based peer-to-peer education program for teens to develop healthy lifestyles and responsible choices by adolescents. Peer educators will receive training and incentives to increase their knowledge of essential, evidence based sexual health information, establish important leadership skills and gain confidence to engage their peers and larger community in vital conversations. \n \nThe Nationwide Children’s Hospital sub-award agreement in the amount of $250,000.00 will support the CelebrateOne goal to improve reproductive health planning by implementing evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programming in schools. The continuation of this program has been ongoing since 2019 within Columbus City Schools.  \n \nColumbus Public Health Department is a sub-award partner within this grant and will encumber up to $70,000.00 to purchase cribs for distribution through the Cribs for Kids Program.  \n \nNationwide Children’s Hospital DAX# 006069 | Non Profit\nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Ohio DAX# 027518 | Non Profit\nPurplegator LLC DAX # 041414 | MAJ | CC Exp. 3/7/2025\nCribs for Kids Inc.
