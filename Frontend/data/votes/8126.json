This modification is necessary to add the TASER branded conducted energy device and associated accessories to the current contract. These items are used throughout the Division of Police. When deployed, the TASER conducted energy device will automatically turn on a police officer’s body camera. The Division previously purchased the TASER equipment from a State contract that is no longer available.

The vendor, Axon Enterprises Inc., provided a quote to the Public Safety Directors office for evaluation and approval of the use of the TASER equipment.
