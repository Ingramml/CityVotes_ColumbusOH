    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Conference of Mayors (USCM) announced the 2024 cycle for its Childhood Obesity Prevention/Environmental Health and Sustainability Awards.  The application deadline was initially September 15, 2023, and it was extended until September 29, 2023.\n \nSince 2012, the Childhood Obesity Prevention/Environmental Health and Sustainability Awards - a partnership between The United States Conference of Mayors and the American Beverage Association for a Healthy America (ABFHA) - has awarded nearly $6 million to cities of all sizes across the country to support programs that aim to improve the health and wellness of the nation’s children, families, neighborhoods, and cities.  A total of $745,000 in funding will be awarded to nine cities, in three population categories: Small City (population less than 75,000); Medium City (population 75,000-250,000) and Large City (population more than 250,000).  This award aims to support programs that engage community members and promote or stimulate behavior change, in the categories of: a) childhood obesity prevention; b) environmental health and sustainability or; c) a hybrid of both.  \n \nChildhood Obesity Prevention Initiatives including: increasing kids’ and families’ access to fresh fruits and vegetables, through the development of school and community gardens, and/or programs that support farmers’ markets and/or free or low-cost fruit and vegetable distribution in affected communities; cooking and nutrition programs that focus on teaching kids how to eat better and/or how to prepare healthy meals; programs that encourage kids to exercise in and out of school; and programs that empower youth to engage in educating their peers and in the community decision-making process about issues that directly impact their health and wellbeing. Environmental Health and Sustainability Initiatives included: strategies to encourage and improve residential recycling rates and reduce contamination; food waste reduction initiatives, composting and other waste/landfill diversion programs; beach/waterway and other types of community clean-up initiatives; projects that promote water conservation; projects that develop parks, and other open spaces; and projects that promote alternative transportation options, such as bike paths, and/or enhance neighborhood walkability for residents.  All member cities of The United States Conference of Mayors are eligible to receive this award, including service cities.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to apply for this funding to support the Department of Public Service’s (DPS’) food waste and recycling initiatives.  DPS’ Division of Refuse Collection has recently expanded its recycling and food waste diversion programs.  This application is seeking funding to help construct five additional food scrap drop-off sites, purchase equipment for the two Waste and Reuse Convenience Centers, and expand the educational and outreach efforts to residents on recycling, composting, and litter reduction throughout Columbus.  This legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally apply for a Childhood Obesity Prevention/Environmental Health and Sustainability Award.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USMC or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nNo financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to apply for Childhood Obesity Prevention/Environmental Health and Sustainability Award from the United States Conference of Mayors; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Conference of Mayors providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus Department of Public Service; and to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Conference of Mayors (USCM) announced the 2024 cycle for its Childhood Obesity Prevention/Environmental Health and Sustainability Awards; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City has submitted a grant application intending to help construct five additional food scrap drop-off sites, purchase equipment for the two Waste and Reuse Convenience Centers, and expand the educational and outreach efforts to residents on recycling, composting, and litter reduction throughout Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the award funding; and NOW, THEREFORE \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking funding from the USCM’s 2024 cycle for its Childhood Obesity Prevention/Environmental Health and Sustainability Awards.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to accept said grants, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 4.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements. \n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
