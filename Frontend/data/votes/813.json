    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes establishing a purchase order with Insight Public Sector in the amount of $18,075.00 to pay two outstanding invoices. This is to partially replace purchase order PO205207, confirmed on December 16th, 2019 in the amount of $234,000.00. This purchase order was erroneously canceled with a balance of $91,350.00. Since, at the time of cancellation, there were pending invoices totaling $18,075.00, there is a need to establish a purchase order to enable payment.\n \nIn July of 2019, the department established an agreement, through state term schedule #STS 534242 with Insight Public Sector via purchase order PO180003 in the amount of $19,950.00.  This initial agreement provided 133 hours of consulting services at a fixed rate of $150.00 per hour for a term beginning on July 3rd, 2019 and ending on July 2nd, 2020. This initial agreement was then modified by ordinance 2816-2019. This ordinance added 1,560 hours to the agreement at a fixed cost of $150.00 for a total of $234,000.00.\n \nFollowing passage of the above-mentioned ordinance, purchase order PO205207 was established. This purchase was erroneously canceled before all invoices were paid. Thus, there is a need to establish a purchase order to allow for payment of these invoices.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $18,075.00 to pay two outstanding invoices, as described above.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor name: Insight Public Sector\nDAX vendor Account #: 007309\nContract Compliance #: 36-3949000   Expiration 9-22-2022      \n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and budgeted in the Information Services Operating Fund for the purpose stated above. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested on this ordinance as the referenced invoices are past due.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the establishment of a purchase order with Insight Public Sector in the amount of $18,075.00, to partially replace PO205207 that was canceled in error, to pay two outstanding invoices from Insight Public Sector totaling $18,075.00, to authorize the expenditure of $18,075.00 for the above referenced purpose from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund, and to declare an emergency ($18,075.00) \n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, purchase order PO205207, resulting from passage ordinance 2816-2019, was canceled in error; and\n \nWHEREAS, there were invoices pending against the above-mentioned purchase order when it was canceled; and\n \nWHEREAS, to pay the pending invoices, the Department of Technology desires to establish a new purchase order; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the establishment of a purchase order to enable payment of invoices that were pending against purchase order PO205207, which was canceled in error before the invoices could be paid, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property and safety and welfare, now therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
