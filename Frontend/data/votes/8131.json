    "description": "EXPLANATION:  This ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission (Commission) to modify and increase the contract with Anderson Reporting Services, Inc. (Anderson) for court reporting services, and to declare an emergency.\n \nBACKGROUND:  Because nearly all available, appropriated, funding for Anderson’s services has been paid out, the Civil Service Commission needs to request authority to modify and increase the Commission's current contract maximum authorized expenditure with Anderson, in accordance with City Code Section 329.09.  The modification and increase are necessary now to ensure funding is available for the historical recording of regular commission and trial board meetings as mandated via the City Charter and Commission Rules into 2024, prior to the adoption of the 2024 City budget.\n \nThe Commission executed a contract on March 16, 2023, with Anderson for court reporting services with a maximum obligation of $5,500.00 through February 29, 2024.  As a result of the number of appeals filed to date that required a hearing, appropriated funding has been reduced to just over $1,800.00.  In order to cover potential needed services through the end of 2023 and into 2024, and in accordance with City Code Section 329.09 regarding modification and renewals of a current contract, the Commission is requesting to modify the end date of the Anderson contract from February 29, 2024 to May 31, 2024, and to increase and authorize the maximum obligation by $3,000.00 to the current $5,500.00 for a new total contract appropriation of $8,500.00.\n \nBid Information:  Since the initial, anticipated need for court reporting services was expected to be no more than $5,500.00 for the year, potential vendors were contacted informally for typical services provided and their associated cost (hourly rate for in-person attendance at the scheduled meeting, per page rate for transcription services, etc.).  Based on the information gathered, our review staff determined Anderson to be the best provider of the quality and feasibility of vendor feedback, cost, competence, ability, past performance, and timeliness of reporting results.  Therefore, the Commission awarded the contract to Anderson for court reporting services beginning March 1, 2023.  \n \nBecause the total maximum obligation remains well under the threshold for formal bidding, and because Anderson is offering the needed services at the same costs identified in the original contract, the Commission wishes to extend the end date of the contract and increase the maximum obligation without further informal bidding.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested in order to allow for the extension and increase of the contract immediately for the historical recording of regular commission and trial board meetings as mandated via the City Charter and Commission Rules through the end of 2023 and into 2024.\n \nContract Compliance Number:  CC-005365, expires March 11, 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these services was budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2023 General Fund budget. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the current contract with Anderson Reporting Services, Inc. for court reporting services to extend the contract end date to May 31, 2024 and increase the contract amount; to authorize the expenditure of $3,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($3,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2023, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission awarded a contract to Anderson Reporting Services, Inc. (\"Anderson\") for court reporting services based upon informal cost solicitations; and\n \nWHEREAS, as of March 1, 2023, $5,500.00 had been authorized to Anderson for the provision of court reporting services in 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS the current contract is potentially insufficient to pay for upcoming services needed to provide court reporting services for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024, and it is therefore now necessary to modify and increase the value of the current contract with Anderson Reporting Services, Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to allow for the provision of court reporting services to comply with the Commission's obligations under the Columbus City Codes; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be, and is hereby, authorized to modify and increase the current contract with Anderson Reporting Services, Inc. to extend the contract date to May 31, 2024, and increase the contract amount by $3,000.00, for the purpose of providing court reporting services for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $3,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
