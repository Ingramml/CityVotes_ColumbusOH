    "title": "To authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; to authorize the additional expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. (Mount Carmel) by increasing the maximum authorized expenditure for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police and Fire Academy classes. \n \nThe Civil Service Commission needs to request authority to modify and increase our current contract maximum authorized expenditure with Mount Carmel in order to add funds for upcoming medical screening services.  The modification and increase is necessary as funding is added annually and/or prior to a scheduled academy class, based upon available academy positions identified as the year progresses, to avoid encumbering City funds prematurely or unnecessarily.  For this fourth modification (three increases in maximum authorized expenditure and one to update exhibit A - 2738-2023) in 2023, we are requesting an increase of $100,000.00 to the current $310,000.00, previously authorized, for a new total contract appropriation of $410,000.00.\n \nSince this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process (see below), the contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes.  Pricing for the additional assessments is in accordance with bid pricing previously submitted by Mount Carmel for 2023-26 services.\n \nBid Information: In 2022, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ023538) for these services and accepted proposals through December 2, 2022. Three proposals were submitted by the deadline.  An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFQ and the Executive Director selected and executed a contract with the selected vendor, Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., via Ordinance 3084-2022 followed by a first modification via Ordinance 0776-2023.  Because the resulting contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. is valid through 2026, if renewed by the City, re-bidding for these services at this time is not required or needed.  Pricing for these services were determined via the RFQ process and were subsequently memorialized in the contract with the vendor. \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested in order to increase the contract immediately so that needed medical assessment services can be funded and completed for police and fire academy classes scheduled for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024.\n \nContract Compliance Number: CC-005227, expires 09/21/2025. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this wave of services is budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s 2023 General Fund budget. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify and increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; to authorize the additional expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the contract to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. based upon the submissions of RFQ023538; and\n \nWHEREAS, Three Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($310,000.00) have been previously authorized to Mount Carmel Health Providers for the pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits services per Ordinances 3084-2022, 0776-2023, 2041-2023, and 2738-2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to modify and increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to increase the contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to modify and increase the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. for the purpose of administering pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress tests to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2. That the additional expenditure of $100,000.00 (for a new total authorization of $410,000.00 to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc.), or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor be and is hereby authorized to establish an Auditor's Certificate on behalf of the Civil Service Commission for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these expenditures are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City’s financial records.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
