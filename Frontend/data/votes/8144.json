    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management on behalf of the Fleet Management Division to purchase three (3) 24 V DC Engine Starters from Genuine Parts Company (Genuine Parts Co (NAPA). These machines will be utilized by the Department of Finance, Fleet Management Division for the repair and consistent operation of vehicles for use throughout the city. RFQ026087 closed on 10/20/2023. There were five (5) bidders and the award was given to Genuine Parts Co (NAPA). After evaluation Genuine Parts Co (NAPA)’s bid came out to being the lowest and best bid response to bid specifications, length of warranty and available delivery date: \n \nGenuine Parts Co (NAPA)   - $28,377.81\nBusiness Bay LLC. - $33,445.50\nTarazi LLC - $34,398.00\nPlanet Holding Inc. - $31,470.00\nRose K Erich. - $31,299.63\n \nGenuine Parts Co (NAPA) certification number CC-009445\n \nFiscal Impact: A total of $28,377.81 will be spent from the Fleet Management G.O. Debt Fund 5205. Amendments to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and transfers of cash within Fund 5205 will be necessary to align budget authority and cash with the proper projects. \n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing machinery to increase in cost as well as limit their availability and produce unacceptably long lead times. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that Fleet Management may ensure the pending purchase and delivery of this machinery.\n  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to purchase three (3) 24 V DC Engine Starters from Genuine Parts Company (NAPA); to authorize expenditure of $28,377.81 from the Fleet G.O.
