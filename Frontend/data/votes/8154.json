    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Roadway Improvements ‐ Sancus Boulevard Widening project.\nOrdinance 2406-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc. for the Roadway Improvements ‐ Sancus Boulevard Widening project.  The project consists of the design of street improvements to Sancus Boulevard from Worthington Woods Boulevard to Lazelle Road. Improvements include pavement widening to add a center turn lane where necessary, pavement rehabilitation, shared use path, sidewalk, traffic signal replacements, and street lighting. Additionally, the project consists of the design for a new shared use path along the west side of Sancus Boulevard from Lakeview Plaza Boulevard/Worthington‐Galena Road to Worthington Woods Boulevard.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,498,509.06.\n \nOrdinance 2534-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to submit MORPC Attributable Funds roadway improvement project applications and execute project agreement for funding within the Transportation Improvement Program for the Roadway Improvements ‐ Sancus Blvd Widening project.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended:                      $1,498,509.06\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $   800,000.00                     (PO295353, Ord. 2406-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,498,509.06                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $2,298,509.06  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to allow additional resources to complete the design process.  The amount initially legislated for this project did not include the full amount that would be needed to fund this project through final design and construction services.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis is a planned modification to allow for additional work as funds became available.  The amount being requested is for the consultant and project team to complete final design phases including bidding and construction services. It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Kimley Horn and Associates, Inc. is CC024725 and expires 2/1/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $998,509.06 is available in the Polaris Interchange Fund, Fund 7770, for this project.  It is necessary to transfer and appropriate funds within Fund 7770 to align spending with the proper project.  \n \nThe remaining funding in the amount of $500,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704 within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds and appropriation are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to meet the deadlines for the federal funding, meet the requirements of the grant, and to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund and the Polaris Interchange Fund; to appropriate funds within the Polaris Interchange Fund; to authorize the transfer of funds between projects within the Polaris Interchange Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. for the Roadway Improvements ‐ Sancus Blvd Widening project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,498,509.06 from the Polaris Interchange Fund and the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,498,509.06) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
