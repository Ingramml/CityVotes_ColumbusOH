    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Builderscape, Inc. for the West Franklinton Parks Project. The contract amount is $1,306,240.50, with a contingency of $129,759.50, for a total of $1,436,000.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,438,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department Land Plan shows that West Franklinton is the most underserved community in Columbus for parks and recreation facilities per capita. A mere 10.8 acres of parkland exists in an inner city community of over 9,000 residents. To address some of this need, this project will install selected recreation improvements for the medians. These areas comprise almost 6.5 acres of public greenspace.  Over 6,000 residents live adjacent to or within a short walk from the designated medians. \n \nSince 2017, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department has been collaborating with the Department of Development and engaging with the Franklinton community on the potential of activating these greenspaces. This project will enhance these medians by providing additional walking paths, shelters, and perimeter controls. The improvements will also include playgrounds, park benches, picnic tables, and additional landscaping. \n \nConstruction is anticipated to be complete in Fall 2024.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on September 7, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on October 12, 2023.
