    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the existing contracts with CK Construction Group, Inc. (\"CK Construction Group\") for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $5,730,912.00 for the CK Construction Group contract. \n \nKilbourne Run Sports Park, located at 4625 Westerville Road, is a soccer specific facility that stretches over 62 acres with 35 of those acres dedicated to athletic space. The park currently contains 16 fields of various sizes, gravel parking lots, an existing shelter, a two story vacant commercial building, as well as, a building used for concessions and storage. Recreation and Parks is updating Kilbourne Run Sports Park to include prime fields and facilities that will increase access to soccer and other field sports for the Columbus Community. This will position Columbus as a destination for regional tournaments. The Recreation and Parks Department previously entered into contract with DLZ Ohio to complete design services and to aid the Department in project delivery. Design will continue through spring of 2024. The work on site is scheduled to begin in spring 2024 and it is the intent that the improved Kilbourne Run Sports Park will open in the spring of 2025. \n \nThis is a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) Contract.  This delivery method will save the project money and time compared to a traditional Design Bid Build delivery. This is one of three planned modifications for the project's guaranteed maximum price. This modification will cover costs for site clearing and demolition. It will also cover procurement of long lead time items such as HVAC equipment, a traffic signal, and electrical equipment. \n \nThis modification was foreseen due to the nature of the CMAR contracts. The modification fee was determined by the CMAR's lowest and best bid results from the scoped subcontracted work. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCK Construction Group\n6245 Westerville Road\nWesterville, Ohio 43081\nJames Negron, (614) 901-8844\nContract Compliance Number: 006875 \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: August 23, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to address the immediate need to secure long lead time supply chain items and minimize the escalation of costs for construction materials. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the soccer amenities and outdoor sports programs the City can offer to the public. Additionally, these improvements set the City of Columbus up to be a major destination for soccer programs and tournaments for all levels of play.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Input for this project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports, and Leisure International (CSL) and managed by the Recreation and Parks Department in the summer of 2021. Input was also received by internal Recreation and Parks stakeholders and the Mayor’s Office. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northland (35)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by addressing the need to update five neighborhood parks per year and updating sports related parks to keep them in line with the revenue that they produce.\n \nFiscal Impact: $70,276.54 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7712 to meet the obligations of part of this contract. The remainder of the funding for this project, in the amount of $5,660,635.46, is budgeted within the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget. The funds will not be available to Recreation and Parks until the proceeds of the 2023-2024 bond sale are available at a future date. Therefore, it is necessary to certify the required funds, in the amount of $5,660,635.46, against the Special Income Tax Fund 4430. Upon the sale of bonds, this will be reimbursed. \n \nThe expenditure of $29,475.00 was legislated for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvement Project by Ordinance 1801-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $5,730,912.00. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $5,760,387.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the existing contract with CK Construction Group, Inc. for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project; to authorize the transfer of $5,660,635.46 between the Special Income Tax and the Recreation and Parks Bond Funds; to authorize the transfer of $70,276.54 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $5,730,912.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
