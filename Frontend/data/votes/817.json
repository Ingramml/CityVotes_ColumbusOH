    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND  \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects (Gannett Fleming) for the Roadway Improvements - Lazelle Road project.  This is a planned modification and the seventh modification to the original contract.  \n \nThe scope of work for the original contract and first modification focused on improving Lazelle Road from a point west of Flint Road to Sancus Boulevard and included improvements to the intersections of Lazelle Road at Flint Road and South Old State Road and replacement of the railroad underpass.  This project is known as Lazelle Road - Phase B. \n \nThe Department of Public Service applied for and received MORPC Attributable Funds (federal funds) in early 2013 to improve areas adjacent to the portion of Lazelle Road described above.  The portion of Lazelle Road west of Phase B, from N. High Street to a point west of Flint Road where Phase B began, is known as Phase A.  Phase C is to the east, from Sancus Boulevard to Worthington-Galena Road.  The City will receive over $27 million in federal funds for all phases of improvements to the Lazelle Road corridor from N. Nigh Street to Worthington-Galena Road.\n \nThe second modification expanded the scope of work to encompass phases A and C.  Those improvements included pavement resurfacing and reconstruction, widening with the addition of lanes as needed, installation of sidewalk along the south side and a shared use path along the north side, installation of curb and gutter, and stormwater infrastructure improvements.\n \nThe third modification allowed for the continuation of previously authorized work and additions to the scope of services, including the preparation of plans for phases A and C of the Lazelle Road project, potentially enabling the future construction of all three phases to proceed as a single project. \n \nThe fourth modification allowed for continuation of phase B plan changes due to requirements to meet railroad criteria that were not known at the beginning of the project.  Scope additions included stormwater drainage modifications based on the preliminary engineering study due to updated drainage calculations, design of a temporary railroad bridge, and waterway determination package and permits.  Deliverables included stage 3 plans, backcheck plans, final plans, cost estimates, waterway determination package, preconstruction notifications, and Ohio Environmental Protection Services Notice of Intent.\n \nThe fifth modification allowed for continuation of design services and added funds for additional consultant related services. \n \nThe sixth modification occurred prior to construction to add funds for additional consultant related services that may be needed to resolve problems that occur during construction.\n \nThis seventh, planned modification is to allow for continued design services during construction for the consultant and railroad design coordination.\n \nOriginal contract amount:                                           $   900,000.00 (Ord. 2120-2011, EL012427)\nModification 1 amount:                                                                $1,100,000.00 (Ord. 2274-2012, EL013728)\nModification 2 amount:                                                                 $   250,000.00 (Ord. 1766-2013, EL015098)\nModification 3 amount:                                             $   681,065.64 (Ord. 1637-2014, EL016072)\nModification 4 amount:                                                               $   186,087.52 (Ord. 1731-2016, PO023183)\nModification 5 amount:                                                               $    40,000.00 (Ord. 1937-2018, PO136173)\nModification 6 amount:                                                               $    67,000.00 (Ord. 2090-2019, PO185695)\nModification 7 amount:                                                               $    50,000.00 (this ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount, including all modifications: $3,274,153.16.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance for Gannett Fleming is CC001829 and expires 1/16/22.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this project is available in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, in an amount of up to $50,000.00.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align spending with the proper project.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow for the Department of Public Service to make funding for the design of this project available and allow the project schedule to proceed.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget;
