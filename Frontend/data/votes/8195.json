    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance amends Title 11, Chapter 1163 Municipal Electric Rates, Sections 1163.12 Private area lighting (overhead) and 1163.125 Private area lighting (underground) of the Columbus City Codes. \n \nThe proposed amendments establish billing rates for light emitting diode (LED) luminaires for overhead and underground private area lighting. Non-LED luminaires, such as metal halide (MH), high- and low-pressure sodium (LPS and HPS, respectively), and mercury vapor (MV), are being eliminated and not available for new installations. As such, the proposed amendments align City Codes with current technology and Division of Power operations. The proposed amendments also permit and establish separate monthly charges for when additional installation costs are required.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNewer LED luminaires are more efficient and may reduce monthly revenue received by the Division of Power. Conversely, this may be offset as the costs of LEDs are higher than for non-LED alternatives.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend various sections of Title 11, Chapter 1163 Municipal Electric Rates, of the Columbus City Codes to establish billing rates for light emitting diode (LED) luminaires for overhead and underground private area lighting.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend various sections of Title 11, Chapter 1163 Municipal Electric Rates, of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1163.12 to establish monthly billing rates for LED luminaires for overhead private area lighting; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1163.125 to establish monthly billing rates for LED luminaires for underground private area lighting and charges for each additional pole needed; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, Division of Power, to amend the various sections listed above; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Sections 1163.12 and 1163.125 are hereby amended as follows: \n \n                     SEE ATTACHMENT - ORD 2989-2023 OVERHEAD AND UNDERGROUND PRIVATE AREA LIGHTING CITY CODE CHANGE - CHAPTER 1163.\n \nSECTION 2. That existing Sections 1163.12 and 1163.125 are hereby repealed.\nSECTION 3. That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
