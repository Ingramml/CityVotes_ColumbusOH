    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to re-establish funding for purchase orders issued from a Universal Term Contract (UTC) that has been previously established by the Purchasing Office.\n \nMike Albert Leasing, Inc. vendor#0214442, PA002701 - Electric Vehicles UTC - expired 9/30/2019 - ($1,231,327.29 estimated)\n \nOrdinance 1556-2019 authorized the Director of Finance and Management to establish purchase orders with Mike Albert Fleet Solutions for the acquisition of fifty-eight (58) battery electric and plug in hybrid electric vehicles as part of the Smart City program, for use by various City of Columbus Departments and Divisions.  The Fleet Management Division was authorized to purchase and place into service 11 Kia NIRO, 22 Nissan Leaf and 25 Toyota Prius vehicles. Placement of these units was to meet and/or exceed the Mayor’s Green Fleet Action Plan by further reducing harmful carbon emissions and Green House Gases in Central Ohio and is in accordance with the commitments to the Smart City Program.\n \nThe Department of Public Service set up two (2) Purchase Orders to procure a total of seven (7) Nissan Leafs - three (3) for the Division of Design and Construction (DODC), and four (4) for the Parking Services Division (PSD):\n \nPO180446-1                      $70,623.90                      DODC \nPO180313-1                     $94,165.20                     PSD \n \nTotal:                                          $164,789.10\n \nAll the Nissan Leafs for both Divisions were received and put into use by the City’s Fleet Management Division, and currently are in use by the Department of Public Service.  Unfortunately, due to the City’s year end Purchase Order cleanup process, both purchase orders were cancelled.  This error removed the remaining funds encumbered by the purchase orders and closed the purchase orders, making them unusable for paying invoices.  It is necessary to re-encumber funds in the amount of $77,821.00, the balance that should still be available on the cancelled purchase orders, and issue a new purchase order for this amount so the invoices still owed to Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. can be paid.  \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. is expired and Mike Albert Leasing, Inc. will need to update their vendor profile before issuance of the purchase order.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this expenditure is available within Fund 2241 (Private Construction Inspection Fund) and Fund 5518 (Public Construction Inspection Fund).  \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow invoices that have been put on-hold due to the financial system error to be paid as soon as possible.                     \n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the Private Construction Inspection Fund and the Public Construction Inspection Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to re-establish funding for a necessary purchase order; to authorize the expenditure of up to $23,346.00 from the Private Construction Inspection Fund and $54,475.00 from the Public Construction Inspection Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($77,821.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service is engaged in the meeting and/or exceeding the Mayor’s Green Fleet Action Plan by further reducing harmful carbon emissions and Green House Gases in Central Ohio;
