    "description": "Explanation   \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with CDM Smith Inc. for professional engineering services for the Stormwater Remote Site Communication Network Upgrades project, C.I.P. Number 611661-100000, in an amount up to $97,757.00; and the Sanitary Remote Site Communication Network Upgrades project, C.I.P. Number 650661-100000, in an amount up to $320,881.00, for a total of $418,638.00. \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities (DPU), Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) has 95 sites that require monitoring and in some cases, control. DOSD utilizes a network system of radios and repeaters for communication and control of stormwater and sanitary sites. These systems also inform maintenance staff of any problems at these sites. Interrupted control or communication could potentially cause operational challenges which could contribute to Water-In-Basement (WIB) events or overflows to area streams and rivers. These sites include five stormwater remote sites and 23 sanitary remote sites. Some remote sites are large enough to have PLC-based monitoring and control which includes biofilters, stream gauges, gate structures, and floodwall structures. Smaller remote sites such as flow meters and level sensors utilize battery powered sensors, solar power, or above grade antennas. \n \nThe existing radio hardware at many of DOSD’s stormwater and sanitary sites is approaching the end of their useful life or have become obsolete and replacement parts are no longer available. Many of these sites also have a need for electrical improvements, PLC upgrades, component lifecycle replacement, and radio quality improvements.\n \nThe purpose of these projects is to evaluate and plan the needed upgrades for the DOSD radio network systems; to evaluate, identify, and address the necessary communication needs specific to DOSD's remote sites; and ensure that each of the remote sites continue to be an integral part of DOSD's stormwater and sanitary collection systems.  \n \nPlanning Area: 99 - Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE & FUTURE RENEWAL(S):  \nCDM Smith will begin work after the Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given upon execution of their Professional Engineering Services Agreement. NTP is anticipated to be in early 2024. The engineering agreement will provide Step 1, Preliminary Design Services. The completion of Preliminary Design and approval of a Preliminary Design Report (PDR) is currently scheduled for the second quarter of 2025. A modification request for Detailed Design is currently scheduled for the first quarter of 2025 so that the modification can be finalized and Detailed Design can begin upon completion of Preliminary Design. Detailed Design will continue until advertisement for bids, then bidding services will commence. It is anticipated that plans and specs will be finalized and ready for advertisement by the second quarter of 2026, bids will be received in the second quarter of 2026, and Notice to Proceed of the construction contract will be in the third quarter of 2026. The anticipated end of the construction contract is the first quarter of 2028. The Professional Engineering Services contract will continue beyond completion of construction to provide record drawings of the constructed facilities and to provide assistance during the warranty period. The term of the engineering agreement is estimated to be five years or when the contract tasks are completed to the satisfaction of the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:\nThe amount of the original engineering agreement for Preliminary Design will be as follows:\n \nCIP 611661-100000, Stormwater Remote Site Communication Network Upgrades:                           $97,757.00\nCIP 650661-100000, Sanitary Remote Site Communication Network Upgrades:                                           $320,881.00\nPRELIMINARY DESIGN TOTAL:                                                                                                                                                                       $418,638.00\n \nTwo additional contract modifications are anticipated at this time; one for Detailed Design and one for Engineering Services During Construction.\n \nCost Summary for CIP 611661-100000\n                     Original Engineering Agreement (for Preliminary Design)                                                                      $97,757.00\n                     Proposed Modification No. 1 (for Detailed Design and Bidding Services)                                 $130,000.00 \n                     Proposed Modification No. 2 (for Engineering Services during Construction)                      $152,000.00\n                       CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                                                 $379,757.00\n \nCost Summary for CIP 650661-100000\n                     Original Engineering Agreement (for Preliminary Design)                                                                        $320,881.00\n                     Proposed Modification No. 1 (for Detailed Design and Bidding Services)                                 $420,000.00 \n                     Proposed Modification No. 2 (for Engineering Services during Construction)                      $490,000.00\n                       CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                                                 $1,230,881.00\n \nCombined Cost Summary for CIPs 611661-100000 and 650661-100000\n                     Original Engineering Agreement (for Preliminary Design)                                                                        $418,638.00\n                     Proposed Modification No. 1 (for Detailed Design and Bidding Services)                                 $550,000.00 \n                     Proposed Modification No. 2 (for Engineering Services during Construction)                      $642,000.00\n                       CONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                                                                 $1,610,638.00 \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe performance of these projects’ activities to provide specialized professional engineering services to evaluate, identify, and address the necessary communication needs at DOSD's 95 sites is needed to ensure that each of the sites continue to be an integral part of DOSD's stormwater and sanitary collection systems. If left unperformed, interrupted control or communication could potentially cause operational challenges which could contribute to Water-In-Basement (WIB) events or overflows to area streams and rivers. \n \nNo community outreach is considered for this project.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nA Request for Proposals (RFP) was published on Bonfire and Vendor Services on June 30, 2023 through July 28, 2023.  One proposal was received.\n \nName                                                               C.C.
