    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. for the Short Circuit Coordination and Arc Flash Studies #1 contract, CIP #650260-100008, in an amount up to $350,000.00.\n \nThis project provides engineering services for short circuit, coordination, and arc flash studies.  This work includes field collection of all device and component ratings, settings, sizes, lengths, etc.; development of a model; providing the coordination settings to reduce incident arc flash energy; and affixing arc flash hazard labels to all equipment as required by OSHA.  \n \nDuring this renewal period the project will provide continuing support in these areas for all capital projects at the wastewater treatment plants, compost, and the pump stations. This will include reviewing short circuit analysis from other firms and integrating these models into the overall plant models.  The engineer will also provide services to recommend changes to electrical gear to improve short circuit coordination and arc flash behavior, including making setting changes on equipment. \n \nCommunity Planning Area:  99 City Wide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $350,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                  $1,000,000.00 (Ord. 2777-2018 PO152940)\nRenewal #1:                                                                                              $425,000.00 (Ord. 2313-2020 PO257092)\nRenewal #2:                                                                                $350,000.00 (Ord. 1716-2022 PO342531)\nModification #3:                                                                              $350,000.00 (Current) \nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):                                           $2,125,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis work was originally planned and established as a multi-year effort funded by periodic renewals because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them.  Bidding out this work would risk funding this substantial start-up effort again and would require the multi-year work to start again.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Hatch Associates and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will provide a safer working environment for plant personnel by updating arc flash rating nameplates required by OSHA and will reduce nuisance tripping of electrical equipment.\n \n3.
