    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. for the SWWTP Power System Upgrade and Safety Improvements contract, CIP #650357-100101, in an amount up to $720,000.00.\n \nThe original contract was for preliminary design services relating to arc flash hazards and coordination issues with electrical equipment at the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP). That portion of the project evaluated electrical equipment that needs replaced or rehabilitated and provided recommendations for replacement or rehabilitation.\n \nThis contract modification is the first of two planned modifications. This modification is for detailed design services to provide detailed design documents for the construction portion of the project.  It will also include bidding assistance services.  A future contract modification is planned to provide engineering services during construction.\n \nCommunity Planning Area: 99-Citywide\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $720,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                                                      $442,745.00 (Ord. 2938-2021 PO308106)\nModification  #1:                                                                               $720,000.00 (Current)\nFuture Modification #2:                                                                   $540,000.00  \nTotal:                                                                                  $1,702,745.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was bid with the intention of one company completing the entire project.  A modification is needed now because the initial funding established for the contract was just the amount needed to fund the preliminary contract work.  The preliminary design services were completed by Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc.  Hatch has intimate knowledge of the project scope and how the detailed design should proceed to address all the needs identified in the original contract.  Re-bidding the contract for the next phase of services would create a 4-6 month delay in the project, and be more expensive, as a new company would have to spend time, and charge the City, to review and recertify all work Hatch has completed to date.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Hatch Associates Consultants, Inc., and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will replace equipment that is past its useful life or that no longer meets the electrical loads required by the plant. Replacing this equipment will reduce the amount of maintenance required to keep the plant operational as well as reducing the number of electrical safety issues.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nHatch Associates Consultants Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC0025646 and expires 3/8/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hatch Associates Consultants Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of two sub-consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 40%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nCCI Engineering Services                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE                     \n \nThe certification of Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n 5.
