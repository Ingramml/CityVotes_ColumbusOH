    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing water and sewer contracts entered into with Franklin County on August 4, 2020.  Ordinance 0330-2020 authorized the City to contract with Franklin County for the purpose of allowing the County to make water and sewer service available to certain parcels in Perry Township, Franklin County, Ohio in furtherance of the City and Perry Township Annexation Agreement. The Annexation Agreement was entered into between the City and Perry Township on August 19, 2020 pursuant to Ordinance 0332-2020. The annexation agreement between Perry Township and the City was later modified on November 24, 2021 to adjust the boundaries of properties subject to the annexation agreement and eligible for water and sanitary sewer service without annexation to the City of Columbus. It is currently necessary to amend the existing contracts for water and sewer services between Franklin County and the City to adjust the boundaries of the Service Areas under those agreements to align with the adjusted boundaries of the Annexation Agreement, as modified.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There is no fiscal impact from the modification of the water and sewer contracts. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the existing water service contract and sewer service contract with Franklin County, Ohio, for the provision of water and sewer service to certain properties within Perry Township in order to adjust the boundaries of the service areas under those agreements to align with the adjusted boundaries of the existing annexation agreement between the City and Perry Township.
