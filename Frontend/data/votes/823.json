    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  \nOrdinance 1684-2016 authorized the Franklin County Municipal Court, Clerk of Court (\"Municipal Court Clerk\") to enter into three (3) year contracts, with three (3) consecutive one (1) year renewal options with Apelles, LLC, Capital Recovery Systems, Inc., Linebarger, Goggan, Blair & Sampson, LLP, and the Law Offices of Robert A. Schuerger Co., LPA for collection services for the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office.\n \nThis legislation authorizes an appropriation and expenditure of $508,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Municipal Court Clerk collection fund. This legislation also seeks authority for the Municipal Court Clerk to modify (by increasing) the current contracts in the amount of $148,000.00 and to enter into the third renewal year in the base amount of $360,000.00 with Apelles, LLC, Capital Recovery Systems, Inc., and Linebarger, Goggan, Blair & Sampson, LLP, for the provision of collection services. The total (modification plus base contract amount) totals $508,000.00.  These additional funds are needed due to an increase in collection services.\n \nThe contract is self-funding in that the percentage charged for collecting the receivables is added to the total debt collected, pursuant to ORC 2335.24, ORC 2335.19 and Ordinance 0130-2009, thereby negating costs to the City of Columbus for this service.    \n \nBid Information:\nThe Municipal Court Clerk's Office solicited formal competitive bids through Requests for Proposals (RFQ 001289) for collection services, in accordance with Columbus City Code 329. The Municipal Court Clerk’s Office received six (6) proposals.   The proposals were reviewed by a committee of three (3) and evaluated in accordance with the committee's criteria.  The committee selected the highest scored companies. In agreement with the committee, the Municipal Court Clerk awarded the bid to the collection companies.\n \nContract Compliance:\n \nApelles, LLC; Contract Compliance # 41-2104380; Expiration Date:
