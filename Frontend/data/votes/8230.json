Resolution 0182X-2022 and Resolution 0226X-2022 approved a prior expansion of the Big Darby West Broad Street NCA to include territory near the southeast corner of the intersection of West Broad Street and Alton Darby Creek Road to fulfill another developer’s obligations to the Big Darby Revenue Program. \n \nOrdinance 2636-2022 then rezoned ±42.22 acres of additional property along the east side of Alton Darby Creek Road north of West Broad Street located at approximately 400 Alton Darby Creek Road and identified as tax parcel ID 470-318353 (the “Developer Property”) owned by Redwood Galloway Alton Darby Creek Road OH P1 LLC (the “Owner”).
