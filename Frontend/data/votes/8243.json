    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes modifying and extending purchase orders PO231970 and PO336928 to allow for the continuation and completion of the Department of Public Utilities’ PragmaCad system upgrade. There are no additional funds associated with these extensions.

This purchase order was subsequently extended by Ordinance 2130-2021, which passed on November 1, 2021, and again by Ordinance 2759-2022, which passed on October 24, 2022. Purchase order PO336928 was established by Ordinance 1466-2022, which passed on June 13, 2022.
