    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the FRA-270-1.52 project, PID 105498.  \n \nThe aforementioned effort, which is slated to commence in the summer of 2024, encompasses various improvements including replacing the deck of bridge structures FRA-270-1.52 (Gantz Rd over I-270) and FRA-270-9.30 (McComb Rd over I-270), widening the bridge on Gantz Road to accommodate a shared use path, and providing space and grading for a future sidewalk on McComb Road. \n \nODOT will ask the City to approve final legislation for the project at a later date. At that time, the Director of Public Service shall seek Council approval to encumber and expend funds to support the local share of associated construction costs.  \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe local share of construction costs has yet to be determined as the preliminary cost estimate is still being finalized.
