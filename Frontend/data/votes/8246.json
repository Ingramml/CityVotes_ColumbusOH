    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and provide funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the FRA-3-19.92 (Westerville Rd) project, PID 106260.  \n \nThe aforementioned effort, which is slated to commence in the spring of 2024, encompasses various improvements to the stretch of SR-3 from Cleveland Avenue to SR-161, including resurfacing, pavement repairs, pavement widening, and bridge work. \n \nOrdinance 0526-2023, which passed on March 6, 2023, previously authorized Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the FRA-3-19.92 (Westerville Rd) project, PID 106260.  \n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to enable the Department of Public Service to satisfy its administrative and financial obligations related to that effort by authorizing: 1) the execution of a contribution agreement or other instrument, and any amendments or modifications thereto, between the Department of Public Services, acting through its director, and ODOT, and 2) the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $594,070.00 to support completion of the project. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of up to $594,070.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service to support the local share of estimated construction costs; however, the final cost to the City may vary based on the results of the competitive bidding process administered by ODOT. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient spending authority for the aforementioned expenditure.\n \n3.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nODOT is a political subdivision of the State of Ohio. As such, City of Columbus MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements are not applicable. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to execute and return the necessary contribution agreement along with the requisite payment to ODOT on or before December 7, 2023 in order to maintain the project schedule established by ODOT and to promote highway safety. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to provide funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the FRA-3-19.92 project, PID 106260; to authorize the expenditure of up to $594,070.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to support the aforementioned project; and to declare an emergency.
