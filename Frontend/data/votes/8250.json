    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with 2LMN, Inc., to add additional funds for design of the Intersection Improvements - Dublin-Granville Road at Ulry Road project.\nOrdinance 1528-2017 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with 2LMN, Inc., for the Intersection Improvements - Dublin-Granville Road at Ulry Road project.  The intent of this project is to widen Dublin-Granville Road for turn lanes (an eastbound left turn lane and potentially a westbound right turn lane) at the intersection with Ulry Road.   Ordinance 2825-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $400,000.00.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $10,000.00.\n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $10,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $  70,861.58     (PO078950, Ord. 1528-2017)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $400,000.00     (PO147064, Ord. 2825-2018)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                                    $  10,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                            $480,861.58  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to allow additional resources for bidding and construction services.  Additionally, it will allow for the setting of ROW pins. The original contract included these tasks but the funds were reallocated to cover unforeseen design tasks. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe original consultant is necessary in order to answer questions regarding design that may come up during construction.  It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against 2LMN, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for 2LMN, Inc., is CC015414 and expires 10/10/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $10,000.00 is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highway Bonds Fund.  It is necessary to amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and to transfer cash to align budget authority with the proper project.  \n \n4.
