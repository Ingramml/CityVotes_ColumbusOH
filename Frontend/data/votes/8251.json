    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - North Knot-SR315.\nOrdinance 1912-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. for the Roadway - North Knot-SR315 project. The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, general engineering and transportation planning services for preliminary design services for improvements to State Route 315 (SR-315) and its exit or entrance ramps and interchanges between the SR-315 bridge (south of King Avenue) over the Olentangy River and Ackerman Road.  This project will be used to identify traffic capacity improvements to the freeway ramps and interchanges needed to support existing and planned development in the area. It will also be used to identify traffic capacity improvements to intersections in close proximity to the interchanges. \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $450,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $450,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $750,000.00     (PO341012, Ord. 1912-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $450,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $1,200,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to finalize traffic analysis of the alternatives developed out of the initial study phase and prepare elements of a feasibility study.  Additionally, the modification will provide funding to bring the study to a level of detail appropriate for applying for a Ohio Department of Transportation Major New Capacity Program federal grant.   \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThere is not enough time to complete the funding application deadline and bid out the work.  It was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Woolpert, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Woolpert, Inc. is CC001040 and expires 4/17/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $450,000.00 is available and appropriate within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds are necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \n4.
