    "description": "Background\n \nIn 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses. In responding to the call to action, the Department of Neighborhoods established the My Brother’s Keeper Village to be the hub of all work throughout the City of Columbus.\n \nThis legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $300,000.00 from the general operating dollars; Fund 1000; and authorizes the Director of Neighborhoods to enter into a grant agreement with Ours Brothers Keepers in an amount up to $300,000.00 to provide in-school and after-school academic based interventions. \n \nThe services included in this contract cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested to ensure that services are available for the remainder of the academic school year.\n \nFiscal Impact:  Funding is available within the general fund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \nOurs Brothers Keepers 045461 and is valid from 5/19/2023 to 5/19/2025\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreement with Ours Brothers Keepers in a total amount of up to $300,000.00 to provide in-school and after-school academic interventions; to authorize the expenditure of up to $300,000.00 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency. (300,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, MBK grants financially support programs that have shown success under the national My Brother’s Keeper Alliance six key life milestones that research shows are especially predictive for later success, and where interventions can have the greatest impact; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Mayor and City Council are committed to the mission and work of My Brother’s Keeper; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Neighborhoods in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a grant agreement with Ours Brothers Keepers to provide in school and after-school based interventions to ensure that services are available for the remainder of the academic school year, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1: That the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Ours Brothers Keepers to provide in-school and after-school based interventions in a total amount of up to $300,000.00 effective December 1, 2023.\n \nSECTION 2: That the expenditure of $300,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized in Fund 1000, Dept-Div 48-01, in object class 05 (Grants to Not for Profit Agencies) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3: That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4: That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 5: That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
