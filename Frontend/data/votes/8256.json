    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the not-for-profit Choice Network, Inc. d/b/a/ JustChoice, Inc., in support of their JustChoice Fund.\n \nChoice Network, Inc. (\"Choice\") is a not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to provide adoption services and support.  Funding will support the operations of the organization by providing needed funds for staffing, space, marketing, and supplies.  Choice does not provide any direct support for terminating a pregnancy; rather, it refers clients to other agencies who can provide that care.\n \nNo public funds shall be used to subsidize abortion procedures and associated services such as anesthesia, laboratory tests, or hospital services as proscribed by RC §§5101.55 and 5101.56.\n \nThe JustChoice Fund covers mutual aid to cover prohibitive expenses that cannot be paid by other forms of financial support. Examples include: 1) old rental debt that would have forced a family to forfeit their Section 8 housing opportunity, 2) a mattress that enabled a grandmother to move in and help care for the children, and 3) an Uber ride to drop kids at their grandparents’ house while their mother checked into a mental health facility.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to provide immediate assistance to individuals who are victims of human trafficking.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Choice Network, Inc. d/b/a/ JustChoice, Inc., in support of their JustChoice Fund; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
