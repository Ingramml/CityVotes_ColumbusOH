    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Kappa Foundation in support of the 14th Annual Turkey Giveaway.\n \nThe fundamental purpose of the Columbus Kappa Foundation is achievement, with a mission of service to the community. For the past 13 years, the Columbus Kappa Foundation has distributed thousands of turkeys and full meals, especially targeting residents in the 43293 and 43205 zip codes, areas with reduced access to healthy, affordable food. In the past 4 years, the Columbus Kappa Foundation has given out 3,150 turkeys and meals feeding an estimated 20,000 Columbus residents. In 2023, the goal will be to distribute 1,000 turkeys and meals to the community.\n \nColumbus City Council deems this expenditure and the distribution of food and meals to be a public purpose in that it helps to feed residents in underserved neighborhoods and who disproportionately experience food insecurity.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide the organization with the resources necessary to acquire and distribute during the holiday season.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus Kappa Foundation in support of the 14th Annual Turkey Giveaway; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
