    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to enter into contract with Abbas Consulting for professional and consulting services to assist the City of Columbus in becoming a Certified Welcoming City.\n \nThe Welcoming Standard is a comprehensive roadmap for communities to become more welcoming places. The Welcoming Standard sets criteria, or benchmarks, that local governments, community organizations, residents, and others can use to hold welcoming places accountable and spur innovation.\n \nStrong communities intentionally connect and include people of all backgrounds. As places look to harness the wealth and vibrancy that comes from diverse talents and a global workforce, truly welcoming places can set themselves apart. There are seven framework areas of the Welcoming Standard that define truly welcoming places: Civic Engagement, Connected Communities, Economic Development, Education, Equitable Access, Government and Community Leadership, and Safe Communities.\n \nAs of 2023, 18 cities and counties across the U.S. have been Certified Welcoming Communities. Abbas Consulting will help to coordinate and prepare for the Welcoming America President’s visit to Columbus and meet with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and other City of Columbus departments when necessary, will take place in the form of bi-weekly meetings.\n \nEmergency action is necessary to immediately begin the Welcoming City certification process.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion to enter into contract with Abbas Consulting for professional and consulting services to assist the City of Columbus in becoming a Certified Welcoming City; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
