    "description": "Explanation\nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every Columbus child has access to a safe after-school environment to continue his/her education at the end of the school day.\n \nAccording to the Harvard Family Research Project and its national database of evaluations, research confirms that “children and youth who participate in after-school programs can reap a host of positive benefits in a number of interrelated outcome areas: academic, social-emotional, prevention, and health and wellness. These are the skills that many suggest are necessary for youth to succeed in the 21st century global economy and world.”\n \nThe Mayor’s Office of Education is working with YMCA of Central Ohio, Columbus City Schools, the Boys and Girls Club of Central Ohio, and many others to develop a comprehensive, countywide, middle school after-school program collaborative for central Ohio.   The collaborative will track and measure output and outcomes to analyze the progress of youth, the effectiveness of programs, and how to expand strategically.  \n \nThe Office of Education requests the authority to partner with SureImpact Inc, a sole source vendor to provide a unified data collection and reporting infrastructure for the City, and for all of the after school programs in the collective.  SureImpact currently provides a similar service to the City of Columbus, Department of Development.  It will be advantageous to the city and to providers to cross reference the middle school data with that of the Department of Development’s Elevate grants.\n \nBecause SureImpact is a sole source provider, and because SureImpact currently provides a similar service to the City of Columbus, Department of Development, the Office of Education request to waive the competitive bidding requirement in City Code Section 329.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract ($57,625.00) is available within the 2023 Mayor’s Office of Education general fund budget. ($57,625.00)\nCC# 83-2597446 expires 10/14/2024\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education to enter into a contract with SureImpact, Inc. for the purposes of providing a unified data collection and reporting infrastructure for the Office’s Middle School After School Program; and to authorize the expenditure of $57,625.00 from the general fund.  ($57,625.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Mayor Ginther's vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every Columbus child has access to a safe after-school environment to continue their education at the end of the school day; and\n \nWHEREAS, research has proven that children who participate in after-school programs learn the skills that many suggest are necessary to succeed in the 21st century global economy and world; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Mayor’s Office of Education is working with Columbus City Schools, Boys and Girls Club of Central Ohio, the YMCA of Central Ohio; and many other providers on a comprehensive, countywide, middle school after-school program collaborative for central Ohio; and \n \nWHEREAS, SureImpact, Inc. will provide a unified data collection and reporting infrastructure for the city, and for all of the after-school programs in the collective; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Office request to waive competitive bidding as SureImpact is a sole source vendor and currently provides a similar service to the City of Columbus, Department of Development; and NOW THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
