    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Star House to assist them in meeting the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth. \n \nFounded in 2006, Star House operates the nation’s only 24/7 drop-in center for youth experiencing homelessness that hosts continuous best-practice research and is the only housing village of its kind in Central Ohio for college-age youth who are exiting homelessness. At central Ohio's only drop-in center, young people experiencing homelessness, ages 14-24, are provided with immediate access to safety, basic needs, and access to crucial, stabilizing resources.\n \nFunds from the City of Columbus Mayor’s Office of Education will support the wages of the Youth Advocates at the Star House Drop-In Center, a significant expense for a 24-hour per-day operation. This funding will make a meaningful impact in helping a large number of Columbus teens and young adults complete their education, escape homelessness, and become stable enough to thrive.\n \nThe needed services cannot be provided by existing city employees as the City does not operate a 24-hour per day drop-in center for youth experiencing homelessness.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this contract is available within the 2023 Mayor’s Office of Education general fund budget. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Education to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Star House, to assist them in meeting the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth, and to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the general fund. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Star House operates the nation’s only 24/7 drop-in center for youth experiencing homelessness that hosts continuous best-practice research and the only housing village of its kind in central Ohio for college-age youth who are exiting homelessness; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds from the City of Columbus Mayor’s Office will support Youth Advocates at the Star House Drop-In Center, helping them meet the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth; and \n \nWHEREAS, this funding will help a large number of Columbus teens and young adults complete their education, escape homelessness, and become stable enough to thrive; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Education is hereby authorized to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Star House to assist them in meeting the unique needs of homeless and housing-insecure high school and college-age youth.\n \nSECTION 2. That this agreement is awarded pursuant to the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes relating to the process for awarding not-for-profit service agreements.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $100,000.00 be and is hereby authorized as follows:\n \nDept/Div: 40-06 | Obj Class: 03 | Main Account: 63050 | Fund: 1000 | Sub-fund: 100010 | Program: ED001 | Amount: $100,000.00\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 5.
