These three circuits are to be converted to 14.4 kV by extending the existing 14.4 kV circuits in the same areas, as necessary, to serve all existing DOP customers on these 7,200 V circuits. The existing 7,200 V equipment shall be replaced as needed, including but not limited to transformers, switches, surge arresters, and other line equipment. These projects will also include circuit extensions and equipment installations to make the DOP power distribution system more robust and reliable upon project completion.\n \nThe work to be performed under the GPD contract includes project management, field survey, detailed design, preparation of construction drawings, obtaining permits necessary for the construction work, engineering services during construction, and preparation of record plan drawings.\n \n The Community Planning Area is 99 Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE:  The term of the contract will be until the conversion work is complete and accepted by the Division of Power, which is anticipated to be eight years, ending approximately December 2031.  The contract work is expected to be done in five phases as shown below:\n \nPhase 1 - January 2024 - December 2026\n                     Phase 2 - January 2025 - December 2027 \n                     Phase 3 - January 2026 - December 2028\n                     Phase 4 - January 2027 - December 2029\n                     Phase 5 - January 2028 - December 2031\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The initial contract amount will be for the Phase 1 amount of $586,042.00.  Future contract modifications will be necessary for services as needs dictate.  The estimated amounts needed for future contract phases and the estimated total contract amount are listed below.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Phase 1 (current)                                                          $586,042.00\n                     Phase 2                                                                                                    $650,000.00\n                     Phase 3                                                                                                    $700,000.00\n                     Phase 4                                                                                                   $750,000.00\n                     Phase 5                                                                                                    $800,000.00\nESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL   $3,486,042.00 \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will construct a more resilient and reliable power distribution system.  This will result in fewer power interruptions to the customers on these circuits, minimizing any economic impacts due to power outages.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and opened 9/29/23.   Two proposals were received:\nName                                                               C.C.
