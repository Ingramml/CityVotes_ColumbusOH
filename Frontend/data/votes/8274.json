    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to increase funding for Delaware County for sewer service provision during fiscal year 2023 according to an agreement entered into by the City of Columbus and Delaware County in 1991, authorized by Ordinance 2424-91. This agreement authorizes discharge of sewage from Delaware County into the sewer system of the City of Columbus and from the City of Columbus sewer system into the Delaware County sewer system in order to avoid duplication of wastewater treatment. A copy of the original agreement and a 2018 amendment and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are attached to this legislation. This agreement was amended by Ordinances 1418-2012 and 0961-2020, which altered the density allowances for certain areas to enhance development and modified certain flow monitoring and billing parameters, respectively.\n \nA previous ordinance - ORD 0071-2023 - authorized the payment of budgeted funds for fiscal year 2023. However, due to increasing trends in the number of billed gallons, as well as a rate increase of $0.00616 to $0.00635 per gallon, additional funds are needed to pay for the services.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nDelaware County | Federal EIN 31-6400065 | D365 Vendor #006181 | Governmental Organization\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \n$1,088,424.91 remains of the 2023-budgeted amount of $3,500,000.00 to pay the invoices for sewer service provision for quarters three and four.
