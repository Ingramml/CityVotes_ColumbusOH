    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with DLZ Ohio, Inc., for construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities construction projects bid during the calendar years 2023 through 2025 as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contracts. \n \nDLZ Ohio, Inc. will be assigned construction projects as tasks on their contract and will ensure the work is performed to City of Columbus construction standards and specifications.  As projects are added to the contract, the contract will be modified to authorize DLZ Ohio, Inc. to perform the work and to add funding to pay for the work.\n \nThe construction project to be administered by DLZ Ohio, Inc. under this contract modification is CIP #670895-100000 Noe-Bixby Road Street Lighting Improvements. The Noe-Bixby Road Street Lighting Improvements project will install lighting improvements that consist of the installation of LED Cobrahead style street lights with a new 3-wire electrical system.   \n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Community Planning Area “57 - Mid-East”.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $129,591.25\n                     Original Contract:       $725,135.69 (ORD 1768-2023 PO402691)\n                     Modification #1:       $1,191,867.05 (ORD 2111-2023 PO411979)\n                              Modification #2:       $1,822,179.64 (ORD 2942-2023)\n                              Modification #3:                           $129,591.25                      (current)\n                     Total                       $3,868,773.63\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025 for which modifications were anticipated pursuant to the original authorizing legislation under Ordinance 1727-2023 to account for future construction projects being assigned to DLZ Ohio, Inc. as additional tasks requiring contract modifications to authorize DLZ Ohio, Inc. to perform those tasks and to add funding to pay for the additional work to be performed.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) time frame.   \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between DLZ Ohio, Inc. and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe installation and conversion to LED lighting within the project area will provide both an additional sense of safety and security to the residents.  This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe DLZ Ohio, Inc. contract compliance number is CC-004939 and expires 10/24/2024.  \n \nThe certification of DLZ Ohio, Inc. was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  DLZ Ohio, Inc. is ODI certified as an MBE.  DLZ Ohio, Inc. does not plan to use subconsultants on this task.  The MBE/WBE spend for this project is anticipated to be 100%.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this expenditure are budgeted, available, and appropriated under project #670895-100000 Noe-Bixby Road Street Lighting Improvements within the Electricity Bond Fund, Fund 6303.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract related to the Noe-Bixby Road Street Lighting Improvements project; and to authorize the expenditure of $129,591.25 from the Electricity Bond Fund for the contract modification.  ($129,591.25) \n \nBody \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities advertised a Request for Proposals for Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services; and\n \nWHEREAS, DLZ Ohio, Inc.
