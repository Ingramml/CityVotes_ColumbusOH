    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities (DPU) to modify a contract with K & M Kleening Service, Inc. to provide janitorial services for Division of Water (DOW) and Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD) facilities. DOW facilities include watershed buildings at Griggs and Hoover reservoirs, Hap Cremean Water Plant, Parsons Avenue Water Plant, DPU and Division of Power (DOP) offices, DOW offices, and DOW meter offices. DOSD facilities include the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant, Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant, Compost Facility and the Sewer Maintenance Operations Center. Other sites may be added in the future.  \n \nThe work to be performed under the contract includes cleaning services for office areas and industrial-type areas such as storerooms, stock rooms, construction trailers, areas adjacent to garages, kitchens, and break rooms. DOW shall furnish any and all cleaners, disinfectants, waxes, wax stripping materials, wastebasket liners, toilet seat liners, sanitation products and any other products required to provide the cleaning services.  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids for janitorial services in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code (RFSQ 022039).
