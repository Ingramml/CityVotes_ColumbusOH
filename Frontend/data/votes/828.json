(2) to add McKesson Corporation as an additional business entity associated with the employment and investment commitments related to the AGREEMENT; (3) to add 2836 West Broad Street as the “Tertiary Site” at which eligible New Employees, as defined in the AGREEMENT can first be employed; (4) to amend Attachment 1 to the AGREEMENT (also referred to in the AGREEMENT as Exhibit B) from the list of eighty-six (86) parcels to only two (2) parcels, the retained parcel and the wedge parcel, and indicate that a third future parcel was to be created from the retained parcel; (5) that the assignment provision as contained in Section 6 of the AGREEMENT be changed to indicate that City Council would extend authority to the Director of Development to transfer or assign the Agreement to (i) the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority, and (ii) any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with McKesson Corporation and that all other assignments or transfers of the Agreement would be authorized at the discretion of Columbus City Council; and (6) to add language requiring an Amendment Fee for future Grantee-initiated Amendments by Ordinance No. 1258-2019, passed May 20, 2019 and made and entered into effective July 10, 2019.\nThis AGREEMENT was subsequently authorized by COUNCIL to be Amended for the second time in relation to Phase 2 to add CHI Franklinton Phase II, LP to the AGREEMENT and assign all of the benefits and obligations as related to Phase 2 of the PROJECT to CHI Franklinton Phase II, LP and that CHI Franklinton Phase II, LP, will join CoverMyMeds LLC, McKesson Corporation and CHI Franklinton, LP as an additional entity on the AGREEMENT by Ordinance No. 0871-2020, passed April 20, 2020 and made and entered into effective July 30, 2020.\n \nThrough more recent conversations and written correspondence with OWNER, the City was made aware of a need to amend the AGREEMENT for a third time to add an entity in relation to Phase I whereby through assignment, MK 1 Property Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company will assume the obligations and commitments of the AGREEMENT from CHI Franklinton, LP as Owner related to Phase 1 of the PROJECT.  \n \nParagraph thirteen within Section 6 (Program Compliance) of the AGREEMENT states that the “AGREEMENT is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the CITY and subsequent authorization by Columbus City Council” and that “such approval and authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.”\n \nAs such, this legislation is being presented as an emergency measure in order for this Third Amendment for Assignment & Assumption to be legislated in as expedient manner as possible so that this amendment to the AGREEMENT might be fully executed so that the OWNER is able to move forward with the real property improvements as described in the AGREEMENT.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement with CoverMyMeds LLC, CHI Franklinton, LP, McKesson Corporation and CHI Franklinton Phase II, LP  for assignment and assumption in order to remove CHI Franklinton, LP as OWNER related to the AGREEMENT and to add MK 1 Property Company, LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company as OWNER related to Phase I;
