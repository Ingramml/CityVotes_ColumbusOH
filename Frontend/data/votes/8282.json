    "title": "To adopt a new Combined Development Related Fee Schedule for the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Public Service, and Public Safety, to be effective on Tuesday, January 16, 2024 and enforced on and after that date.",
    "description": "Explanation\nThe Development Services Special Revenue Fund was created to support the activities of the Department of Building and Zoning Services and other agencies charged with the review of private development, construction review, and inspection processes. This fund is supported solely by fees collected from the users of these services associated directly with the private development, construction review, and inspection processes.\nThe current fee structure has been fully reviewed and compared to the actual cost incurred by the Department of Building and Zoning Services and other reviewing agencies and partners. As a result of this review, most fees have been increased, primarily targeting larger projects, whereas fees for smaller projects will only experience slight increases. Additionally, certain fees have been streamlined and consolidated to make it easier for developers, contractors and homeowners to better anticipate development and construction related costs.\nThese proposed fee schedule changes have been reviewed by the Building Services Review Council (BSRC).\nFISCAL IMPACT: Fees have been revised to better reflect the City's actual costs associated with the private development processes.\nTitle\nTo adopt a new Combined Development Related Fee Schedule for the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Public Service, and Public Safety, to be effective on Tuesday, January 16, 2024 and enforced on and after that date.\nBody \nWHEREAS, the Development Services Special Revenue Fund was created to support the activities of the Department of Building and Zoning Services and other agencies charged with the review of private development and construction review process; and\nWHEREAS, the cost of all private development and construction review and inspection services were to be made self-sustaining through the creation of a special revenue fund called the Development Services Special Revenue Fund; and\nWHEREAS, this fund is supported solely by fees collected from the users of these services associated directly with the private development and construction review and inspection process; and\nWHEREAS, the current fee structure has been fully reviewed and compared to the actual cost incurred by the Department of Building and Zoning Services and other reviewing agencies and partners; and\nWHEREAS, as a result of this review, some fees have decreased, some have increased, while others have been simplified and condensed to make it easier for developers, contractors, and homeowners to better anticipate development and construction related costs; and\nWHEREAS, these proposed fee schedule changes have been reviewed by the Building Services Review Council (BSRC); and\nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to adopt a new Combined Development Related Fee Schedule for the Departments of Building and Zoning Services, Public Service, and Public Safety, to be effective on Tuesday, January 16, 2024; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
