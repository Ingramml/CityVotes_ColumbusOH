    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with The Water Works LLC to increase the contract amount by $40,000.00 to provide residential emergency repair services as part of the Division of Housing’s Emergency Repair Program.  This increase is the result of unanticipated increases in service demand compared to the previous year.  Contract terms and pricing will not change.\n \n \nOriginal contract amount                     $  40,000.00                     Ord. 0333-2022                                          PO316907\nModification No. 1 amount                     $150,000.00                     Ord. 1159-2022                      PO326559\nRenewal/Mod No. 2 amount                     $  12,500.00                     Ord. 2877-2022                                          PO361010\nModification No. 3 amount                     $100,000.00      Ord. 0327-2023              PO369599\nModification No. 4 amount                     $100,000.00      Ord. 1517-2023                                          PO394792  \nModification No. 5 amount                     $  15,000.00                     Ord. 1693-2023                         PO401574\nModification No. 6 amount                     $  40,000.00                                         \n Total contract amount                                          $457,500.00 \n \nThe department advertised RFQ020531 on Vendor Services seeking contractors to provide emergency mechanical repairs on November 22, 2021 with bids being due on December 16, 2021.  The Emergency Repair Program is a home repair program operated by the Housing Division.  The program was established to assist low and moderate income homeowners with plumbing, sewer repair/replacement, water line repair/replacement, hot water tanks, furnaces, and electrical issues that would impact a household remaining safely in their home.  Most homeowners are at or below 50% AMI as defined by HUD with exceptions allowed up to 80% AMI.\n \nA comprehensive RFQ was done in 2021 for these services, and contractors were identified at that time.   A new RFQ is currently underway.  Prices were initially established with the original contract awarded from RFQ020531.\n \nIn May 2022, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1159-2022 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn November 2022, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 2877-2022 to renew the contract for one \nadditional year and to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn February 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 0327-2023 to modify the contract for one \nadditional year and to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn June 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1517-2023 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nIn July 2023, Columbus City Council approved ordinance 1693-2023 to modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract term did not change.\n \nThis legislation will modify the contract to add additional funds.  The contract terms will not change.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow program services to continue without interruption.  Existing program funds are diminishing and the program is near ceasing services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the Development Taxable Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority within the proper project.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004777 and expires 3/9/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a contract with The Water Works LLC; to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the Development Taxable Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
