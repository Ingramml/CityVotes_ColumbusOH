    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Land Redevelopment Division seeks to establish not-for-profit service contracts to evaluate property held in the Land Reutilization Program for future redevelopment.  The service contracts will help determine the viability of land bank property for various projects and allow this determination to occur as early in the development process as possible.  Predevelopment activities will include architectural and engineering services, environmental assessments, legal and title work, surveys, site infrastructure review, appraisals, and similar services.  These determinations will allow both the City and non-profit entity to better assess projects prior to sale and future funding agreements.  Initial contracts will be established with the Neighborhood Design Center, Rickenbacker Woods Foundation, and the Central Ohio Community Land Trust Corporation (COCLTC).  Additional contracts will be awarded under Columbus City Codes Section 329.29 with other not-for-profit partners on an as-needed basis.   \n \nPer Section 329.30(b)(2) of the Columbus City Codes, the not-for-profit service contract with COCLTC is being awarded because the City does not currently have the staff or expertise to perform the due diligence work contemplated by the contract. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $400,000.00 in the Neighborhood Economic Development fund (2237).\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Emergency Legislation is requested to expedite certain contracts before the end of 2023 to complete due diligence activities and allow project to start early in 2024.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into not-for-profit service contracts with various non-profit entities to perform due diligence and predevelopment services on parcels held in the Land Reutilization program; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with the Central Ohio Community Land Trust Corporation; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $400,000.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development Fund; and to declare an emergency.
