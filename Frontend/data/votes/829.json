    "description": "Explanation\nNeed:  This ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to enter into a contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice (ForPsych) for psychological screening of public safety recruits for upcoming classes at the Police Academy and the Fire Academy.\n \nBid Information:  The City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFP) for these services and accepted proposals through October 1, 2020.  Four proposals were received by the deadline. An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFP which included quality and feasibility of proposals, cost, competence, ability, past performance and timeliness of reporting results.  Based upon the RFP results, a contract for these services was established with Association for Psychotherapy, Inc. (API).  However, that contract has been terminated due to questions raised by the Ohio Board of Psychology regarding API’s provision of such services. \n \nThe Commission is now requesting authorization to enter into a contract with ForPsych, one of the four original respondents to the RFP for provision of the needed assessment services.  ForPsych was not previously selected because there were concerns that the City would need to invest in several dozen computer tablets to conduct testing.  However, it has been confirmed that candidate assessments could be administered via paper/pencil documents or use of a City computer lab, negating the need for any technology investment by the City.  \n \nForPsych consists of highly qualified psychologists who can provide the assessment services and offers flexible scheduling.  ForPsych’s original bid was $400 per assessment but the City is requiring an in-depth review of documentation and analysis, apparently more than originally proposed by the vendor.  As such, the City and ForPsych have agreed to a per assessment cost of $550.00 which was the API rate for said services and remains significantly lower than the remaining two RFP respondents. \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested in order to establish the contract immediately so that needed assessment services can be completed for police and fire academy classes scheduled for June and December 2021.\n \nContract Compliance Number:  CC033463, expires October 1, 2022.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this service was budgeted in the Civil Service Commission’s general fund budget.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to enter into a contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the psychological screening of public safety recruits; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($100,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2020, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for psychological screening services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the new contract to the Association for Psychotherapy, Inc.; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the contract with Association for Psychotherapy, Inc. has been terminated and a new vendor is needed to provide psychological assessment services; and,\n \nWHEREAS, ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice was a respondent to the most recent RFP for said assessment services and is willing to provide said services; and,\n \nWHEREAS an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice because it is necessary to complete said assessment services of public safety candidates for academy classes in June and December, thereby preserving the public peace, property, health, safety, and welfare; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with ForPsych: A Forensic Psychology Practice for the purpose of administering psychological screenings to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $100,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in object class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.   \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
