    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance modifies the service agreement with Columbus Next Generation Corporation originally authorized by ordinance 1268-2021 and modified by ordinances 3315-2021, 2279-2022, and 2156-2023 for administration of the program providing exterior home repair to address code violations.\n \nColumbus Next Generation (“NextGen”) has been working with The City of Columbus, Office of the City Attorney, and the Franklin County Environmental Courts to assist homeowners throughout the city that are elderly and/or disabled to repair code violations on their homes that are in the court systems (and have been) since prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Repairs range from roof repair to new roofs, gutters, painting, sewer line work, porch/foundation work, cutting down dead trees, overgrown high weeds, branches and grass.  The homeowners do not have the financial means or physical ability to do such repairs.  Their incomes are very limited. In July 2021, City Attorney Zack Klein’s office requested and received grant money in the amount of $100,000 to start the Home Repair Program.  NextGen works with local contractors and encourages minority participation as much as possible.  All contractors are licensed, bonded, have BWC insurance and are registered with the City of Columbus as a contractor (in order to pull necessary permits, if needed, for repairs).  Once repairs are complete, NextGen contacts the City Code Officer that referred properties to the court system to make sure the repairs meet the requirements to close out the current code violations.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes an increase of the available funding by $220,000.00 from the General Fund, the current contract term date of December 31, 2024, is to remain unchanged.\n \nColumbus Next Generation Corporation, FID: 46-2621229 CC#: CC008637, expires 5/30/2025\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the General Fund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to modify an existing contract with Columbus Next Generation Corporation; and to authorize an expenditure of $220,000.00 within the General Fund.
