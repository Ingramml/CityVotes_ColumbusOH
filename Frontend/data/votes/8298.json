    "description": "Explanation\nIn March 2023, City Council announced our Housing Initiatives, a 12-piece policy legislative package that seeks to invest in our city through the sustainable development of new affordable housing units, preserve our current housing stock, and ensure the housing market is inclusive of all people, regardless of socio-economic status. These initiatives represent a team effort at City Council to address the problems within our community. In order to truly effectuate change, proper enforcement measures must be in place to ensure that residents who experience discrimination or mistreatment have an avenue for recourse. \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Legal Aid Society of Columbus for referral services for fair housing enforcement. The services that Legal Aid will provide cannot be performed by current city staff as there are currently no employment classifications that conform to the duties associated with this work.\nFiscal Impact: Funding is available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.  \nEmergency Designation: An emergency exists that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Building and Zoning Services to enter into this contract in order to provide a mechanism for fair housing enforcement, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Legal Aid Society of Columbus for referral services for fair housing enforcement; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $10,000.00 in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
