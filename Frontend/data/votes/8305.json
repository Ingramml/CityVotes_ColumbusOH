    "description": "Explanation                     \n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify three existing contracts for language services at Columbus Public Health in an amount not to exceed $135,000.00. \n \nThe contract with Access 2 Interpreters LLC, entered into on April 1, 2023 for the period ending March 31, 2024 will be modified by increasing the contract in an amount not to exceed $91,000.00 for a new contract amount of $249,400.00. This contract was previously increased with Ordinance 2836-2023.\n \nThe contract with Effectiff LLC, entered into on April 1, 2023 for the period ending March 31, 2024 will be modified by increasing the contract in an amount not to exceed $28,000.00 for a new contract amount of $95,000.00.\n \nThe contract with Sign Language USA LLC, entered into on May 1, 2023 for the period ending March 31, 2024 will be modified by increasing the contract in an amount not to exceed $16,000.00 for a new contract amount of $86,000.00.\n \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires recipients of Federal financial assistance to take reasonable steps to make their programs, services, and activities accessible by eligible persons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP). As our LEP clients increase we must increase our resources to properly serve them. \n \nCost for interpretation and translations have increased as a direct result of requests. This is supported by immigration trends and the increase in the number of language service appointments. Unforeseen events such as the human trafficking crisis at Colonial Village and increased use of clinical services offered by CPH, especially by pediatric clients, have unexpectedly increased usage of interpretation services as well.\n \nStaff are also better informed about the various ways they can provide equitable services to LEP clients and use the services more frequently. Education and training provided by Language Services uncovers new initiatives such as video dubbing, automated phone message translation, adding video interpretation to staff’s mobile devices and the translation of important health forms. These needs have significantly increased our usage which has resulted in a shortage of funds.\n \nIt would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes as specified in Columbus City Code 329 because these are ongoing services, a break of which would be detrimental to the wellbeing of our clients, and the underlying contracts were previously awarded via RFP. \n \nThe price for the additional services for this contract was determined based on the number of clients already served and the programs best estimation of clients that will need to be served through the end of the contract term.\n \nThe contract compliance number for Access 2 Interpreters, LLC, is CC010229 and the underlying contract was authorized by Ordinances 0897-2022 and 0731-2023.\n \nThe contract compliance number for Effectiff, LLC, is CC041262 and the underlying contract was authorized by Ordinances 0896-2022 and 0746-2023.\n \nThe contract compliance number for Sign Language USA, LLC, is CC024678 and the underlying contract was authorized by Ordinance 1081-2023.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to ensure that there is not a gap in these essential services. Recent, unforeseen events have led to an increased need for language services at CPH and additional funds are required to pay for those services. Loss of funding could result in termination of these services for our clientele. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT Expenditures to provide these services are budgeted in the 2023 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250. ($135,000.00) \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify three existing contracts for language services with Access 2 Interpreters, LLC; Effectiff LLC; and Sign Language USA LLC; to authorize the expenditures to cover these modifications from the 2023 Health Special Revenue Fund; and to declare an emergency.
