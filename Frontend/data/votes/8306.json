    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend two (2) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to obtain Health Clinical Supplies with Henry Schein Inc. CC#000504, expires 3/8/2024 and Bound Tree Medical LLC CC#005886, expires 6/12/2025.  These contracts provide for medical equipment and accessories, patient care, and treatment products used by the Columbus Public Health Department in various clinics.  This modification is necessary to ensure supplies are available for the care of patients.  \n \nThese contracts, PO219622 (Henry Schein, Inc.) and PO214487 Bound Tree Medical, LLC) were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ013896 and authorized under Ordinance Number 3282-2019 and will expire December 31, 2023.  In accordance with the bid specifications, the City and Henry Schein Inc. and Bound Tree Medical LLC can extend the contract for two (2) additional one (1) year terms subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City Authorities. The parties renewed the contracts per the authority under Ordinance 3282-2019, for an additional one-year term.  Because Ordinance 3282-2019 authorized only a one-year term renewal, it is necessary to modify the contract per Columbus City Codes Section 329.09(b) to extend the contracts. The new contract expiration dates will be December 31, 2024.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation  be considered an emergency measure to insure there is no interruption of goods/services provided.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify and extend the option contracts.  The Columbus Public Health Department must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Health Clinical Supplies with Henry Schein, Inc. and Bound Tree Medical, LLC; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into two (2) Universal Term Contracts for Health Clinical Supplies for use by the Columbus Public Health Department; and,  \n \nWHEREAS, these contracts were entered into in accordance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code, pursuant to solicitation RFQ013896 with Henry Schein, Inc. and Bound Tree Medical, LLC deemed as the lowest, most responsive, responsible, and best bidders; and\n \nWHEREAS, in accordance with the bid specifications, the City and Henry Schein, Inc. and Bound Tree Medical, LLC can extend the contracts for an additional one year period, subject to mutual agreement and approval of proper City authorities; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Columbus Public Health Department, as the current contracts expires on December 31, 2023, in that it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to immediately modify and extend two (2) Universal Term Contracts with Henry Schein Inc. and Bound Tree Medical LLC for the option to obtain Health Clinical Supplies needed to provide services to patients at various health clinics, thereby preserving the public health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts with Henry Schein, Inc. and Bound Tree Medical, LLC, for a period of one (1) year, from December 31, 2023 to and including December 31, 2024.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
