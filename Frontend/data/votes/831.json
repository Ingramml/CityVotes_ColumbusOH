    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate a total of $5,000.02 in grant money to fund the Enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (eGISP) Grant Program, for the period of July 1, 2021 through July 31, 2021.   \nThrough increased laboratory and surveillance capacity, participation in the eGISP program will permit Columbus Public Health (CPH) to increase our detection of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (in other words, antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea infection) in our jurisdiction. This program is part of the US government’s “National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria” and supports the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiative.”  Examination of samples from gonorrhea-infected clients seeking screening for sexually transmitted diseases in the CPH Sexual Health clinic will be sent to CDC for antibiotic susceptibility testing.  Results are combined with findings from other geographical sites across the US to create a current profile of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea.  Results are also shared with surveillance and clinical experts at CPH who can make locally-relevant decisions about patient treatment. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the city's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The eGISP Grant Program is entirely funded by the Ohio Department of Health.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Department of Health to fund the Enhanced Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (eGISP) Grant Program; to authorize the appropriation of $5,000.02 from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($5,000.02)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $5,000.02 in grant funds have been made available through the Ohio Department of Health for the eGISP Grant Program, for the period of July 1, 2021 through July 31, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds from the Ohio Department of Health for the support of the eGISP Grant Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the city's accounting system as soon as possible.  Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Health Department in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health and to appropriate these funds to the Health Department to ensure the immediate delivery of services, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;  Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $5,000.02 from the Ohio Department of Health for the eGISP Grant Program, for the period of July 1, 2021 through July 31, 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources during the month ending July 31, 2021, the sum of $5,000.02 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated upon receipt of an executed grant agreement to the Health Department, Division No. 50, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except upon voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.  That at the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused city match monies may be transferred back to the city fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.  That all related fee revenue income is hereby deemed appropriated. \n \nSECTION 7.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
