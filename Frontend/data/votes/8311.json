    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to add funds for fuel surcharges associated with the 2023 contract renewal with Rumpke of Ohio, Inc., in the amount of $165,000.00, and to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute contract modifications if needed to clarify terms and conditions of the contract or to implement program improvements and enhancements.\n \nContinuation of a separate collection for yard waste and recyclable items is necessary to segregate them from the regular waste stream.  This serves to extend the life of the landfill operated by the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO).  \n \nThe Collection Services of Yard Waste and Recyclables contract provides bi-weekly collection of yard waste and weekly collection of recyclables for residences, servicing of recycling containers deployed along Broad Street and High Street as part of the Pedestrian Recycling Program, glass pick-up from restaurants and bars along N. High Street as part of the Recycle On High program, and recyclable collection services for the solar compactors deployed in the Short North Area. \n \nThe Department of Public Service issued a bid in 2016 to establish a contract to replace the expiring Collection Services of Yard Waste and Recyclables contract.  City Council approved awarding this contract to Rumpke via Ordinance 0479-2017, passed by Council on 3/13/17.  The contract is a five-year contract expiring 3/31/22, with five one-year renewal options.  This modification will add funds to pay for fuel surcharges negotiated as part of the most recent contract renewal.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $165,000.00\n \nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                               $8,500,000.00 (Ordinance 0479-2017, PO052658)\nContract Year 2 (two) Amount:                                                         $8,730,000.00 (Ordinance 0607-2018, PO113383)\nContract Year 3 (three) Amount:                                                       $9,017,736.00 (Ordinance 0927-2019, PO168307)\nContract Year 4 (four) Amount:                                                                            $9,226,776.00 (Ordinance 0441-2020, PO219470)\nContract Year 5 (five) Amount:                                                                          $9,540,336.00 (Ordinance 0583-2021, PO265724)\nContract Year 6 (six) Amount:                                                                   $10,379,496.00 (Ordinance 0813-2022, PO319900)\nContract Year 7 (this year) Amount:                                                 $16,314,036.00 (Ordinance 0775-2023, PO379141)\nContract Year 7 (fuel surcharges) Amount:                      $165,000.00 (this ordinance)\nTotal Contract Amount:                                                   $71,873,380.00\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Rumpke.\n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe amount of the fuel surcharges was negotiated after the contract renewal was signed. Therefore additional funds are required to pay aged accounts receivable portions of previous invoices, and to add funds for the remainder of the existing contract year.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe vendor has an existing multi-year contract executed on March 3, 2017. Therefore a bid is not needed at this time.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification and extension is consistent with rates that were established by historical data from invoices the City has paid thus far for services rendered.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nRumpke’s contract compliance number is CC005677 and expires 3/18/2024.  .\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe Division of Refuse Collection's 2023 General Fund budget includes $165,000.00 available for this purpose.\n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow timely execution of this contract, to prevent a lapse of a recycling and yard waste collection contract in order to continue this service to residents.  \n \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify the contract with Rumpke of Ohio, Inc., for yard waste and recycling collection services; to authorize the expenditure of $165,000.00 from the General Fund for added fuel surcharges negotiated as part of the most recent contract renewal; and to declare an emergency.  ($165,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus provides yard waste and recyclable collection through a contract established through the bid process; and \n \nWHEREAS, a five-year contract with five one-year renewal options to perform these services was awarded to Rumpke of Ohio, Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, year seven of the contract was authorized earlier this year with Ord. 0775-2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to add funds to the contract to pay for fuel surcharges; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $165,000.00 from the Division of Refuse Collection from the General Fund; and \n \nWHEREAS, it may be necessary to execute contract modifications to clarify terms and conditions of the contract, and to execute contract modifications to implement program improvements and enhancements; and\n  \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Public Service Department, Refuse Collection Division, in that it is immediately necessary to add funds to the contract with Rumpke of Ohio, Inc. to pay for fuel surcharges, to prevent a lapse in the contract and to allow the continuation of the service, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare, now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
