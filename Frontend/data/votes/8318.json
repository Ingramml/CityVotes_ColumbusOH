The Real Estate was recorded in the public land records in the applicable county in the state of Ohio. Additionally, it may be necessary for the City to enter into agreements, as approved by the City Attorney, with the grantors of the Real Estate in order to address any real estate tax or assessment implications associated with the City’s acquisition and acceptance of the Real Estate.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:\n \nNot applicable.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nNot applicable.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:\n \nNot applicable.\n \nTitle\nTo formally accept certain real estate conveyed to the City that is being used for various public purposes; and to authorize the directors of the Departments of Public Utilities, Public Service, Finance and Management, Development, and Recreation and Parks to enter into any necessary agreements, as approved by the City Attorney's Office, in order to address any real estate tax or assessment issues.
