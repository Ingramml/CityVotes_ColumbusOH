    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify Agreement PO210530 with YWCA Columbus by extending the Agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021. This extension will allow YWCA Columbus to fully complete emergency shelter repairs of real property located at 900 Harvey Court Columbus, OH 43219. \n \nThe COVID19 pandemic created a great challenge during 2020 and while the YWCA was able to complete a surprising number of projects, it was unable to complete all of the outlined capital improvement projects in this agreement.

This legislation would modify the Agreement authorized by Ordinance No.2819-2019.\n \nEmergency action is requested so repair activities can continue and be completed without further delay.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funds are needed for this modification.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the emergency shelter repair agreement with YWCA Columbus by extending the Agreement (PO210530) termination date to June 30, 2021; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Development desires to modify Agreement PO210530 with YWCA Columbus by extending the Agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021; and\n \nWHEREAS, this modification supports the purpose of YWCA Columbus fully completing emergency shelter repairs of real property located at 900 Harvey Court Columbus, OH 43219; and\n \nWHEREAS, no additional funds are needed to modify this agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to modify the agreement with YWCA Columbus so repair activities can continue and be completed without further delay, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                     That the Director of the Department of Development is authorized to modify Agreement PO210530 with YWCA Columbus by extending the Agreement termination date from December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021.\n \nSECTION 2.                     That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of City Code Chapter 329 relating to modifications.  \n \nSECTION 3.                     That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
