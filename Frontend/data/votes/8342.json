    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Columbus Department of Development is proposing to enter into a dual-rate Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in an amount equal to (i) twenty-five percent (25%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees and (ii) thirty percent (30%) of the City of Columbus income tax withheld on the Columbus payroll of new employees, who are also City of Columbus residents at the end of each calendar year, both for a term up to five (5) consecutive years.\n \nHenry Wells and William G. Fargo and other investors founded Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) on March 18, 1852.  Headquartered in San Francisco, California, the company built an innovative start-up to help customers build businesses and manage money in a rapidly changing world, and to handle the banking and express business prompted by the California Gold Rush. The two partners used their hands-on experience making deliveries of money and valuables by steamboat and stagecoach to develop a network of offices from California to New York and around the world.  Across time, and in every generation, Wells Fargo has continued helping customers go further by providing innovative financial services to help them get ahead.  Through expansion and acquisitions, Wells Fargo has since grown into one of the nation’s leading financial services companies providing banking, insurance, trust and investments, mortgage banking, investment banking, retail banking, brokerage services and consumer and commercial finance. \n \nWells Fargo is proposing to invest a total project cost of approximately $3,250,000.00, which includes $1,250,000.00 in machinery and equipment, and $2,000,000.00 in furniture and fixtures to establish a new Technology Center.  With this investment, the company proposes to enter into a lease agreement on a vacant commercial office facility consisting of approximately 67,816 square feet at 3075 Loyalty Circle, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel numbers 010-294812 and 010-295705 (the “Project Site”). The proposed project will allow Wells Fargo to expand into the Columbus region by creating 350 net new full-time permanent positions with a cumulative associated estimated annual payroll of approximately $43,750,000.00 at the proposed Project Site. \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation\n \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a dual-rate Jobs Growth Incentive Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. for a term of up to five (5) consecutive years in consideration of the company’s proposed total capital investment of $3,250,000.00 and the creation of 350 net new full-time permanent positions with an estimated annual payroll of approximately $43,750,000.00.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City desires to increase employment opportunities and encourage the creation of new jobs in the City in order to improve the overall economic climate of the City and its citizens; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development received a completed Jobs Growth Incentive Application from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.; and \n \nWHEREAS, Henry Wells and William G.
