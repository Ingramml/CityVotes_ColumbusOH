    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The Director of the Department of Development is requesting authorization to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement on behalf of the City with G & J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, Inc. (“G&J Pepsi”, and also referred to as the \"Enterprise\"). The Ohio Enterprise Zone law Section 5709.62(C) of the Ohio Revised Code authorizes the City to enter into a Council-approved tax abatement agreements between the City and qualifying companies.\n \nIn 1925, the owner of the Grand Pop Bottling Company in Cincinnati decided to put the company on the market. Nell and Walter Gross and Esther and Isaac Jarson decided to purchase the company and become equal partners. In 1935, a representative of the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company called upon the Grosses and Jarsons after having been turned down by several other beverage companies and offered them a Pepsi franchise. Walter and Isaac agreed to try it and put several barrels of concentrates under some steps in the old plant. They did not produce the Pepsi product for several months, but when they did, it began to sell fairly well. Today, G&J Pepsi is a privately owned company comprised of seven franchises, which distribute Pepsi-Cola brand products in Athens, Columbus, Hamilton, Portsmouth, Ripley and Zanesville, Ohio and Lexington, Kentucky. G&J Pepsi is the largest family owned and operated Pepsi franchise bottler. Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, the company operates distribution centers in Chillicothe, and Hillsboro, Ohio as well as Winchester and Harrod​sburg, Kentucky. In 2015, G&J Pepsi established a new production line in Columbus to manufacture its own plastic bottles for use in its soft drink bottling operation. The company distributes Pepsi brand products as well as packages under Lipton, Ocean Spray, Starbucks, and SoBe labels as well as Cadbury (Dr. Pepper) beverages. The entire G&J Franchise employs over 1,600 employees and has over 300 beverage routes.\n \nG&J Pepsi is proposing to invest a total project cost of approximately $25,525,000.00, which includes $18,125,000.00 in new construction cost, $1,500,000.00 in improvements to its existing facilities, $4,450,000.00 in machinery and equipment, and $1,450,000.00 in furniture and fixtures to expand its bottling operation. The proposed expansion will occur in three different phases. The first phase, the Blow Mold Self Injection phase, will allow the company to create their own bottle preforms, which are used to blowmold bottles. This will require a building modification of approximately 4,800 sq.-ft. of the company’s current facility. The second phase, Office Expansion, consists of the expansion of approximately 25,000 sq.-ft. of the company’s existing offices. In the third phase, G&J Pepsi proposes to construct a new 77,400 sq.-ft. Warehouse and distribution facility. These proposed expansions and improvements will support company growth at G&J Pepsi and will help expedite the bottling preform process and maintain operations under G&J Pepsi. Additionally, G&J Pepsi will retain 546 full-time jobs with an annual payroll of approximately $27,588,250.00 and create forty-four (44) net new full-time permanent positions with an estimated annual payroll of $2,232,000.00. All real property improvements, job retention and creation will occur at 1241 Gibbard Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel number 010-057636 (the “Project Site”).\n \nThe Director of the Department of Development is recommending that Council approve a 75%/10-year Enterprise Zone tax abatement on real property improvements made by the Enterprise at the Project Site, in consideration of creating the New Employees.\n \nThe Columbus City School District has been advised of this project. \n \nThis legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with G & J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers, Inc.
