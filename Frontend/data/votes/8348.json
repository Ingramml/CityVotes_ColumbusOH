    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Finance and Management Department, on behalf of the Department of Technology (DoT), to establish a purchase order with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, utilizing the State Master Cloud Service Agreement -- MCSA0016, for the procurement of various Adobe software application products through a Large Government Agency Agreement (LGA). \nAdobe has historically focused on the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards digital marketing software. Adobe is best known for its Photoshop image editing software, Acrobat Reader and Acrobat, the Portable Document Format (PDF), and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud. City departments use Adobe software to improve efficiency and enhance communications while meeting requirements such as HIPPA compliance. \nPricing for the above-described services was obtained via the State Master Cloud Service Agreement - MCSA0016. The two vendors approved to provide pricing through this vehicle are Software House International (SHI) and Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC. Brown’s pricing overall was lower than that submitted by SHI. As such, DoT recommends awarding the bid to Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, for $229,438.22. Of this total, $188,349.38 is for the continuation of 1,061 licenses. The balance of $41,088.84 is contingency funds in the event additional licenses are needed. \nThe term of the contract will be for one year, from March 30, 2024, to March 29, 2025. This ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of up to $229,438.22 for the above-described purpose. Finally, because only two (2) bids were received, the department requests a waiver of the relevant sections of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Codes pertaining to competitive bidding.\nThe City of Columbus has been utilizing the State of Ohio Adobe product STS for several years now. The reason for using this contract has been due to Adobe having shared that we will get better pricing from this contract than having our own UTC. The Department of Technology is requesting the continued use of this contract to keep our existing subscription portal in place and continue to add any new subscriptions to this portal. DoT has reached out to all three resellers listed on the STS. Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC provided the lowest and best bid. \nFISCAL IMPACT: \nThe cost associated with this legislation for Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, to purchase Adobe software application products is $229,438.22.  Funding for this purchase is budgeted and available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, and Information Service Operating Fund. \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:   \nVendor Name: Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC; EBO_CC#010668 Expiration: March 3, 2024, EBO_MBE#010668 Expiration: December 31, 2023.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Finance and Management Department, on behalf of the Department of Technology, to establish a purchase order with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, utilizing State Master Cloud Service Agreement - MCSA0016 for the procurement of various Adobe software application products through a Large Government Agency agreement (LGA) for the Department of Technology and various other city agencies; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City code; and to authorize the expenditure of $229,438.22 for the above-described purpose.
