    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into contract with AVI Systems Inc. for City Hall conference room renovations.\n \nColumbus City Hall Room 225 is currently outfitted with technology equipment that is beyond its useful life, including media devices that have already failed or are beyond maintenance and repair. As part of this renovation project, AVI Systems Inc. will remove all current technology components and replace all existing cameras, display monitors, install microphones and corresponding rack components, and implement a new presentation system. Upon completion of these upgrades, it is expected that this conference room will be utilized for press conferences and other media events, commission and committee meetings, and for additional meeting space for city staff.\n \nA bid waiver is requested for this contract. Given the need to quickly execute these renovations, a formal RFP process was not utilized. City staff informally solicited bids from multiple vendors and ultimately received two bids. Upon review, it is recommended that AVI Systems Inc. be selected as the vendor of choice.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order for the work to be completed rapidly in anticipation of significantly greater demand in 2024.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements budget and a transfer of funding between projects will be necessary.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into contract with AVI Systems Inc. for City Hall conference room renovations; to amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation, transfer, and expenditure of $165,907.13 within the General Permanent Improvement Fund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
