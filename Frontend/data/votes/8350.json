MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an assigned City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as provided by the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI). None of the submitted bids achieved the MBE/WBE Program goal. Decker Construction Company and Complete General Construction Company submitted lower bids than Shelly & Sands, Inc. However, after consideration of all bids and supporting documentation, ODI determined that Shelly & Sands, Inc., with an MBE/WBE attainment rate of 14.39%, was the lowest most comparable bid that comes closest to meeting the MBE/WBE Program goal. ODI stated it is their position that award should be to the lowest most comparable bid, the third low bidder, Shelly & Sands, Inc.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the Rocky Fork TIF Fund, Rocky Fork TIF Capital Fund, Preserve TIF Fund, Dublin Granville South TIF Fund, Dublin Granville North TIF Fund, and the Northeast Corridor Pay as We Grow Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer cash between the Rocky Fork TIF Fund and the Rocky Fork TIF Capital Fund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer within the Preserve TIF Fund, Dublin Granville South TIF Fund, Dublin Granville North TIF Fund and the Northeast Corridor Pay as We Grow Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into contract with Shelly and Sands, Inc. for the Intersection Improvements - Dublin‐Granville Road at Ulry Road project; and to authorize the expenditure of $4,541,549.31 split among the Rocky Fork TIF Capital Fund, Preserve TIF Fund, Dublin Granville South TIF Fund, Dublin Granville North TIF Fund, and the Northeast Corridor Pay as We Grow Fund for the project.
