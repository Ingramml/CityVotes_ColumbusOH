    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional services agreement with Ascension Construction Solutions, LLC for the WWTFs Professional Construction Management Services #3 project, CIP #650261-103000, in an amount up to $17,952,267.00.\n \nThis planned modification provides construction administration and management services including, construction inspection, coordination, reporting, budgeting, scheduling, document tracking, and related tasks associated with a multi-project program. This modification adds scope and funding for the following construction contracts:\n \n1)                     650252-100010, JPWWTP Screening Improvements\n2)                     650353-100007, SWWTP Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization\n3)                     650354-100000, SWWTP Post Aeration Diffuser Replacement\n4)                     650505-100001, SMOC Inventory Control Consolidations\n5)                     650660-100013, DOSD Sanitary Pump Stations SA13 Evaluation & Upgrade\n6)                     Small Capital Projects Program, Project Series: 650261-100300, multiple contracts from ongoing program.\n7)                     HVAC Program, Project Series: 650265-100200 multiple contracts from ongoing program.\n8)                     Roofing Program, Project Series: 650234-100200 multiple contracts from ongoing program.\n9)                     Additional construction contracts to be added by contract modification.\n \nProjects are in Community Planning Area 99, as these benefit the entire City.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $17,952,267.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:       $3,927,328.69 (Ord.2295-2022; PO367893; PO367899; PO367907; PO367915; PO367920; PO367923; PO367927)\nModification #1                        $17,952,267.00 (Current) \nModification #2                        $17,000,000.00 (Future estimated amount)\nTotal:                                        $38,879,595.69\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was bid as a three-year contract with the intention of assigning projects to the contract that started during this three-year window.  This modification is not being processed for a change of scope but only to add funding.  It is needed because funding for the projects administered under this contract is done on a yearly basis instead of all three years at once.  This is the first of two planned contract modifications to add funding to fully fund the contract for the contract period.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Ascension Construction Solutions, LLC and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform contract tasks.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe performance of professional contract management services for the subject construction contracts will help to prevent or reduce the number of construction claims, provide quality control for construction, and minimize any unavoidable claims. No community outreach or environmental factors are considered for this project.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nAscension Construction Solutions, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC0283827 and expires 8/17/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Ascension Construction Solutions, LLC.\n \n4.
