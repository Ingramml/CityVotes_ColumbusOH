    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design in an amount up to $50,000.00 in support of architectural design services that will be used to aid in the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program in the City of Columbus.\n                      \nAs Columbus continues to grow, there are real concerns that housing affordability and supply issues will continue to worsen. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) provide an opportunity to increase the housing supply, provide financial stability for owners, and can be leveraged to increase affordable housing. ADUs have the opportunity to positively impact a number of Columbus residents, including aging residents looking to downsize but stay in their neighborhood; retirees on fixed incomes needing extra income to cover their mortgage; homeowners looking for real estate investments; young professionals without families; and people with disabilities that can have their own living space but still be close to family support. The overall economic impact of ADUs is that they will increase the supply of studio and one-bedroom options in Columbus. \nColumbus City Council approved Ordinance 0231-2023 on February 6, 2023 authorizing and agreement with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design in an amount up to $125,000.00.  The term of the agreement expired on October 31, 2023.  In order to complete the services, a new agreement is desired with a start date of November 1, 2023 in an amount not to exceed $50,000.00. \nThis legislation authorized the repeal of Ordinance 2814-2023.\nA waiver of competitive bidding is requested due to the immediate need in beginning design work on the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot in order to create housing opportunities for residents of Columbus.\nEmergency Designation: Emergency action is requested to ensure that Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design can immediately complete design services in aid of the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds are available within the Development Taxable Bonds Fund. \nContract Compliance: the vendor number is 005667 and expires 03/28/2025\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design in support of architectural design services that will be used to aid in the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program for Columbus residents; to authorize an expenditure from the Development Taxable Bond fund; to authorize expenditures prior to the Purchase Order; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; to repeal ordinance 2814-2023; and to declare an emergency ($50,000.00).\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, as the city of Columbus continues to grow, there are real concerns that housing affordability and supply issues will continue to worsen; and,\nWHEREAS, accessory dwelling units (ADUs) provide an opportunity to increase the housing supply, provide financial stability for owners, and can be leveraged to increase affordable housing; and,\n \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved Ordinance 0231-2023 on February 6, 2023 authorizing and agreement with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design in an amount up to $125,000.00; and \n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council approved Ordinance 2814-2023 authorizing a modification to the agreement to extend the expiration date; and \n \nWHEREAS, the agreement expired before a modification could be executed and it is now necessary to repeal ordinance 2814-2023; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design in an amount up to $50,000.00 in support of architectural design services that will be used to aid in the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has been determined that it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding requirement to ensure that Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design can immediately begin providing design services in aid of the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with Jonathan Barnes Architecture and Design so it can immediately complete design services that will be used to aid in the Accessory Dwelling Unit Pilot Program, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.
