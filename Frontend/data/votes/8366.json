    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $400,000.00 from the anticipated 2024 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to fund some of the Department of Development’s Housing Division’s 2024 personnel costs.\n \nThese funds are for a portion of the 2024 Housing Division budget for personnel expenses (other funding is provided by the general fund and other federal grants) and are a portion of the HOME Administration monies anticipated to be received in the 2024 grant. Additional ordinances may be forthcoming later in 2024 to appropriate the balance of the HOME Administration grant funds and/or 2023 program income available for personnel expenses for the remainder of the year, once the 2024 grant amount is known.\n \nThis legislation represents partial appropriation for the HOME portion of the 2024 Draft Action Plan, per Ordinance 2993-2023, adopted by City Council on November 20, 2023.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to ensure personnel funds are in place for FY 2024 at the start of FY 2024 to avoid any delay in the payment of relevant salaries.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds in the amount of $400,000.00 for this appropriation are supported by the anticipated 2024 HOME entitlement award from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and are allocated from the HOME Administrative monies set aside within the 2024 HOME Grant (G442302).
