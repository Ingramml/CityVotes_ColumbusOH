    "description": "`Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health has been awarded the 2024 Alcohol, Drug And Mental Health (ADAMH) Board of Franklin County grant service contract for the Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) and Neighborhood Social Services Divisions to fund the following projects: Outpatient Treatment (General Claims); Women’s Recovery/Treatment; Prevention BLOCK Grants; Grief Counseling; and Gun Violence. The funding for the projects totals $1,854,955.81 from ADAMH and begins January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024.\n \nThe Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Outpatient Treatment (General Claims) and Women’s Recovery/Treatment grant programs are primarily funded through the ADAMH Board of Franklin County and the grant programs also generate the following revenues which are to be appropriated; anticipated fiscal year 2024 client fees in the amount of $177,576.00 and Medicaid in the amount of $222,424.00 for a total appropriation of $2,254,955.81. These funds will enable Columbus Public Health to continue to provide treatment, counseling and prevention services to men, women, children/families, homeless population and to serve clients referred by the criminal justice system.\n \nThe Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) Prevention Program will serve clients, who may receive multiple services, through Columbus City Schools, After School/Summer programs, Latina Prevention programming, HIV/Early Intervention sites, Parenting classes, and Recreation Centers. Adults and family members will be served; children and adolescents will be served through youth programming; and transitional age youth will be served through youth mentoring, workforce development and programming. The ADS Comprehensive Treatment Program will provide treatment services to men and women through the provision of Biopsychosocial Assessments, Individual, Intensive Outpatient and Outpatient counseling. 70% of the population to be served are men and 30% will be women. The Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program will serve clients who will be prescribed Suboxone, Sublocade or Vivitrol. Additional clients needing MAT services may be served through our collaboration with a partner agency. This grant permits innovative ways to retain and support the engagement of group participants to include food incentives. A portion of the funds from this grant will be utilized to purchase food and beverages for client treatment and prevention groups throughout the year. The spending cap is $25 per ADS staff member per group, not to exceed 12 groups per year. Any purchase of alcohol is strictly prohibited.  \n \nThe Neighborhood Social Services (NSS) Gun Violence grant program will serve clients by creating a network of support for families after loss from paid peer supporters who have been through loss as well; the Grief Counseling grant program will serve clients by providing expedited access to grief counseling for families impacted by homicide.\n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible to avoid forfeiture of the grant funds.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Alcohol, Drug, and Mental Health Grant is fully funded by ADAMH Board of Franklin County and does not require a City match. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept the grant service contract from the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health (ADAMH) Board of Franklin County in the amount of $1,854,955.81;
