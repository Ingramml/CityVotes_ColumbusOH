    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe Department of Development, Planning Division submits this legislation for approval to incorporate  the Brewery District Commission into the Historic Resources Commission.   This legislation also seeks to increase the number of commissioners on the Historic Resources Commission from seven (7) commissioners to nine (9) commissioners, to account for the expanded jurisdiction of the Historic Resources Commission resulting from this legislation. \n \nAs part of this legislation, the Brewery District will remain a distinct historic district with the same architectural standards that currently apply to the District.  Under the legislation, the Historic Resources Commission, rather than the Brewery District Commission, will review applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.\n \nThe reduction of the number of historic architectural review commissions will create efficiencies.  The proposal to reduce the number of architectural review commissions was originally considered in the City’s 2008 Historic Preservation Working Group Final Report (2008).  At that time, it was noted that 82% of cities surveyed operate with one historic preservation commission.  Reducing the number of architectural review commissions will allow Planning Division staff to focus on broader, equitable development matters, including preservation education and engagement matters for historically African-American neighborhoods. \n \nThe Historic Resources Commission was designed to have a citywide focus, is experienced in reviewing proposals from a wide variety of districts and individually listed properties, and knowledgably applies both citywide and area-specific guidelines for review.  Precedent exists for enabling the Historic Resources Commission to assume additional preservation and architectural review authority:\n \n•                     In October 1987 the North Market District Commission (NMDC) was established, and in 1994 the NMDC was dissolved, with five of the Commission’s thirteen members continuing to serve on the Historic Resources Commission. \n \n•                     With the exception of the Brewery District, all Columbus Historic Districts that have been established since October 1987 (after North Market was established) have come under the purview of the Historic Resources Commission, including Bryden Road Historic District, 18th & East Broad Street Historic District, Indianola Forest Historic District, New Indianola Historic District, Northwood Park Historic District, South High Street Historical Group, and 21st & East Broad Street Historic District.\n \nOn November 2, 2023, the Brewery District Commission voted unanimously to support the proposal to dissolve the Brewery District Commission and transfer preservation and review authority to the Historic Resources Commission. \n \nOn November 16, 2023, the Historic Resources Commission also voted unanimously to support the proposal. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance will have no fiscal impact.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Chapter 3117 of the Columbus City Codes relative to the Historic Resources Commission; to repeal and replace Section 3119.09 of the Columbus City Codes relative to the Brewery District Commission and Historic Resources Commission assumption of jurisdiction over the Brewery District; and to amend Section 3119.21 of the Columbus City Codes relative to the Historic Resources Commission assumption of jurisdiction over the Brewery District.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Brewery District Commission was established to have authority over historical preservation and architectural review matters within the Brewery District; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Historic Resources Commission was established to have authority over historical preservation and architectural review matters over individual properties listed on the Columbus Register of Historic Properties and specific historic areas within the City of Columbus; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Brewery District Commission currently receives the lowest number of applications among all the architectural review commissions in the City; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Historic Resources Commission has the expertise to oversee historic preservation and architectural review matters for properties located within the Brewery District; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is the recommendation of the Department of Development, Planning Division to incorporate the Brewery District Commission into the Historic Resources Commission, and to expand the membership of the Historic Resources Commission from seven (7) members to nine (9) members; and \n \nWHEREAS, on November 2, 2023, the Brewery District Commission voted unanimously in an advisory capacity to support the proposal of the Planning Division; and \n \nWHEREAS, on November 16, 2023, the Historic Resources Commission voted unanimously in an advisory capacity to support the proposal of the Planning Division; and \n \nWHEREAS, the proposal of the Planning Division will lead to greater efficiencies within the Division and facilitate Planning Division staff to focus on other priorities of the Division, including equitable outreach programs to historically African-American neighborhoods, among other priorities; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to amend Chapter 3117, repeal and replace Section 3119.09, and amend Section 3119.21 of the Columbus City Codes to dissolve the Brewery District Commission and transfer authority over preservation and architectural review matters in the Brewery District to the Historic Resources Commission, and to expand the membership of the Historic Resources Commission from seven (7) members to nine (9) members; NOW, THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nSECTION 1.  That Sections 3117.005, 3117.02, 3117.03, and 3117.04 of the Columbus City Codes are hereby amended, per the attachment to this ordinance, which is incorporated herein by reference.  \n \nSECTION 2.  That existing Sections 3117.005, 3117.02, 3117.03, and 3117.04 of the Columbus City Codes are hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 3.  That Section 3119.09 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed and replaced, per the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That Section 3119.21 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby amended, per the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That existing Section 3119.21 of the Columbus City Codes is hereby repealed.\n \nSECTION 6.  That this ordinance shall take effect from and after the earliest date permitted by law. \n \nSECTION 7.  That enforcement of this ordinance shall commence from and after February 1, 2024.",
