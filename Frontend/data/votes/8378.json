    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:  The Department of Recreation and Parks is the first point of contact for event coordinators and has recently implemented an online City event permit process. The new application platform allows for greater visibility of event requests to all City departments. The Department of Recreation and Parks seeks to adopt code to increase the transparency of City requirements for applicants and to unify the requirements for special events held on City streets, public thoroughfares, and/or shared use paths.\nIn the interest of efficiency and consistency, the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Recreation and Parks seek code changes to repeal City Code Chapters 923- Block Parties, 924- Race Event Permits and 2111-Parade Permits and to adopt new Chapter 923- Special Event Permits. These code revisions will further align administration of Special Event Permits by the Recreation and Parks Department, enhance participant safety, increase public awareness, and result in better customer service experiences.\nFiscal Impact:  No fiscal impact.\nTitle\nTo repeal Chapters 923, 924, and 2111 of the Columbus City Codes, and adopt new Chapter 923 to create uniform requirements for events conducted on public property to be administered by the Recreation and Parks Department.
