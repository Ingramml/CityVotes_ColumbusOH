    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: On November 18, 2019 City Council passed Ordinance 2712-2019, authorizing the Finance and Management Director to establish a contract for the Fleet Management Division at 6211 Groves Rd for security guard services with S&S Management Group LLC (DBA:Guard One). The term of the contract authorized in the ordinance was for one (1) year with three optional renewals.  Ordinance 3236-2022 authorized a rate increase and the final of these renewals. \nDue to an increase in the scope of work to incorporate the Department of Safety property across the street at 4252 Groves Rd and continued increases in cost, this contract was under review to be reworked. During this time the contract lapsed with no new scope defined, rates collected or contract in place. Services continued outside of contract by S&S Management Group resulting in an outstanding balance of $16,279.86. These services are critical for the safety of the large number of City of Columbus assets in place at the Fleet Management Facility. A temporary informal contract was signed with S&S Management to continue these services until a full contract can be successfully bid out. Due to these costs being incurred outside of contract, pursuant to City Code the expended funds must be approved by City Council.\nBid Information:  The Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding.  RFQ013523 was advertised and Proposals were received on September 25, 2019.  Two (2) responses were received.\nTotal expenditures: the City has expended approximately $16,279.86 outside of the contracted amount.\nFiscal Impact:  Funding to restitute for these services will be authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002675.  \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This ordinance requires emergency action so that the Department of Finance and Management, Fleet Management Division can continue to have protection provided for 6211 Groves Rd without interruption. A delay in the delivery of funds will cause a cancellation of these services and leave a number of vehicles and facilities unprotected. \nTitle\n To authorize the Finance and Management Director to expend $16,279.86 with S&S Management Group LLC for the security services previously rendered outside of contract; and to declare an emergency. ($16,279.86)\nBody\nWHEREAS, there is an immediate and continued need for Security Services for the Divisions of Fleet Management, as well as other divisions; and\nWHEREAS, City Council approved the establishment security services with S&S Management Group LLC, through Ordinance 2712-2019; and \nWHEREAS, through human error, services were rendered outside of these contracted terms, and\nWHEREAS, it is therefore necessary to compensate S&S Management Group for these services rendered to allow for continued services and protection of the properties and vehicles stored at 6211 and 6252 Groves Rd, and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management, Fleet Management Division in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to pay outstanding fees for services provided to the Fleet Management Facility in order to ensure continued Security Service with S&S Management LLC for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to establish payment with S&S Management Group LLC for services provided out of contract in accordance with solicitation RFQ013523 as follows:\nS&S Management Group LLC, Outside of Contract Expenditure, $16,279.86\nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $16,279.86 is hereby authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002675 of this ordinance to pay the cost thereof.\nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\nSECTION 4. That for the reason stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be and emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
