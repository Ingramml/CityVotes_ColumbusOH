    "title": "To authorize the appropriation of funds within the County Auto License Tax Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to expend said monies or so much thereof as may be needed for Franklin County Engineer approved roadway construction and maintenance projects undertaken by the Division of Traffic Management; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Division of Traffic Management is responsible for maintaining the City's signs, signals, and pavement markings.  As a part of this activity, the City receives an annual allocation of funds from the County's $5.00 Auto License Tax for maintenance and upgrade work that has been completed by the City on arterial streets within City limits that are the responsibility of the Franklin County Engineer.  This allocation is based on motor vehicle registrations within Columbus limits.  After receipt, these funds are deposited into the City's County Auto License Tax Fund (Fund 2264) and are then subsequently transferred to the Street, Construction, Maintenance, and Repair Fund (Fund 2265) when the maintenance activity is actually completed.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the movement of funds from Fund 2264 to Fund 2265 by internal bill.  All funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated in an amount not to exceed cash received from Franklin County in 2024.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nActual and anticipated receipts into the County Auto License Tax Fund are estimated to be sufficient to support this appropriation and give the Division of Traffic Management the ability to invoice for time and material work done on arterial streets owned by Franklin County, and to meet revenue projections of the Street, Construction, Maintenance, and Repair Fund which supports the Division of Traffic Management. \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested in order to provide for this appropriation action taking effect immediately to promote efficient accounting practices and maintain prudent cash flow to division operating funds.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation of funds within the County Auto License Tax Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to expend said monies or so much thereof as may be needed for Franklin County Engineer approved roadway construction and maintenance projects undertaken by the Division of Traffic Management; and to declare an emergency.  \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Division of Traffic Management is responsible for maintaining the City's signs, signals, and pavement markings; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City receives an annual allocation of funds from the County's $5.00 Auto License Tax for Franklin County Engineer approved projects completed by the City on arterial streets within City limits; and\n \nWHEREAS, these funds are deposited into the City's County Auto License Tax Fund and are used to reimburse costs incurred by the Division of Traffic Management; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Traffic Management, Department of Public Service, in that an appropriation of funds is immediately necessary to allow these monies to be used for said purposes and to promote and reinforce efficient accounting practices and maintain prudent cash flow to division operating funds, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That from the unappropriated balance of the County Auto License Tax Fund (Fund 2264), and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, these funds are hereby authorized to be moved to the Street, Construction, Maintenance, and Repair Fund (Fund 2265) by internal billing. \n \nSECTION 2.  That all funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated in an amount not to exceed funds received from Franklin County in 2024, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in Section 2 shall be paid upon order of the Director of the Department of Public Service and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 4.   That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend these monies or so much thereof as may be needed to pay internal billings for Franklin County Engineer approved roadway construction and maintenance work undertaken by the Division of Traffic Management in and for the City of Columbus. \n \nSECTION 5.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
