    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Meacham & Apel Architects, Inc. DBA M+A Architects for the Adventure Center Renovations Design Project. The contract amount is $121,159.73, with a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $131,159.73 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Adventure Center serves the City’s Therapeutic Recreation and Adaptive Sports Club. These programs provide people with disabilities access to sports and recreation. Currently, the Adventure Center facility does not adequately enhance these programs. This project aims to make needed renovations to the Adventure Center's flooring, restrooms, front desk, and storage areas. The flooring will be level, non-slip, and conducive to adaptive sports. The restrooms will have ample spacing, multiple ADA and ambulatory stalls, and an adult changing station with amenities. The front desk improvements will enhance customer service, visibility, security, and aesthetics of the entrance. The storage areas will provide additional space to increase programming efficiency.\n \nThe project goes beyond compliance with ADA guidelines and aims to provide respect, inclusion, and dignity to all who enter and enjoy the Adventure Center. To avoid additional disruption to the facility programming, this project intends to start design by January 2024, enabling the Recreation and Parks Department to begin construction by the fall of 2024.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised to three pre-qualified A/E firms that were prequalified through the biannual Request for Statement of Qualification (RFSQ) process through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on November 09, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on November 17, 2023.  Request for proposals were sent to the following companies:\n \nMeacham & Apel Architects, Inc.
