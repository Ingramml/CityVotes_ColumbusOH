    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City’s Recreation and Parks Department (“CRPD”) is engaged in the acquisition of approximately 0.4 acres of greenspace in the West Franklinton community near West Park Avenue and West Broad Street from West Broad Street Missionary Chapel, {Franklin County Parcel numbers 010-008304, 010-025045, and 010-025046}. The City previously passed Ordinance Numbers 0389-2022 and 3022-2021 authorizing the Director of CRPD to apply for funding through OPWC, execute a grant with OPWC, and appropriate the grant funds for the purchase. This acquisition will expand the community’s West Park Median to over 5 acres, reaching from Sullivant Avenue to West Broad Street.  These sites will become protected passive greenspaces in the city’s most underserved community for parks and open space.  Further as a condition of the grant, the Director of CRPD will be required to place deed restrictions on the Real Estate, preserving the Real Estate as greenspace. This acquisition will add additional public greenspace adjacent to existing parkland; provide open space for trees; and increase passive recreation opportunities. CRPD has successfully negotiated a purchase contract for the purchase of the Real Estate and CRPD now requests the City Attorney’s Real Estate Division acquire the Real Estate in good faith and contract for associated professional services (e.g. surveys, title work, appraisals, etc.) as part of the purchase so that CRPD can timely complete the acquisition of the Real Estate.     \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Not applicable. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $540,000.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283 and Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this acquisition.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to acquire the Real Estate and meet the January 29, 2024 date for City Council approval in the purchase contract thereby allowing the Recreation and Parks Department to timely complete the Public Project without unnecessary delay, which will preserve the public peace, health, property, safety, and welfare. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to expend City funds to acquire and accept in good faith the real property consisting of an approximately 0.4 acres of greenspace in the West Franklinton community near West Park Avenue and West Broad Street; to contract for associated professional services in order for the Recreation and Parks Department to timely complete the acquisition of the property; to authorize the expenditure of $540,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund and Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
