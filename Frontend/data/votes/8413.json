    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to sign and enter into the LPA Federal Local-Let Project Agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to construct a section of the Olentangy Trail. This is ODOT Project 112036. \n \nThe project will construct a 0.6 mile trail segment of the Olentangy Trail, from Northmoor Park to Clinton Como Park. The LPA Agreement details the grant funding agreement and responsibilities of the Recreation and Parks Department (LPA) to bid, award, and administer the project. The Recreation and Parks Department was awarded a grant for over 5.4 million dollars from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) to assist towards construction of the Olentangy Trail, from Northmoor Park to Clinton Como Park. The required match dollars are expected to be approximately 2.3 million dollars and the total project is estimated to be approximately 7.7 million dollars. \n \nThe Olentangy Trail is Central Ohio’s most heavily used greenway trail. The project will construct a new crossing of the Olentangy River at Northmoor Park and travel along the west bank of the river. The Olentangy Trail has seen over one million users each year. The North Broadway section of the trail will have an enhanced bike and pedestrian crosswalk with signals and will continue along the river behind the Ohio Health campus on North Broadway. The trail will also continue south across the Olentangy River to Clinton Como Park, where it will rejoin the existing trail.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Transportation\n400 East William Street\nDelaware, OH  43015\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to obtain approval for the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to sign and enter into the LPA Agreement as it is required to be executed and submitted to ODOT in February of 2024.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Manual trail counts were conducted and found that the average yearly use of the Olentangy Trail by pedestrians and cyclists was approximately one million uses per year. The neighborhood strongly supports increased safety and access to the regional trail system with leads to jobs, parks, and downtown Columbus. This project completes the final section of the Olentangy Trail connecting more than 30,000 residents, 100 businesses, 6 parks, a regional hospital, medical campus, and 15 schools to the Olentangy Trail.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Clintonville Community has been actively involved in support of the project, including the Clintonville Area Commission, residents, and local businesses. There has been public engagement via the Recreation and Parks website and social media. Furthermore, Ohio Health, private developers, and trail users are also in support the project. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by providing expanded and equitable access to greenways, trails, and parks. \n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. Future legislation will accept, appropriate, and encumber funding for this project as needed.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to sign and enter into an LPA Federal Local-Let Project Agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to construct a section of the Olentangy Trail; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to sign and enter into the LPA Federal Local-Let Project Agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to construct a section of the Olentangy Trail.; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Recreation and Parks Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to sign and enter into the LPA Agreement as it is required to be executed and submitted to ODOT in February of 2024, all for the immediate preservation of public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
