    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into an agreement with Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District to provide funding to the organization to develop up to five (5) public restroom facility structures in the City of Columbus’ downtown for an amount not to exceed $875,000.  \n \nThere is currently limited access to public restrooms in the City’s downtown community. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased need for free and accessible public restrooms. The addition of free public restroom facilities in the City’s downtown will improve hygienic practices of visitors and the City’s transient population as we continue to recover from pandemic and mitigate the spread of the virus. With the return of conventions, sporting events, tourists and workers to the City this infrastructure will enhance the vibrancy of the area creating an accessible and welcoming environment.\n \nThe City of Columbus will complete an Environmental Review process, as well as a community planning process, before determining facility locations. \n \nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG) proceeds will be used to fund this agreement. Capital Crossroads will serve as a grant subrecipient and will carry out eligible project management related activities on behalf of the City. CDBG regulations 24 CFR §570.500(c) define a subrecipient as a public or private nonprofit agency, authority, or organization receiving CDBG funds from the recipient (or another subrecipient) to undertake eligible activities.
