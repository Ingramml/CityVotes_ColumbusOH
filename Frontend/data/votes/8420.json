    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement with The Homeless Families Foundation, one of seven not-for-profit social service agencies that were awarded within the 2023 Flourish Grant as part of the department’s Elevate 2.0 program. Additional ordinances will be forthcoming as part of this award for the other agencies.  The total awarded to these agencies is an amount up to $50,000.00 for a total award amount of $350,000.00 for the program.  The term of each Grant Agreement shall be from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n \nOn September 20, 2023, the Department of Development disseminated the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for the 2023 Flourish Grant, to the 112 Non-Profit agencies within the Elevate! Grant Program. The NOFA extended an invitation to these organizations to collaborate and apply for grants of up to $50,000.00 for fostering innovative partnerships to improve and strengthen the non-profits’ capacities which then will better serve their clients. The NOFA specified there was a total of $200,000.00 available. Later, $150,000.00 in additional funding was reallocated within the Department of Development, expanding the total funds available to $350,000.00.\n \nIn response, a total of eighteen proposals involving 43 non-profit organizations were received, collectively requesting $899,953.00. These submissions were subsequently narrowed down to 16, and each collaborating partner was invited to present their ideas during FlourishFest '23. This two-day event provided a platform for each collaboration to pitch their proposals and receive feedback from an audience comprising reviewers, fellow applicants, and guests. Each collaboration was instructed to incorporate that feedback into their final proposals, which were due on October 16, 2023. A seven-member review team was assembled and tasked with evaluating and scoring these proposals.\n \nThe proposal received from The Homeless Families Foundation, collaborating with Columbus Diaper Bank and Furniture Bank of Central Ohio, was one of the seven proposals selected by the review team to be funded by this initiative. The agencies will work together to support long-term housing and financial stability and cultivate transformational change for low-income and housing insecure families through an expansion of holistic, wrap-around services through the HFF Family Stability Program. The proposed funding will be allocated directly to The Homeless Families Foundation, but will be utilized by all agencies involved to further their collaboration and provide services to their constituents.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this expenditure is allocated within the Elevate 2.0 General Fund budget, in an amount up to $50,000.00 and is contingent upon the passage of Ordinance 3378-2023. ($50,000.00)\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 025439 and the expiration date is 9/7/2025\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Development to execute a grant agreement in an amount up to $50,000.00 with The Homeless Families Foundation, one of seven not-for-profit, social service agencies awarded funding, for the provision of human services programming for a 12 month period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, as part of the 2023 Flourish Grant; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; to authorize the expenditure of up to $50,000.00 from the Elevate 2.0 General Fund.
