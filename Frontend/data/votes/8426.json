    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus Public Health received funds for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Ordinance No. 2835-2023 authorized the Board of Health to enter into a contract with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. with targeted outreach  media services and campaigns for the program's awarded strategies. Contractor's Compliance number CC029262.\nThe City of Columbus’s Sexual Health Promotion Division desires to conduct outreach to build awareness and provide education regarding the importance of screening for persons at risk of HIV, as well as viral suppression and overall health promotion for persons living with HIV. \n \nThe services provided will assist and align with the shifted focus to initiatives in the fourth quarter of the grant cycle. Specifically, services are focused upon men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender and gender non-conforming communities, focusing on racial disparities and language barriers that exist within these communities.\n \nThese services were competitively bid through vendor services (RFQ22658) and Bonfire (Sexual Health Outreach Campaign) in August of 2022, according to bidding requirements of the City Code. The bid was awarded to the most responsive, lowest bidder. The original contract amount was $201,828.00 and is being increased by $50,000.00, thus making the new contract amount of $251,828.00. The contract modification was awarded using this RFQ due to the grant cycle ending on February 29, 2024. The increase in award was accessed and determined from successful markers being met during the grant cycle, effectively meeting programmatic initiatives defined by grantor. \nEmergency action is required to ensure the continued operation of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program. This is necessary to meet grant deliverables required by grantor and avoid risk of forfeiture of future funds.\nFISCAL IMPACT: This contract is entirely funded by a grant award from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). This grant does not generate revenue nor require a city match.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. for the provision of media related services for the period November 1, 2023 through February 29, 2024; to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health has received funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program; and\nWHEREAS, in order to ensure continued services provisions under the program, it is necessary to modify an existing contract with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. for the provision of media services and campaigns for the program's awarded strategies; and\nWHEREAS, the contract period is November 1, 2023 through February 29, 2024; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board to modify an existing contract with Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. to ensure the continued operation of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) grant program to allow Knupp & Watson & Wallman, Inc. to provide additional media services and campaigns related to EHE initiatives , to meet deliverables required by the grantor , U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
