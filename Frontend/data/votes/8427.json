    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus Public Health has been awarded a 1-month extension for the STI Prevention Grant Program from the Ohio Department of Health. This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to accept and appropriate an additional $114,584.00 in grant monies to fund STI Prevention Grant Program, for the period of January 1, 2023 through January 31, 2024. The new total award amount is $1,489,584.00. Underlying Ordinance for the STI Prevention grant program, referenced in Ordinance No. 3351-2022.\nThe STI Prevention grant program enables Columbus Public Health to identify and prevent sexually transmitted diseases through gonorrhea culture screening, syphilis elimination, gonococcal isolate surveillance, and partner services. Additionally, Columbus Public Health assures the quality of medical and laboratory services, surveillance, partner services, and data management. All activities are conducted with special emphasis on populations at high risk such as correction facilities, organizations focusing on adolescents, and managed care settings. \nEmergency action is requested to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system as soon as possible. Up to date financial posting promotes accurate accounting and financial management to meet deliverables required by grantor and reduces the risk of being in forfeiture of grant funds.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The STI Prevention grant program is entirely funded by the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City Match.
