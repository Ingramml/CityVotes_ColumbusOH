    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.                     BACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify (#2) an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007. The Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant creates large amounts of methane-rich digester biogas which is now burned in flares as a waste product.  A feasibility study showed that installing a cogeneration system can beneficially use this biogas as fuel to create electricity that will supply about half the total electricity the plant uses, with an acceptable payback period and significant overall reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The cogeneration system will be relatively large and complex.  This project also includes design work for replacing certain plant boilers at the end of their useful life and improvements to the CMT facilities. This renewal purchases the first portion of the Step 3 Engineering Services during Construction for this project.  Future legislation will purchase the remaining step 3 services during construction. Construction will be accomplished by others under a separate contract.  \n \n                     The construction work will occur at the Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant and has been designated as planning area 99, Citywide.\n \n1.1                     Modification Information: Amount of additional funds $1,299,989.00\n \nOriginal Contract (Preliminary Design)                          $1,025,883.00\nModification 1 (Ord. 2924-2018)                                          $ 2,309,950.00\nModification 2 (this mod)                                                                    $1,299,989.00\nModification 3 (future planned)                                           $1,907,793.00\nESTIMATED CONTRACT TOTAL                $ 6,543,615.00\n \n1.2                     Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification/renewal.\n \n1.3                     Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nRe-bid of the project will likely result in a higher project costs as much of the project history would be lost and would need to be rediscovered by another consultant unless the new RFP were won by the same consultant. In such a case, we would have missed significant time in acquiring and evaluating the new proposals without significant benefit.  \n \n1.4                     How cost of modification was determined:\nCosts were negotiated between the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and Arcadis US, Inc.\n \n2.                     PROJECT TIMELINE:  The Notice to Proceed for preliminary design was issued 8/22/2017.  That work was completed, and modification 1 for detailed design issued NTP on 1/22/2019.  That work is nearly completed now. This planned modification for phase 1 of step 3 services will extend through late 2021. A third modification is planned for late 2021 for phase 2 of the step 3 services during construction, which will complete all engineering work and will progress through the duration of construction.  The separate construction project is expected to be completed by fourth quarter of 2023, and all engineering work will also be complete at that time.\n \n3.   EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: Emergency action is not requested at this time\n \n4.   CONTRACT COMPLIANCE NO: 57-0373224| Exp. 3/18/2023 | DAX Vendor #009409\n \n5.   ECONOMIC / ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:  This project provides design work to install a cogeneration system that will use the facility’s biogas, now burned in flares as a waste product to create large amounts of electricity.  The updated lifecycle cost analysis from preliminary design show a savings in electrical costs, which helps to offset the capital and operating costs of the improvement.  A detailed feasibility study shows a large overall reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions.  The system will reduce overall greenhouse emissions by more than 4,000 tons a year of equivalent CO2. This project includes designing stormwater detention BMPs (Best Management Practices) and floodwater compensatory cut that is needed to meet previous stormwater commitments.  These improvements will help to protect the water quality of the Scioto River.\n \n6.   FISCAL IMPACT: This legislation authorizes the expenditure of up to $1,299,989.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant (JPWWTP) Cogeneration Project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,299,989.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Project with Arcadis was authorized by Ord 1329-2017; and\n \nWHEREAS, the original contract was modified by Ordinance 2924-2018; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify (#2) an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,299,989.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage, Department of Public Utilities, to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify  an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. for the JPWWTP Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007 for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1: That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify an existing professional engineering agreement with Arcadis US, Inc. 100 E. Campus View Blvd., Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43235 for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant Cogeneration Project, CIP 650250-100007 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract on file in the Office of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\nSECTION 2: That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to expend up to $1,299,989.00 from the Sanitary Sewer Bond Fund 6109 for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant Cogeneration Project Modification #2, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the said firm, Arcadis US, Inc. shall perform the work to the satisfaction of the Director of Public Utilities and the Administrator of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to transfer any unencumbered balance in the project account to the unallocated balance within the same fund upon receipt of certification by the Director of the Department administering said project that the project has been completed and the monies no longer required for said project; except that no transfer shall be made from a project account by monies from more than one source. \n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to establish proper project accounting numbers as appropriate.\n \nSECTION 6. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 7. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 8. That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
