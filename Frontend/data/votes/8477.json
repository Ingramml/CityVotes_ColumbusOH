    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Columbus City Council (“Council”), by Ordinance No. 2511-2020, passed November 23, 2020, authorized the City of Columbus (“City”) to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC ( the “Enterprise”, and also referred to as “MCC”), for a real property tax abatement of seventy-five percent (75%) for a period of ten (10) consecutive years in consideration of a proposed capital investment of approximately $9,200,000.00 in real property improvements, the creation of five (5) net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $175,000.00, and the retention or relocation of an unknown number of positions from within the City of Columbus or surrounding communities, related to the construction of a new 3-story speculative commercial office structure consisting of approximately 43,000 square feet on roughly 70 +/- acres of undeveloped land (the “Project”) located at 2130 Quarry Trails, Columbus, Ohio 43204 (the “Project Site”), parcel number 560-298029 (the “Original Parcel”). The Agreement was made and entered into effective August 12, 2021 (Agreement No. 023-21-19) with the Project expected to begin in the fall of 2020, with all real property improvements expected to be completed by December 2021, and with the abatement to commence no later than 2022 nor extend beyond 2031. \n \nParagraph fourteen within Section 6 (Program Compliance) of the Agreement states that the “Agreement is not transferable or assignable without the express, written, approval of the City” and paragraph fifteen of that same section states that “any requested amendment…to any of the terms of the Agreement…shall require the payment to the City by the Enterprise of an Amendment Fee in the amount of five-hundred dollars ($500.00).”\n \nIn a letter received by the City on behalf of the Enterprise dated January 6, 2022 and through ensuing correspondence, it was confirmed that the office building transitioned into an office condominium, with each of the three floors owned by the tenants. As a result of this transition, The Quarry Trails Office Condominium (“Quarry Trails”) was created on December 10, 2021. The three floors were conveyed to WAG ROCK, LLC (“WAG”), EPF 5, LLC (“EPF 5”), and Panacea Property Ventures, LLC (“Panacea”), and each entity has acquired ownership of the Project Site from Quarry Trails, with the transfer having been recorded at the County Recorder's Office on June 24, 2022 for WAG, on April 3, 2023 for EPF 5, and on August 18, 2022 for Panacea. Additionally, the Project Site has been revised to three separate parcels for each floor: Parcel Number 560-306039 for WAG, Parcel Number 560-306040 for EPF 5, and Parcel Number 560-306041 for Panacea (all split from the Original Parcel) containing approximately 70 +/- acres with a mailing address of 2130 Quarry Trails (1st Floor - 3rd Floor respectively), Columbus, Ohio 43204. \n \nDue diligence has been undertaken by the City in that Quarry Trails, WAG, EPF 5, and Panacea have agreed to collectively fully assume the terms and commitments of the Enterprise pursuant to the Agreement, have submitted updated Economic Development Incentive Applications, submitted the five-hundred dollars ($500.00) Amendment Fee, and that these applications and all other pertinent information have been reviewed and vetted.\n \nThis legislation is to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Agreement for the first time for Assignment & Assumption to (1) remove Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC, as Enterprise and party to the Agreement and to be replaced with  Quarry Trails, WAG, EPF 5, and Panacea, collectively known as the Enterprise and party to the Agreement, Quarry Trails, WAG, EPF 5, and Panacea will assume the terms and commitments of the Agreement, and (2) revise the description of the Project Site, and (3) revise the notice information related to Enterprise within Section 6 of the Agreement.   \n \nBased on the above, the Director of the Department of Development of the City has investigated the Economic Development Applications of WAG, EPF 5, and Panacea and concurs with the Columbus City Council on the basis that WAG, EPF 5, and Panacea are qualified by financial responsibility and business experience to create and preserve employment opportunities in the Columbus Enterprise Zone and improve the economic climate of the City.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Enterprise Zone Agreement for the first time for Assignment & Assumption with Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC, to remove Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC as Enterprise and party to the Agreement and to be replaced with WAG ROCK, LLC, EPF 5, LLC and Panacea Property Ventures, LLC, collectively as the Enterprise and party to the Agreement, to revise the Project Site description, and to revise the notice information related to the Enterprise.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus (“City”) entered into an Enterprise Zone Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC (hereafter referred to as “Enterprise”), approved by Columbus City Council (“Council”) on November 23, 2020 by Ordinance No.2511-2020; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Agreement granted a 75%/10-Year abatement on real property improvements; and\n \nWHEREAS, the incentive was granted in consideration of a proposed capital investment of approximately $9,200,000.00 in real property improvements, the creation of five (5) net new full-time permanent positions with an associated annual payroll of approximately $175,000.00, and the retention of relocation of an unknown number of positions from within the City of Columbus or surrounding communities, related to the construction of a new 3-story speculative commercial office structure consisting of approximately 43,000 square feet on roughly 70 +/- acres of undeveloped land (the “Project”) located at 2130 Quarry Trails, Columbus, Ohio 43204 (the “Project Site”), parcel number 560-298029 (the “Original Parcel”).
