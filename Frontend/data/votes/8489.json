    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department asking that the City extinguish and transfer a 2.538 acre portion of right-of-way from the Department of Public Service to the Recreation and Parks Department.  \n \nThe right-of-way area is located in Genoa Park; runs north/south directionally; runs through/adjacent to PID 010-067106.  Broad Street abuts at the north of the portion and W Town Street abuts at the south.  Extinguishing and transferring the right-of-way will facilitate improvements and enhancements to city-owned property; this right-of-way is within Park boundaries and should not exist as City right-of-way but should be under the control of the Recreation and Parks Department.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by extinguishing this right-of-way and transferring the asset among City Departments.  \n \nThe Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the asset as described and shown within the attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT:  \n \nThere is no cost to the City to transfer the right of way.\n \nTitle\n \nTo extinguish a 2.538 acre portion of right-of-way located in Genoa Park and transfer the asset to The City of Columbus, Recreation and Parks Department.
