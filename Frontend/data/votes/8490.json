    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security (USDHS) has issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), with $1 billion available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program.  The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program makes federal funds available to states, U.S territories, federally recognized tribal governments, and local communities for hazard mitigation activities. It does so with a recognition of the growing hazards associated with climate change, and of the need for natural hazard risk mitigation activities that promote climate adaptation and resilience with respect to those hazards. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in the future. The NOFO remains open through February 29, 2024.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application as a subrecipient through the Ohio Emergency Management Agency (Ohio EMA), which is part of the Ohio Department of Public Safety (ODPS).  City staff has spoken with Ohio EMA, and it is willing to submit an application requesting approximately $600,000.00 to purchase friction sensors for city staff to use to monitor roadway and weather conditions during winter weather events.  These sensors will allow city staff to respond to winter weather events as efficiently as possible.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to formally apply for a BRIC program grant as a subrecipient to Ohio EMA.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USDHS, ODPS, or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis grant may be used for up to seventy-five percent (75%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of material purchasing contracts, procurement contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to apply for a Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program Grant from the United States Department of Homeland Security; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Homeland Security and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Homeland Security (USDHS) announced FY 23 funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) Program, which is a grant program that includes funds to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\n \nWHEREAS, USDOT is accepting applications for the FY 2023 funding round through February 29, 2024; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City intends to partner with other interested stakeholders, including the Ohio Department of Public Safety, to submit a funding application to purchase friction sensors for city staff to use to monitor roadway and weather conditions during winter weather events; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application for a grant from USDHS’ FY 23 BRIC Program; to accept said grant, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said application, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to execute any agreement or other documents necessary to effectuate applying for and receiving BRIC program grant funding as a subrecipient through the Ohio Department of Public Safety.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 4.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
