($350,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with HDR Engineering, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - Multimodal Corridor - Mount Vernon Avenue - Hamilton Avenue to Taylor Avenue.\nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, the design of improvements to Mount Vernon Avenue within the King-Lincoln Bronzeville neighborhood. The planned limits along Mt. Vernon Avenue are from Hamilton Avenue to Taylor Avenue. The primary improvements consist of separated bike facilities. A two-way cycle track (also referred to as an on-road side path) is planned for most of the limits; except, where pavement width is narrower east of Phillips Street, a shared use path is planned. \nOrdinance 0688-2023  authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service, on behalf of the City of Columbus, to prepare and submit a Safe Routes to School Application to the Ohio Department of Transportation; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into grant agreements with ODOT, accept and expend grant funds, and issue refunds if necessary after final accounting is performed.\nOrdinance 0499-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the Roadway - Multimodal Corridor - Mount Vernon Avenue - Hamilton Avenue to Taylor Avenue project.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $350,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $350,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $400,000.00     (PO378949, Ord. 0499-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $350,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                            $750,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to allow additional resources to complete the design process.  The amount initially legislated for this project did not include the full amount that would be needed to fund this project.  Additional funding will be required to complete the design process.\n                     \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nHDR performed the study work for the entire corridor and the initial survey work for Phase 1 detailed design. This scope of work is a reasonable extension of their work from the study phase. There is also an accelerated design schedule due to the Safe Routes to School funding.  As a result, it was decided that it is in the best interest of the City to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by an internal review of the work proposed and the suggested hours proposed by the consultant. The fee is based on an appropriate estimate of the hours determined to be required for the proposed tasks.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against HDR Engineering, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for HDR Engineering, Inc. is CC008851 and expires 05/19/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis Contract was bid with an approved City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 17%.  Failure by the consultant to meet this goal subjects the consultant to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with HDR Engineering, Inc. in connection with the Roadway - Multimodal Corridor - Mount Vernon Avenue - Hamilton Avenue to Taylor Avenue project; and to authorize the expenditure of $350,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project.
