    "title": "To authorize the Board of Health to enter into contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., pharmaceutical distribution services for the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024; to waive the competitive bidding requirements; to authorize the expenditure of $70,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency.

    "description": "BACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health received funds from Franklin County Board of Commissioners for the FY24 Ben Franklin Tuberculosis (TB) grant program. Columbus Public Health (CPH) serves as the tuberculosis control unit for Franklin County. In that capacity, CPH serves as the local authority for all aspects of TB surveillance and reporting, medical management, and prevention and control activities in Franklin County.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into service contract for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., for 340B pharmaceutical distribution services in an amount not to exceed $70,000.00. This ordinance is contingent on the passing of Ordinance 0106-2024 to accept and appropriate the FY24 Ben Franklin Tuberculosis grant program.  \n \nThe Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) 340B Program enables covered entities to stretch scarce federal resources as far as possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services. Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. is the only 340B approved Contract Pharmacy in Central Ohio that supplies tuberculosis medications. Pharmacy services are currently ongoing with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., and a disruption to those services could be harmful to patients being treated at the Ben Franklin TB Clinic. Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., is familiar with TB clinic prescribing processes, including medication handling, compounding, invoicing, Medicaid billing reconciliation and distribution of 340B medications utilized by the clinic. \n \nCrosby’s Drugs, Inc. contract compliance number is CC-004573. \n \nThere is an immediate need for the continuation of contract tracing services to avoid disruption of disease prevention for the public safety. Crosby's Drugs, Inc. has been the provider of specialized, pharmaceutical distribution and provides storage of all CPH-owned 340B medications. There is a national shortage of TB medications due to loss of manufacturers, inefficient supply chains, and lack of active ingredients available for import which has caused the cost of these medications to increase. Crosby's Drugs is able to source these medications quickly which has increased the cost of TB medications. The previous contract did not require legislation per Columbus City Code and was below the threshold. CPH is requesting that the competitive bidding provisions outlined in Chapter 329.18 of the Columbus City Code be waived for this contract. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This contract is entirely funded by a grant award from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners.  This grant does not generate revenue nor require a city match.  ($70,000.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., pharmaceutical distribution services for the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024; to waive the competitive bidding requirements; to authorize the expenditure of $70,000.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency. ($70,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health has received funding from the Franklin County Board of Commissioners for the FY24 Ben Franklin Tuberculosis Program grant program; and\n \nWHEREAS, in order to ensure continued disease prevention services under the program, it is necessary to enter into a contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc. for pharmaceutical distribution services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract period is January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the Columbus Public Health Department to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board to enter into a contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., to ensure the continued operation of pharmaceutical distribution of TB medications to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in Franklin County which contract will help to address a national supply chain shortage of TB medications, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare, and; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with Crosby’s Drugs, Inc., for the FY24 Ben Franklin Tuberculosis Program grant program, for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024.\n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the cost of said contract, the expenditure of $70,000.00 is hereby authorized from the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, Department No. 50, Division 5001, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
