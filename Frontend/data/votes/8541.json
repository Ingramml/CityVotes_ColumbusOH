($1.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: On November 5, 2018, City Council passed Ordinance 2978-2018, authorizing the Finance and Management Director to establish a Universal Term Contract (UTC) for the option to obtain Bill Presentment services with Level One LLC. The term authorized in the ordinance was for two (2) years from the contract execution.  The contract was able to be extended for up to four additional two (2) year periods, subject to mutual agreement by both parties. This would have allowed for a maximum of a ten (10) year contract.\nThe actual signed contract PO149627, has a term of five (5) years, with the option to extend annually up to an additional five (5) years. Although both the ordinance and the contract allow for a maximum of a ten (10) year contract, the original signed term was not in accordance with the legislative authorization. This was done through human error.\nBecause this error has caused the original contract to lapse, an ordinance is necessary to re-establish the UTC by entering into a new contract with Level One LLC. A bid waiver is requested to re-establish this contract.\nBid Information:  The Purchasing Office advertised and solicited competitive bids in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 relating to competitive bidding.  RFQ006999 was advertised and Proposals were received on November 2, 2017.  Seven (7) responses were received. Due to the expiration of the original contract, and the age of the original RFP, a bid waiver is requested.\nTotal estimated annual expenditures: the City has expended approximately $926,000 per year during the contract.\nEmergency action is requested so that the Public Utilities Department can continue Bill Presentment services with minimal interruption. \nFiscal Impact:  Funding to re-establish this $1 option contract will be authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002253.  City agencies will be required to obtain approval to expend from their own appropriations for their estimated annual expenditures.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract with Level One, LLC for the option to purchase bill presentment services; to authorize the expenditure of $1.00; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency. ($1.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, there is a need to purchase Bill Presentment Services for the Divisions of Water and Electricity, as well as other divisions; and\nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office advertised and solicited proposals on November 2, 2017, receiving seven (7) responses; and \nWHEREAS, City Council approved the establishment of a Bill Presentment Contract with Level One, LLC, through Ordinance 2978-2018; and \nWHEREAS, through human error, a contract was signed with incorrect terms, and\nWHEREAS, it is therefore necessary to re-establish the UTC by entering into a new contract for a one (1) year term, with the option to extend annually up to an additional four (4) years, and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes, and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to re-establish the UTC which was terminated by human error by entering into a new contract for the purchase of Bill Presentment services with Level One, LLC for use by the Water and Electricity Divisions all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to re-establish an option contract for Bill Presentment services with Level One, LLC by entering into a new contract with Level One, LLC in accordance with solicitation RFQ006999 for a term expiring one (1) year from execution of the new contract. The contract may be extended for up to four (4) additional one (1) year periods, subject to mutual agreement by both parties, as follows:\nLevel One, LLC, Negotiated Contract, $1.00\nSECTION 2. That the expenditure of $1.00 is hereby authorized from General Budget Reservation BRPO002253 of this ordinance to pay the cost thereof.\nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\nSECTION 4. That the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes are hereby waived.\nSECTION 5. That for the reason stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be and emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
