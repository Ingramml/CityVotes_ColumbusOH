    "description": "Title\n \nTo recognize the American Heart Association’s Centennial anniversary and to support the recognition of Friday, February 2, 2024 as National Wear Red Day® and February as “American Heart Month”.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S, is the leading cause of death in women, claiming more lives than all forms of cancer combined, and is the leading cause of maternal death in the U.S., yet only 44% of women recognize that cardiovascular disease is their greatest health threat; and \nWHEREAS, there are significant biological differences between men and women that impact heart disease, and in 2020, stroke caused the deaths of 90,627 females, approximately 56.5% of total stroke deaths; and\nWHEREAS, among females 20 years and older, nearly 45% are living with some form of cardiovascular disease and less than half of women entering pregnancy in the United States have optimal cardiovascular health; and\n \nWHEREAS, most cardiac and stroke events can be prevented through education and lifestyle changes, such as moving more, eating smart and managing blood pressure; and\n \nWHEREAS, the American Heart Association has provided one hundred years of essential lifesaving research and advocacy for healthy communities, enhanced patient care, and equitable health access for everyone; and\n \nWHEREAS, since 2004, the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women® movement has addressed the awareness and clinical care gaps of women’s greatest health threat, cardiovascular disease, and, on the cusp of the American Heart Association’s 100th anniversary, continues to make bold moves to save lives and pioneer scientific discoveries; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nThat this Council does hereby recognize the importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease and stroke, commends the life-saving contributions of the American Heart Association to advocacy, scientific research, and the development of treatments to end heart disease, and does hereby proclaim Friday, February 2, 2024, to be NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY® and the month of February to be American Heart Month in Columbus, Ohio.",
