This ordinance will allow for a temporary delegation of authority to the Director of the Finance and Management Department to execute such facility rental license agreements without Council approval until August 1, 2024 to afford Council the opportunity to review these matters and consider such a change in City Code.  Consequently, this ordinance waives provisions of Section 329.33 of the Columbus City Codes and temporarily authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to execute facility rental license agreements of under thirty (30) days duration, as approved by the Department of Law, with providers of services or with groups associated with department community relations initiatives to allow temporary occupancy of city-owned property for events for the benefit of City employees and the general public.\n \nFiscal Impact: Any income generated will be accounted for and deposited in the appropriate fund as determined by the Director of the Finance and Management Department.\n \nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested to allow for the immediate execution of facility rental license agreements to allow previously scheduled events to proceed without delay for the preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into facility rental  license agreements with providers of services or with groups associated with department community relations initiatives to allow for temporary occupancy of city-owned property for events for the benefit of City employees and the general public; to waive provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency ($0.00)\nBody\n \nWHEREAS, City Departments from time-to-time request that providers of services or groups associated with department community relations initiatives to temporarily occupy city-owned property for events for the benefit of City employees and the general public; and\n \nWHEREAS, until a change in City Code can be authorized by City Council, it is in the best interest of the City that the authority to execute facility rental license agreements without Council approval is temporarily granted to the Director of Finance and Management; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary that the Director of Finance and Management enter into facility rental license agreements to allow for the temporary occupancy of city-owned property by providers of services or groups associated with department community relations initiatives for events or provision of services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Finance and Management Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into and execute facility rental license agreements to allow for the temporary occupancy of city-owned property for events or provision of services for the benefit of City employees and the general public all for the preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
