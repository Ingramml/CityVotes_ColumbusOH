    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to re-establish the encumbrance associated with the professional service contract with Futurety, LLC, approved by ordinance 2127-2023 on July 24, 2023.  This contract modification is a continuation of the services included within the original contract’s scope of service and is necessary to correct an accounting error with the original contract encumbrance.\n \nOrdinance 2127-2023 authorized the Director of the Department of Development to waive the competitive procurement requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 and to enter into a professional services contract with Futurety LLC, in an amount up to $100,000.00 for the purpose of web application development, digital marketing campaign management, analysis, and reporting.  Approval was also provided for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting July 1, 2023.\nDue to an error in the creation of the original encumbrance for this contract, the encumbrance was cancelled upon the processing of the first invoice.  This contract modification will re-establish an encumbrance for the remaining balance of $34,490.00.  The contract scope and terms will not change.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is required to allow for immediate payment of an outstanding invoice submitted according to the current contract, but unable to be processed until the encumbrance for the remainder of the contract amount is established. \n \n FISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Neighborhood Economic Development fund (2237).\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 025972 and expires 07/07/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a professional service contract with Futurety, LLC; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $34,490.00 from the Neighborhood Economic Development fund; and to declare an emergency.
