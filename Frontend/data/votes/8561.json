    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Dynotec, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Bikeway Development - Tussing Road SUP Brice Road to Hines Road project.\nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus with the design for a new shared use path (SUP) along the south side of Tussing Road from Brice Road to Hines Road.\nOrdinance 1794-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Dynotec, Inc. for the Bikeway Development - Tussing Road SUP Brice Road to Hines Road project.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $90,000.00. \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $90,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $722,304.00     (PO284304, Ord. 1794-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                        $90,000.00     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:              $812,304.00   \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nWhen Task 2 was authorized, it was identified that the project had a $50,000 shortfall in funding, so R/W Plans were moved to \"If-Authorized\" so the immediately necessary work could proceed.  Stage 1 comments led to the need for additional work that has already been authorized including: a)SUL-A's to be performed (in the amount of approximately $20,000), and b) the addition of Water Works Plans (in the amount of approximately $20,000) for waterline relocations. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nDynotec is prime consultant on the Tussing Road SUP Project. The amount being requested is for the consultant and project team to perform the following services: a) R/W Plan development, b) temporary R/W staking, c) setting R/W pins after construction, d) pedestrian signal upgrades, and e) on-going services during bidding & construction.  All of these services are integrally related to the design process for which they are currently tasked.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nDynotec and subconsultants provided a cost breakdown for each task included in the scope. After several negotiations, the final fee was determined to be in line with what is expected for the scope of work and the design timeline. Costs were also compared to other recent design project of similar scope and magnitude.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Dynotec, Inc. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Dynotec, Inc. is CC005053 and expires 4/18/24.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is budgeted and available within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  Funds are been appropriated.\n \n4.
