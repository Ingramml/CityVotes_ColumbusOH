    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the existing Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC (“Lyft”) to support the continued operation of CoGo Bike Share.  \n \nThe City of Columbus has provided financial support to CoGo Bike Share since its inception. \n \nOrdinance 2241-2012 authorized the execution of the City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement, between the Department of Recreation and Parks and Alta Bicycle Share, Inc., to facilitate the development, installation, operation, and management of a public bike share system, which launched on July 30, 2013, with 30 stations and 300 bikes. Since that time, CoGo Bike Share has grown to 88 stations and more than 600 bikes throughout the City, offering a low-cost option for alternative transit and personal recreation resulting in more than 50,000 rides annually. \n \nOrdinance 1572-2019 authorized the execution of the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Recreation and Parks and Motivate International, formerly known as Alta Bicycle Share, Inc., to facilitate the continued operation of CoGo Bike Share through July 1, 2024. \n \nOrdinance 2311-2021 authorized the execution of the First Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Recreation and Parks and Lyft, which acquired Motivate International, Inc. \n \nOrdinance 0950-2023 authorized the execution of the Second Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Public Service, which assumed responsibility for supporting CoGo Bike Share from the Department of Recreation and Parks pursuant to that legislation, and Lyft.  \n \nOrdinance 2048-2023 authorized the execution of the Third Modification to the Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement between the Department of Public Service and Lyft to provide financial support to CoGo Bike Share through the end of 2023. \n \nThe purpose of this legislation is to fund the ongoing operation of that program through at least the first half of 2024. This ordinance is being submitted in accordance with relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:                                          \nThe total amount of additional funding needed for the proposed contract modification is $600,000.00, which will sustain operations through the first half of 2024.\n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThe Department of Public Service expected to have modify the existing Amended and Restated City of Columbus Bike Share Agreement with Lyft periodically after assuming responsibility for supporting CoGo Bike Share. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt is more cost effective for the Department of Public Service to continue to allow Lyft to oversee the operation of CoGo Bike Share through the end of the current contract term.   \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe funding needed to support the proposed contract modification was calculated based on the current monthly operational costs for the CoGo Bike Share program attributable to the City. \n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Lyft Bikes and Scooters LLC is 040364, which expires December 19, 2025. \n \n3. FISCAL IMPACT \nFunding in the amount of $600,000.00 has been allocated within the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund to support the continued operation and management of CoGo Bike Share. This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3012-2023. \n \n4.
