The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $44,615.73.\n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department is responsible for the operation of forty-six City of Columbus buildings which contain mechanical HVAC systems. These buildings include community centers, athletic complexes, golf course clubhouses, and cultural arts centers. Many of these systems are failing and at the end of usability. This project will replace air handlers, boilers, condensers, furnace units, fans, ductwork, and associated systems that are identified as failure critical and in poor condition.\n \nThis second modification of the design contract will add replacement of HVAC control systems to Cleo Dumaree Athletic Complex and the Franklin Park Adventure Center. The controls in these facilities are failing and should be upgraded as part of this equipment upgrade project. This additional project scope overlaps with work currently underway by Advanced Engineering Consultants, LTD which would yield significant efficiencies.\n \nIt was not anticipated at the time this contract was started that the building automation systems at these facilities were going to fail. However, with HVAC projects being undertaken at these locations in the original contract, Advanced Engineering Consultants, LTD is positioned to deliver the additional work in a manner that will not affect the already established completion date.
