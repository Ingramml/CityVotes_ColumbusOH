    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resource (ODNR) for the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor Park to Clinton Como Park Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of the grant and matching funds. The grant amount is $435,000.00 and the local match amount is $145,000.00. There is a total of $580,000.00 available for this project being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) accepted the Recreation and Parks application for the Clean Ohio program. The Clean Ohio grant is a reimbursable grant that supports projects for the construction of new trails or connector-trail development. In March of 2023, Recreation and Parks applied for Clean Ohio Trail Funds to be put towards construction funds for the project, Ordinance 0751-2023.\nThis project will complete this final trail gap by constructing a crossing of the Olentangy River at Northmoor Park and travel along the west bank of the river. At North Broadway, the trail will use a new, fully functional bike and pedestrian crosswalk with signal. To accommodate the increase of overall Olentangy Trail use, the new pavement will be 12 feet to 14 feet wide. This is being constructed as part of the North Broadway and 315 interchange improvements for the new Ohio Health campus. The trail then continues south and crosses the river to Clinton Como Park, where it rejoins the existing trail. The Olentangy Trail is Central Ohio’s most used greenway trail. Recent trail count data shows over 1 million users per year travel on this path.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources\n2045 Morse Road, Building B\nColumbus, Ohio 43229                                                 \nMarlin Holloway, (614) 265-6471                                                                                                     \nContract Compliance Number: 005089\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so that the Director of Recreation and Parks can immediately sign the grant agreement and accept the funding to meet the grant acceptance deadline.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year-round benefits to urban lifestyles.

The department will continue to seek support and input throughout the project.  The department has received letters of support from the Clintonville Area Commission, Ohio Health, private developers, the community, and trail users.\n \nArea(s) Affected: \nCitywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors while providing safe connections to the regional trail network for nearby neighborhoods.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $435,000.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283.
