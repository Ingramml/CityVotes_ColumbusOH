    "title": "To authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify, by extension, the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. by 365 days (03/01/2024 - 02/28/2025) for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; and to declare an emergency.",
    "description": "…Explanation\nThis ordinance is to authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission (Commission) to modify the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. (Mount Carmel) by executing the first of two available extensions of the contract expiration date per RFQ023538 for pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming Police and Fire Academy classes through the beginning of 2025. \n \nIn accordance with City Code Section 329.09, the Commission needs to request authority to modify our current contract with Mount Carmel in order to extend the expiration date by 365 days, to 02/28/2025, as optioned in RFQ023538. No additional funding is needed as part of this modification request since funding for this wave of services is covered by existing appropriated funds and additional funds expected to be available and appropriated with the passage of the City’s 2024 General Fund Budget. \n \nSince this is a professional services contract that has already been awarded through the regular Request for Proposals process (see below), the contract’s requirements cannot be awarded through other procurement processes.  Pricing for the assessments to be provided during the 03/01/2024 thru 02/28/2025 period is in accordance with bid pricing previously submitted by Mount Carmel for 2024-26 services.\n \nBid Information: In 2022, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission published a Request for Proposals (RFQ023538) for these services and accepted proposals through December 2, 2022. Three proposals were submitted by the deadline.  An evaluation committee reviewed these proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFQ and the Executive Director selected and executed a contract with the selected vendor, Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc., via Ordinance 3084-2022.  Because the resulting contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. can be valid through 2026 if renewed by the City, re-bidding for these services at this time is not required or needed.  Pricing for the contracted services were determined via the RFQ process and were subsequently memorialized in the contract with the vendor. \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is requested in order to extend the contract immediately so that needed medical assessment services can be completed for police and fire academy classes scheduled for 2024.\n \nContract Compliance Number: CC-005227, expires 09/21/2025. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for this wave of services is covered by funds previously appropriated and encumbered, and additional funds expected to be available and appropriated with the passage of the City’s 2024 General Fund Budget, Ordinance 3011-2023. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission to modify, by extension, the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. by 365 days (03/01/2024 - 02/28/2025) for the administration of pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress testing of public safety recruits; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus Civil Service Commission accepted proposals from qualified companies for medical services; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission awarded the contract to Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. based upon the submissions of RFQ023538; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to modify, by extension, the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to extend the contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. in order to continue scheduling public safety recruits in preparation for upcoming academy classes, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Executive Director of the Civil Service Commission be and is hereby authorized to modify, by extension, the current contract with Mount Carmel Health Providers, Inc. by 365 days for the purpose of administering pre-employment physicals and cardiovascular stress tests to public safety recruits for the Department of Public Safety’s police and fire entry-level sworn positions.\n \nSECTION 2. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this modification is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City’s financial records.\n \nSECTION 3. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
