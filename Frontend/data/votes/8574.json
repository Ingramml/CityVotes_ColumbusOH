    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Childhood League, Inc. in an amount up to $50,000.00 to provide permanent infrastructure improvements to existing facilities.  Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting March 1, 2023, which expenses include various building structural repairs including (among others) roof leaks, compressor board replacements, etc.  The grant agreement will include an advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule.\n \nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is to create access to a high-quality pre-kindergarten education for every 4-year-old. Addressing early childhood learning means bringing awareness and resources to a critical learning stage in childhood development. Children who come to school ready to learn are more likely to succeed academically and in life.\n \nChildren who participate in high-quality pre-kindergarten experiences significantly improve their early literacy, language, and math skills. Ample evidence shows that children who enter school unprepared fall farther and farther behind. Students who get a poor start in their earliest years are likely to struggle in high school and subsequently, fail to graduate.\n \nQuality facilities are a fundamental cornerstone in delivering high-quality pre-kindergarten education. A well-maintained facility not only enhances the physical safety of the children but also contributes to their overall well-being and engagement. Upkeep also extends the longevity of equipment and infrastructure, making it a cost-effective investment in the long run. By prioritizing the maintenance and enhancement of pre-kindergarten facilities, we are making a commitment to the future of our children, providing them with an optimal setting for early development and learning.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the General Permanent Improvement Fund.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 017168 and contract compliance is pending.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Childhood League, Inc.; to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the General Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; and to authorize the reimbursement of expenditures incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order.
