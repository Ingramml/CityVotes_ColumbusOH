    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with EMH&T Incorporated (EMH&T), for professional services for the design of the Circuit 79 Street Lighting Improvements project, CIP #670897-100000, in an amount up to $127,961.81. \n                      \nThis project consists of a new design to completely replace all streetlight material for approximately 46 lights on Circuit 079 including: poles, luminaires, cable, conduit, pull boxes, and other associated material as required.  The existing lights are underground poles but subject to frequent maintenance and failure. The intent is to completely remove all existing Circuit 079 materials and install a new underground 3-wire streetlight circuit utilizing post top poles and LED luminaires.  The design process will develop a new street lighting circuit layout based on the measurement of light intensity using current Division of Power specifications.  The upgrade to LED lighting is more energy efficient and will result in an energy consumption savings for the City of Columbus.\n \nThe Community Area is 57 - Near East, with work occurring on streets south of I-670 and east of Saint Clair Avenue.\n \nTIMELINE:  Assuming approval of contract legislation by January 29, 2024, the Notice To Proceed (NTP) would be issued around March 11, 2024 based on typical project schedules and timelines.  \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $127,961.81, including a 10%  design contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time.  \n                     \nOriginal Contract                                               $ 127,961.81\n                     Future Anticipated Needs                          $          0.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $ 127,961.81\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project will design the replacement of existing street lighting material  on existing city lighting circuit 079 including poles, luminaires, cable, conduit, pull boxes, and other associated material as required. With the removal of existing material and upgrade to current lighting standards, the project will provide the community with more reliable lighting, as the existing material is dated and presents repeated maintenance issues.  The project will also upgrade the lighting to LED, which has proven to be more energy efficient.  This will result in an energy consumption savings for the City of Columbus\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites and closed 10/20/23.   One proposal was received:\n \nName                     C.C.
