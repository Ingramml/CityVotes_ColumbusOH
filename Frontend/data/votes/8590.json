    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with American Structurepoint to add additional funds for design of the ASR - Hamilton Rd from SR161 to Central College Road.\nThe intent of this contract is to provide the City of Columbus with traffic analysis, preliminary engineering documents, and detailed design plans for improvements to Hamilton Road which is anticipated to include reconstruction and widening along with the installation of new curb, sidewalks, shared use path, storm sewer, street lighting, street trees, and traffic signals along Hamilton Road from the SR161 interchange to Central College Road.  Improvements also include modifications to the eastern interchange ramps at SR161, capacity improvements to Hamilton Road through the interchange, and installation of pedestrian and bicycle facilities south to the northern E. Dublin-Granville Road intersection.\n \nOrdinance 1219-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with American Structurepoint for the ASR - Hamilton Rd from SR161 to Central College Road project.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $1,400,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $1,400,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $   500,000.00                     (PO227983, Ord. 1219-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $1,400,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                             $1,900,000.00\n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification that is necessary to allow additional resources to complete the design process.  The amount initially legislated for this project did not include the full amount that would be needed to fund this project through final design and construction services.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis is a planned modification to allow for additional work as funds became available.  The amount being requested is for the consultant and project team to complete final design phases.  It was decided that it is in the best interest of the Ciy to modify the existing contract instead of bidding this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe consultant submitted a detailed fee proposal with a scope of services that was reviewed and evaluated by Division of Design and Construction staff. The effort included for the tasks included in the scope of services were compared to industry standards, previous projects with similar scope, and guidance from the Ohio Department of Transportation to determine if the effort is fair and reasonable for the approved scope of improvements.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against American Structurepoint.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for American Structurepoint is CC007019 and expires 6/12/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $1,328,700.00 is available within the Northeast Corridor Pay as We Grow Fund, Fund 7772 within the Department of Development.  A transfer of cash is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. Funds will need to be appropriated.\n \nThe remaining funding, in the amount of $71,300.00, is available within the Northwest Corridor Pay as We Grow Fund, Fund 7771 within the Department of Development.  Funds will need to be appropriated and transferred to Fund 7772, Northeast Corridor Pay as We Grow Fund.  Funds will need to be appropriated in Fund 7772.\n \n \n4.
