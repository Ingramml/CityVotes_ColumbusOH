The RAISE Fund Program is accepting applications for funding to implement critical passenger transportation infrastructure improvements. If awarded, the funding will be used to construct a portion of the Linden Green Line Linear Park.  \n \nThe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is accepting grant applications for the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) Fund Program. The grant offers assistance to governmental agencies to complete critical freight and passenger transportation infrastructure, including mobility and community connectivity projects that help remove barriers to opportunity. Grant applications are due February 28, 2024. The notification of the grant acceptance will be awarded by June 27, 2024. \n \nIn October of 2023, Ordinance 2662-2023 authorized the acquisition of the rail corridor providing a transformative opportunity for over 131,000 residents living nearby to create a unique large-scale linear park through a dense inner city community. The purpose of the Linden Green Line project is to provide a new 58-acre linear park stretching along seven miles of an abandoned rail corridor to one of the region’s most underserved areas for parks, open spaces, and natural areas. It will range from Windsor Park, near 17th Avenue, to Cooper Park in the Northland community. The Linden Green Line Linear Park also passes through the center of what will become one of the region’s premier sports parks, Kilbourne Run, now under development by Recreation and Parks and planned to open in 2025.\n \nThe Linden Green Line Linear Park will include seven miles of pathway, the restoration of the surrounding natural area, and some small-scale amenities. The natural area restoration includes tree plantings, native shrubs, wildflowers, and selective open greenspaces. \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nFederal Highway Administration\n1200 New Jersey Ave, SE\nWashington, DC 20590                                             \nAndrea Jacobson, (202) 366-9603                                                                                                 \nContract Compliance Number: 035317\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested to meet the application deadline of February 28, 2024. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The Linden Green Line will create the first linear park in Central Ohio, providing active transportation and easily accessible greenspace.
