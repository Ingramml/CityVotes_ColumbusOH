    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify an agreement with and provide additional funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) relative to the FRA-3-19.92 (Westerville Rd) project, PID 106260.  \n \nThe aforementioned effort, which is slated to commence in the spring of 2024, encompasses various improvements to the stretch of SR-3 from Cleveland Avenue to SR-161, including resurfacing, pavement widening, and bridge work. \n \nOrdinance 0526-2023, which passed on March 6, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with ODOT for the FRA-3-19.92 (Westerville Rd) project, PID 106260. \n \nOrdinance 3095-2023, which passed on December 11, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute a contribution agreement or other instrument with ODOT relative to the aforementioned project and the encumbrance and expenditure of up to $594,070.00 to support the local share of estimated construction costs. \n \nHowever, when ODOT let the project on January 11, 2024, the apparent low bid substantially exceeded the original cost estimate, prompting ODOT to seek more funding from the Department of Public Service to support completion of the project. The purpose of this legislation is to enable the Department of Public Service to satisfy its additional financial obligations related to that effort. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of up to $149,920.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service to support the local share of estimated construction costs. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary for the purpose of providing sufficient cash and spending authority for the aforementioned expenditure.\n \n3.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nODOT is a political subdivision of the State of Ohio. As such, City of Columbus MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements are not applicable. \n \n4.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to enable the Department of Public Service to make payment to ODOT as soon as reasonably practicable in order to maintain the project schedule established by ODOT and to promote highway safety. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department Public Service to modify an agreement with and to provide additional funding to the Ohio Department of Transportation relative to the FRA-3-19.92 project, PID 106260; to authorize the expenditure of $149,920.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to support the aforementioned project; and to declare an emergency.
