With the extension, the additional time will allow People Like Me to operate the program in a newly selected venue that will be consistently available for the basketball programming. It will also allow for summer youth programming. This legislation will extend the agreement term to August 30, 2024.\n \nPeople Like Me provides a transformative community-based learning initiative to local youth, ages 10 to 16, through The Outlet Basketball program. Through meticulously designed curriculum and expert coaching staff, People Like Me provides participants with an immersive experience that not only enhances their basketball skills but cultivates valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, resilience, and leadership.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to allow the grant modification to be executed before the existing grant term expires.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to modify a grant agreement with People Like Me Project, Inc. to extend the agreement term for the Outlet Basketball program and to declare an emergency.
