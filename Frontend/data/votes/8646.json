    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services (BZS) to modify contract PO383621 with Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO) by adding $2,000.00 to be used for solid waste disposal services utilized by the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program to protect the health and safety of the citizens of Columbus. BZS pursued a request for quotation (RFQ) in 2023, and the only bidder could not fulfill the City's contract certification requirement. SWACO does not bid on landfill services, as it is a governmental entity tasked with managing the solid waste generated by the Franklin County Solid Waste Management District, which includes the City of Columbus. SWACO determines its tipping fee rates through an established rate-setting process in which the City of Columbus participates. BZS anticipated a supplemental contract award from the RFQ when it executed PO383621. Therefore, this contract requires additional funding to maintain uninterrupted service and reach its expiration date of April 30, 2024. Meanwhile, BZS will pursue another RFQ for future services.\n \nOriginal Contract Amount (PO383621)                                          $4,000.00\nModification                                                                                                         $2,000.00\nTotal Contract Amount                                                                                    $6,000.00\n \nThis contract supports the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program, which helps the community by mowing and clearing solid waste from public and private sites the Code Enforcement Division deems in violation of the City’s Environmental Health codes (Title 7) when owners fail to comply with Notices of Violation.\n \nEmergency Designation: The Department of Building and Zoning Services respectfully requests this legislation to be considered an emergency ordinance to ensure the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement program can continue to preserve the community’s health and safety without interruption.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The Department of Building and Zoning Services budgeted $40,000 in the 2024 General Fund Budget for these expenditures. This ordinance is contingent upon the passage of the 2024 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3011-2023.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify a contract with Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO); to authorize an expenditure from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($2,000.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services desires to modify a contract with SWACO by increasing the maximum obligation of the contract by $2,000.00 due to the unexpected lack of other vendors available to provide this service in 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is the responsibility of the Weed & Solid Waste Abatement Program to remove high grass and solid waste from properties deemed in violation of Title 7 of Columbus City Code; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to contract for tipping fees and landfill services to support the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, funds are budgeted within the Department of Building and Zoning Services, Division of Code Enforcement, General Fund budget for these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to modify a contract with SWACO to provide the funding necessary for continuing the Weed and Solid Waste Abatement Program’s services without interruption, and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, safety, and property; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.                      That the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services is hereby authorized to modify contract PO383621 with Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO) for an additional $2,000.00.\n \nSECTION 2.                       That the expenditure of $2,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), Dept-Div 4301 (Code Enforcement), in Object Class 03 (Purchased Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSee Attached File: Ord. 0074-2024 Attachment.xls\n \nSECTION 3.                       That this modification is made in accordance with the relevant provisions of the City Code Chapter 329 relating to contract modifications.\n \nSECTION 4.  That upon passage of the 2024 Operating Budget, funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n                     \nSECTION 5.                       That for the reasons stated in the Preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
