Funding will be advanced to the agency on a predetermined schedule.\n \nThe YMCA of Central Ohio provides affordable housing and wrap around services to chronically homeless individuals at 40 W. Long Street facility. In October 2021, the YMCA of Central Ohio received a $2,000,000.00 grant from the City of Columbus to begin the process of relocating tenants due to ongoing maintenance costs and the anticipated sale of the building.

Long Street. Due to the extended construction time line for the completion of the projects, McKinley Manor and Touchstone Place II, the Department of Development is committed to providing additional funding in the amount of $162,000.00 dollars to ensure that the residents who were relocated from the 40 W. Long St. facility remain housed until their permanent unit is available.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The funding of $162,000.00 has been allocated from the Administration Division’s 2024 General Fund Budget, this ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3012-2023.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s contract compliance number is 006085 and expires on 2/23/2024, and is in the process of being updated.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Young Men’s Christian Association to provide funding for rental support to the tenants during this final phase of the relocation project, which will begin on February 1, 2024; and to authorize the expenditure of $162,000.00 from the 2024 General Fund Operating Budget.
