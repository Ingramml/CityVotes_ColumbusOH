    "description": "...Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to accept and implement a twelve-month No-Cost Extension (NCE) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the CDC Health Disparities Grant for a new grant period of June 01, 2021 to February 28, 2025 and to modify two existing contracts for wayfinding services at Columbus Public Health. \n \nThe contract with Wa Fi LLC dba PLANIT Studios, entered into on April 1, 2023, will have their contract term extended from an original end date of February 29, 2024 to a new end date of May 31, 2024. Contract compliance number is CC032344 and the underlying contract was solicited and awarded via Vendor Services RFQ according to City Code. All other contract terms will remain in effect. \n \nThe contract with Quality Custom Signs LLC, entered into on November 20, 2023, will have their contract term extended from an original end date of February 29, 2024 to a new end date of May 31, 2024. Contract compliance number is CC030568 and the underlying contract was authorized by Ordinance 2973-2023. All other contract terms will remain in effect. \n \nA twelve-month NCE is needed to adequately collect and analyze data from community partners that will allow Columbus Public Health to better assess the overall impact of partners’ programming as well as identify novel practices for engaging various priority populations and sustaining partnerships to address health disparities beyond the grant period. \n \nIn addition, this NCE and modification of existing contracts with PLANIT Studios and Quality Custom Signs is needed to allow for sufficient time to implement the Columbus Public Health Wayfinding Project. This Wayfinding Project, being implemented by Quality Custom Signs with oversight from PLANIT Studios, will significantly increase the overall accessibility of the Columbus Public Health clinic spaces and services for clients we serve, with a focus on linguistic appropriateness, physical accessibility and overall organizational health literacy. \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to implement the NCE and complete the Wayfinding Project prior to the end of the original grant and contract period of February 29, 2024. Columbus Public Health was not able to request authorization sooner as the NCE was not awarded until January 11, 2024 as shown in the NOA attached to this ordinance.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No new expenditures will be obligated by this ordinance. ($0.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to accept a twelve-month No-Cost Extension from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the CDC Health Disparities Grant for a new grant period of June 01, 2021 to February 28, 2025; to modify existing contracts with Wa Fi LLC dba PLANIT Studios and Quality Custom Signs LLC; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to accept a twelve-month No-Cost Extension from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the CDC Health Disparities Grant for a new grant period of June 01, 2021 to February 28, 2025; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to modify the existing contracts with Wa Fi LLC dba PLANIT Studios and Quality Custom Signs by extending their contract terms from an end date of February 29, 2024 to a new end date of May 31, 2024; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual, daily operations of the Department of Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to accept this twelve-month NCE and to modify these contracts to ensure implementation of the NCE and completion of the Wayfinding Project prior to the end of the original grant and contract period of February 29, 2024 and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is authorized and directed to accept a twelve-month No-Cost Extension from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the CDC Health Disparities Grant for a new grant period of June 01, 2021 to February 28, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Board of Health is authorized to modify the existing contracts with Wa Fi LLC dba PLANIT Studios and Quality Custom Signs LLC by extending their contract terms from an end date of February 29, 2024 to a new end date of May 31, 2024.\n \nSECTION 3.  That these contract modifications are in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these contract modifications are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the city's financial records.\nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part thereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
