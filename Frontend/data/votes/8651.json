    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify the existing contract with LifeCare Alliance for the provision of food bank and home delivered meals for eligible Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipients for the period of August 1, 2023 through February 28, 2024 in an amount not to exceed $53,266.00 for a new total contract amount of $101,266.00.\n \nThroughout the fiscal year, Columbus Public Health monitors spending by all Ryan White Part A (RWPA) providers and makes necessary adjustments for service reallocation, per grant service category to service clients in Central Ohio (Franklin, Licking, Delaware, Morrow, Union, Madison, Pickaway, and Fairfield counties). These said services are measured by need in the community, thus causing a need to modify this contract with LifeCare Alliance. Any services or goods provided in conjunction with this contract modification are based on an average monthly cost rate per client. LifeCare Alliance is a not for profit agency and is exempt from bidding according to bidding requirements of the City Code 329.30. \n LifeCare Alliance CC-006078: $53,266.00\n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that health disparities within the Columbus, Ohio TGA region continue to be addressed for eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS. Emergency action will ensure timely payment to providers and for LifeCare Alliance to be able to continue medical case management services to the community. This modification will allow more Ryan White Part A initiatives to be delivered and will assist in meeting deliverables required by grantor and reduce risk of forfeiture of future grant funds.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nThis contract is fully funded by the Ryan White Part A grant program and does not generate any revenue or require a city match.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with LifeCare Alliance for the Ryan White Part A HIV Care Grant Program, for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio for the period of August 1, 2023 through February 28, 2024, to authorize the expenditure of $53,266.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($53,266.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need to modify an existing contract with LifeCare Alliance for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio and to expand food bank and home delivered meals for eligible Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipients for the period of August 1, 2023 through February 28, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, LifeCare Alliance has the expertise necessary to provide these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to modify a contract with LifeCare Alliance in order to ensure continuity of services for Ryan White Part A HIV Care clients, to increase the number of Ryan White Part A initiatives to be delivered, and to assist in meeting deliverables required by the grantor and reduce risk of forfeiture of future grant funds, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into a contract modification with LifeCare Alliance, for a total contract amount not to exceed $101,266.00, for HIV-related services to persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio, for the period of August 1, 2023 through February 28, 2024\n \nSECTION 2.                     That to pay the cost of said contract, the expenditure of $53,266.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized from the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, object class 03 per the attached accounting document. \n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the city's financial records.\n \nSECTION 5.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
