    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into contract with Ohio State University for the creation of Immigrant Refugee, and Migrant Town Halls. Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting October 1, 2023.\n \nImmigrants and refugees are vibrant and vital to the City of Columbus. In 2019, they contributed $353 million dollars to state and local taxes. Immigrants contribute to the economic development of this city and we have long seen an impact in our historic neighborhoods like German Village, Italian Village, and Hungarian Village. As thousands have resettled and continue to resettle here, they often face barriers or are unable to access resources. These town halls will speak directly with immigrants, refugees, and migrants in Columbus to delve deep into the issues these communities face, and the ways the City can ensure that all residents can access the city in a comfortable way.\n \nThe City of Columbus utilized a Request for Proposals (RFP) process to identify and assess Facilitators to conduct moderated focus groups and listening sessions to hear from immigrants, refugees, and migrants with the goal of creating a plan for an inclusive City of Columbus. Proposals were submitted in response to RFP021968 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, and Ohio State University received the highest overall score from the RFP committee for the role of facilitator.\n \nThese town halls will:\n•                     Provide outreach to immigrant, refugee, and migrant populations in Columbus so that they are engaged and informed of the process;\n•                     Collect the ideas and opinions of immigrants, refugees, and migrants in Columbus about policies resources, and other areas affecting their integration and sense of belonging;\n•                     Articulate themes and priorities from the listening sessions to inform the City;\n•                     Create a report that provides recommendations and concrete action steps for the City and Community Stakeholders.\n \nOrdinance 2187-2022 authorized the City Clerk to enter into contract with Ohio State University for the creation of Immigrant Refugee, and Migrant Town Halls. That contract expired before the work of creating the town halls was finished. This ordinance will allow for that work to be completed.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any delay in finishing the work of creating Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Town Halls.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a contract with Ohio State University for the creation of Immigrant Refugee, and Migrant Town Halls; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenditures incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order; and to declare an emergency. ($21,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, ten percent of the city’s residents are foreign born and this number is only expected to rise; and\n \nWHEREAS, immigrants and refugees are vibrant and vital to the City of Columbus and in 2019, they contributed $353 million dollars to state and local taxes; and\n \nWHEREAS, as communities of immigrants, refugees, and migrants continue to spur growth in the cultural richness, economic growth, and development of Columbus, these town halls will ensure that their needs are addressed in an impactful way and that Columbus continues to make space for all residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into contract with Ohio State University, in order to create Immigrant Refugee, and Migrant Town Halls, and to allow for the work of Ohio State University to continue uninterrupted, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
