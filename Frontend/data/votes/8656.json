BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify contracts with Ohio Machinery dba Ohio Peterbilt, in order to pay surcharges passed along from the suppliers, and with proper documentation. \n \nThe Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Division, has placed orders with several vendors for different types of equipment over the past three years, however due to the long lead times for production and delivery in the post-pandemic market place, many surcharges are being assessed by the manufactures and their suppliers. \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to modify the existing contracts to add the surcharges of up to $257,000.00 for the trucks. The Department of Public Service feels these changes are acceptable considering the supply chain issues and increased material costs therein, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the vehicles offered by the contracted vendor will meet the needs of the Department of Public Service, and maintain the replacement of aged vehicles in the Division of Refuse Collection’s fleet.   The following vehicles we're assessed surcharges:\n \nPO295247 - Two (2) Peterbilt/Heil 42-Yard Front Loading Trucks:       Original Cost $355,220.00 + Surcharge $55,883.00 = $411,103.00: Subtotal = $111,766.00\n                            Two (2) Peterbilt/Heil 32-Yard Rear Loading Trucks:       Original Cost $306,137.00 + Surcharge $51,499.00 = $357,636.00: Subtotal = $102,998.00\nPO395724 - Two (2) Peterbilt/Lightning Loader Knuckelboom Trucks: Original Cost $216,600.00 + Surcharge $21,118.00 = $237,718.00: Subtotal = $42,236.00\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Total = $257,000.00\n \nThe following Purchase Agreement association requires approval by City Council in order for the Division to expend more than $100,000.00 in a fiscal year per City Code Section 329.19(g):\n \nOhio Machinery Company dba Ohio Peterbilt: Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement, PA006315, Ordinance 3516-2022, for Knuckle Boom Waste Trucks.\n \nOhio Machinery Company dba Ohio Peterbilt: Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement, PA005654, Ordinance 2623-2020, for Front and Rear Loading Waste Trucks.\n \nOhio Machinery Company dba Ohio Peterbilt is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for the vendor:\nOhio Machinery dba Ohio Peterbilt is CC006428 and expires 6/8/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are budgeted and available for this expenditure from the Division of Refuse Collection Bond Fund 7703.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThese expenditures are being made from Universal Term Contracts established for use by the City’s Purchasing Office and as such do not require MWBE goals to be established.\n \n5.
