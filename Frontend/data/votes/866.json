    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a sanitary sewer easement described and recorded in Instrument Number, 201803280040299 Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”). The Easement burdens real property located in the vicinity of Cannon Drive and West 12th Avenue {Franklin County Tax Parcel 010-067007} (“Servient Estate”) currently owned by the State of Ohio. The City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”) has reviewed the request by the property owner to vacate a 0.072 acre portion of the existing easement and determined that the sewer will be relocated and the easement is no longer needed. DPU has determined that terminating a portion of the City’s rights to the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable. \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release and terminate a portion of the City’s easement rights described and recorded in Instrument Number 201803280040299, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
