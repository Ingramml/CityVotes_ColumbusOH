    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Intersection Improvements - Safety Study General Engineering 2018.\nOrdinance 3208-2018 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Intersection Improvements - Safety Study General Engineering 2018 project. The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources to develop Safety Studies, School Circulation Studies/Analysis/Plans, and perform Traffic Engineering, Roadway Engineering, Survey/Data Collection, and other safety studies work as needed. \n \nOrdinance 0817-2021 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $300,000.00 to expand the capacity to perform various traffic studies in an anticipated need to support the Vision Zero action plan adopted by City Council on March 8, 2021.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $100,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $100,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $300,000.00                     (PO152686, Ord. 3208-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $300,000.00                     (PO269902, Ord. 0817-2021)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                                    $100,000.00                     (This ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                          $700,000.00 \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to expand the Department’s capacity to perform various traffic studies.  With Vision Zero being implemented, it’s anticipated that more studies will need to be performed.  Existing staff levels and consultant contract levels are not enough to support the effort.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThis modification will allow work to proceed on tasks already in progress.  Modifying the contract will result in the best end product.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nCost was determined based on the typical cost of safety studies and applications for federal grants previously prepared as well as an estimate of the amount of tasks outstanding.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Burgess & Niple, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Burgess & Niple, Inc. is CC004425 and expires 1/10/2026.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $100,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of cash and appropriation is necessary to align spending with the proper project. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure funding is available to continue work on federal grant applications so the deadline for applications is met to avoid unnecessary delays for upcoming projects.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Burgess & Niple in connection with the Intersection Improvements - Safety Study General Engineering 2018 project; to authorize the expenditure of $100,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
