    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Builderscape, Inc. for the Alkire Road Park Development Project. The contract amount is $1,401,813.00, with alternates of $6,000.00 and a contingency of $100,000.00, for a total of $1,507,813.00. An additional $2,000.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for a total of $1,509,813.00 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nIn 2007, Recreation and Parks acquired 110 acres of former farmland on the city’s west side, near the Village of Galloway. The property is located within the Big Darby Tier One Environmental Preservation areas and is considered a key preservation site on the boundary of Columbus and the Big Darby Watershed. As part of the acquisition, 25 acres of land was set aside for a future neighborhood park for Columbus residents in the Laurel Greene and Southwest Airport neighborhoods. \n \nUpon completion, the park will feature a 7,900 square foot playground, a rustic timber open-air shelter, and an asphalt path connecting to the Camp Chase Trail and neighboring developments. The park will also include a meandering natural surface walking loop, open green spaces, strategically placed benches, and a well-designed park drive leading to a modest parking lot. The thoughtful design of the park aims to not only provide recreational amenities. It will also aim to showcase and protect the inherent beauty of the existing bluestem meadow, forested areas, and wetlands. These improvements will elevate the overall user experience.\n \nConstruction is scheduled to start in the spring of 2024 and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 2024. This initiative not only reflects the Recreation and Parks Department’s commitment to community well-being but also emphasizes sustainable development practices in creating a harmonious balance between recreation and environmental preservation.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on November 13, 2023 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on December 19, 2023.
