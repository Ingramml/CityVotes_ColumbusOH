The streets include Riverview Drive, Harley Drive, West Pacemont Road, Indianola Avenue, East Kenworth Road, Karl Road Cul-de-sac, Norwood Street, Huy Road, and Brentnell Boulevard.\n \nThe Community Planning Areas are “38 - Olentangy West”, “39 - Clintonville”, “40 - North Linden”, and “41 - Northeast”.  \n \nTIMELINE:  All work shall be complete within 430 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed in March 2024.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  \nThe bid amount and proposed award amount is $4,258,217.43 including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract
