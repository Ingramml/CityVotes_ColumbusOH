    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), to renew a contract with SHI International Corporation (a.k.a., SHI) for the purchase of Cloudflare Core Services, in the amount of $55,523.43, for the coverage term period from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025. Cloudflare is the Department of Technology’s external DNS provider and provider of custom certificates. In addition this purchase will also provide protection for the denial of service attacks and mitigation, and web application firewall services. Cloudflare has provided the City of Columbus robust DNS management as well as DNS security. The original contract was authorized and established via Ord. No. 1084-2022 (RFQ020895), passed on May 2, 2022 through Purchase Order PO333925 for Cloudflare Core Services. The term of this contract will be for one (1) year, from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025. This contract is not subject to automatic renewal, however upon mutual agreement and authorized appropriation the contract can be renewed for one (1) more additional one-year term. This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $55,523.43 for the purchase of the above-described Cloudflare Core Services. \nFISCAL IMPACT\nLast year (2023) the Department of Technology expended $51,612.90 with SHI International Corporation for Cloudflare Core Services. This year (2024), funds for the above-mentioned Cloudflare Core Services in the amount of $55,523.43 are available and budgeted in the 2024 Information Services Operating Budget, as noted in the attachment to this ordinance. Including this renewal, the aggregate total contract amount is $161,068.91. This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 City of Columbus Operating Budget, Ordinance 3012-2023\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to ensure prompt purchase order execution so that these critical services are in place as soon as possible. Cloudflare Core Services are the Department of Technology’s external DNS provider and provider of custom certificates and also provide protection for the denial of service attacks and mitigation, and web application firewall services. Without the passage of this ordinance the City would be vulnerable to potential security threats/issues as Cloudflare provides the City of Columbus robust DNS management as well as DNS security. \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: SHI International Corporation                     EBO_CC#001671                     Expiration Date: 5/5/2024\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to renew a contract with SHI International Corp. for the purchase of Cloudflare Core Services; to authorize the expenditure of $55,523.43 from the Information Services Operating Fund for the above-described purpose; and to declare an emergency.
