    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nOn March 2, 2015, a request for proposal SA005789 for city-wide e-payments services was issued by the Columbus City Treasurer's Office.  One hundred thirty-nine vendors were contacted electronically.  Proposals were received from three (3) bidders and subsequently reviewed by the Columbus Depository Commission, which recommended, subject to the approval of City Council, the award of e-payment services on January 25, 2016, to First Data Government Solutions, LP.  The contract is for a period of ten (10) years, beginning March 2, 2016, through March 1, 2026, subject to annual appropriations and approval of contracts by the Columbus City Council.\n \nThe contract for e-payment services has successfully brought online payments to many city divisions.  At the present time, the following city divisions are using the services provided by this contract: City Auditor (Income Tax), Public Safety (License, Fire and Weights and Measures), Building and Zoning, Human Resources (Training), Health, Recreation and Parks, Public Service, and Public Utilities. \n \nPricing for the ten-year contract was established at the time the bid was awarded.  Increases in funding are determined by each agency based on their usage of services (volumes).\nThe contract for the first year of e-payment services was authorized by Columbus City Council with passage of ordinance 0301-2016 on February 22, 2016.\n \nColumbus City Council authorized the renewal of the City Treasurer’s Office contract with First Data for the eighth year of e-payment services for the period March 2, 2023, through March 1, 2024, with passage of ordinance 0387-2023 on February 13, 2023.\n \nAt this time, the City Treasurer’s Office wishes to renew its contract with First Data for the ninth year of e-payment services for the period March 2, 2024, through March 1, 2025.  The City Treasurer’s Office will begin the process of transitioning gateway services to another banking partner this year, the result of a banking RFP.  Despite the forthcoming transition, time is needed to make the change.  The renewal of the e-payment contract with First Data will assure that services to the public will continue.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that there is no interruption in credit card payment services available to the customers of the city.\nFISCAL IMPACT:\nFunds for these expenditures are contingent on passage of the 2024 budget, Ordinance 3011-2023.\n \nContract Compliance:  First Data Government Solutions 582582959 expiration 11/16/2025.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to renew its contract for city-wide e-payment services with First Data Government Solutions, LP; to authorize the expenditure of up to $78,000.00 from various funds within the city; and to declare an emergency.
