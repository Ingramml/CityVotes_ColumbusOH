    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to accept and appropriate $480,000.00 in funds from the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health (ADAMH) Board of Franklin County for the Public Health/Police Mobile Crisis Response Program for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 and to purchase six unmarked police cars and all necessary accessories to be used by the City of Columbus’ Mobile Crisis Response Teams (MCR) in an amount not to exceed $500,000.00, an amount that includes $20,000.00 to be provided by Fleet Management as authorized in Ordinance 0213-2023 and budgeted within ACPR002748. \n \nMCR Teams consist of specially trained Columbus Police Officers and Columbus Public Health Clinicians that respond to individuals in behavioral health and/or substance abuse crisis to provide assistance through de-escalation and linkage to resources. The MCR unit ensures the dignity of all people and strives for collaboration while improving outcomes for the community, reducing demands on police resources and improving safety for the officers, consumers and the community. \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for the purchase of the aforementioned vehicles and all necessary accessories utilizing the funds awarded to Columbus Public Health. The purchase orders will be issued from Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) that have been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office, including but not limited to George Byers Sons Inc for the acquisition of automobiles by the Fleet Management Division, Law and Order Technology LLC for the purchase of computers and accessories, Parr Public Safety Equipment Inc for the associated purchase of police vehicle up-fitting, and Motorola Solutions Inc for the purchase of radio equipment. In addition, this ordinance also authorizes the purchase of other related up-fitting which will be procured via the competitive bid process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n  \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders from Ohio Department of Administrative Services (DAS) contracts, after approval of the Purchasing Office, for related up-fitting. Ordinance #582-87 authorizes City agencies to participate in DAS cooperative contracts.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for additional up-fitting needs in accordance with the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 for up-fitting services not otherwise covered via the Parr Public Safety UTC or Ohio Department of Administrative Services contracts.\n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract as per the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicle order windows to open and close, at random, with little to no notice. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that orders can be placed as soon as possible.\nFiscal Impact: The Public Health/Police Mobile Crisis Response Program is fully funded by the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Board of Franklin County. Expenditures for authorized purchases are budgeted in the Health Departments Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and ACPR002748. ($500,000.00)\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept funds from the Alcohol, Drug and Mental Health Board of Franklin County and any additional funds for the Public Health/Police Mobile Crisis Response Program; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of funds from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund and ACPR002748; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the Public Health/Police Mobile Crisis Response Program; to authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division and Columbus Public Health, to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles and all necessary accessories for use by the Department of Public Safety and Columbus Public Health with George Byers Sons Inc, Parr Public Safety Equipment Inc, Law and Order Technology LLC, and Motorola Solutions Inc; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders from DAS cooperative contracts for the purchase of related vehicle up-fitting;  to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for additional vehicle up-fitting needs which will be purchased in accordance with the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency.
