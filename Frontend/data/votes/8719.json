The Department is returning to Council for approval to establish a grant agreement in the amount of the remaining balance of the original agreement.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately provide resources necessary to sustain human services programming within vulnerable Columbus communities.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available in the Division of Administration’s 2024 General Fund budget, this ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3011-2023.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to immediately provide resources necessary to sustain human services programming within vulnerable Columbus communities.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 004307 and expires 3/3/2024.  Arrangements are in process with the vendor to update the expiration date prior to the current end date.   \n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Huckleberry House, Inc. in support of human services programs; to authorize the reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order; to authorize the expenditure of $48,556.02 from the 2024 General Fund budget; and to declare an emergency.
