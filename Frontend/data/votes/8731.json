    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with CTL Engineering Inc., for construction administration/inspection services as part of the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract.  \n \nCTL Engineering Inc. was awarded a contract to perform construction administration/inspection services for Department of Public Utilities Capital Improvement Projects that bid during the years 2023, 2024, and 2025.  The contract is modified as needed throughout the three-year contract period to include these projects as they go to construction.  The construction project to be administered by CTL Engineering Inc. under this contract modification is the Riverview Drive Avenue Area Water Line Improvements, CIP No. 690236-100125, in the amount of $560,070.32.\n \nThis work will primarily be performed in Columbus Community Areas 38-Olentangy West; 39-Clintonville; 40-North Linden; and 41-Northeast.  The Columbus Community Area used in the accounting template for this project will be 99-Citywide as the work spans multiple Community Areas.\n \n1.1. Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $560,070.32\nOriginal Contract:       $673,163.42 (ORD 0849-2023; PO391468)\nModification #1:       $1,733,433.48 (ORD 2061-2023; PO405348, PO405351)\nModification #2:           $60,000.00 (ORD 2722-2023: PO416229)\nModification #3:         $560,070.32 (current)                     \n                            Total    $3,026,667.22\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 0849-2023.  \n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between CTL Engineering, Inc. and the Division of Water based upon the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency and valves that are inoperable.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss. The Neighborhood Liaison(s) will be contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nCTL Engineering Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004209 and expires 7/31/2024.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  CTL Engineering, Inc. is ODI certified as an MBE company.  As shown in the Utilization Plan attached to this ordinance, CTL Engineering, Inc. plans to use one sub-consultant on this task.  The MBE spend for this contract is anticipated to be 94.4%.  The subcontractor CTL Engineering, Inc. proposes to use for this contract modification is listed below:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nE. P. Ferris & Associates, Inc.                    Columbus, OH                                                                               MAJ\n \nCTL Engineering Inc.’s and E. P. Ferris & Associates, Inc.’s certifications were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0997-2023, passed by Council on 4/24/23.  CIP # 690236-100125 is not listed as a project anticipated to be funded through this loan program in Ordinance 0997-2023.  Section 2 of the Ordinance allows the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to add projects to the list per departmental need.  \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  A purchase order will need to be established to CTL Engineering Inc. for this contract modification.  Public Utilities will need to pay the construction administration and inspection charges directly to CTL Engineering Inc. and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nA transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, in the amount of $560,070.32 is needed to fund this contract modification.  The transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in February, 2024.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new Fund. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to execute this contract modification as soon as possible as construction services are needed to be in place when the construction contract for this project is ready to execute, which is on City Council’s 2/12/24 agenda as 30-day legislation, to prevent the City from being liable for delay charges for issuing a late Notice to Proceed or for causing the contractor to be unable to meet the project completion date. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with CTL Engineering Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract;
