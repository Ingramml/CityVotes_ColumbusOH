    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into contract with the Greater Columbus Arts Council (GCAC) for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds to provide funding for grants to artists and arts organizations that serve as the foundation for the city’s profile as a vibrant, inclusive city. These proceeds will be distributed from the Creation, Innovation and Inclusion Fund, which was established pursuant to Ord. 3378-2018.   \n \nThe Creation, Innovation and Inclusion fund greatly increases the number of grants available to artists, events and nonprofits, thus enabling them to explore their creativity. Funds will be used by the Greater Columbus Arts Council to distribute grants to artists, and nonprofits contributing to the city’s creative culture and opening the doors of arts and culture for all residents. Funds will also be utilized to empower emerging artists and to further advance arts education within Columbus neighborhoods through programming at arts organizations. These funds will be disbursed through existing Greater Columbus Arts Council grant programs, including the following areas: operating support, project support, individual artist grants, and artist fellowships. Furthermore, these funds will provide support and resources through an international artist exchange, residency programs and workshops as well as any new programs designed for arts non-profits led by and primarily serving people of color.  \n \nAs previously stated, City Council has established the Creation, Innovation and Inclusion fund pursuant to Ord 3378-2018. This fund will be supported by an Admissions Tax on entrance to events within the city. It is estimated that this tax will generate $12,140,000.00 per current year in resources. It should be noted that beginning in 2020, the Greater Columbus Arts Council will fund the operations of the Greater Columbus Film Commission and Columbus Music Commission from proceeds it receives from the Creation, Innovation and Inclusion fund.\n \nGreater Columbus Arts Council invests in cultural arts and sports venues to provide cultural experiences for the City of Columbus. The services provided cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide. \n \nEmergency action is requested so that 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds can be disbursed without delay to ensure timely payments to the GCAC to provide funding for the grants.\n \nFiscal Impact: This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with the Greater Columbus Arts Council for the purpose of distributing the 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds from the Creation, Innovation and Inclusion Fund to empower emerging artists and to further advance arts education within Columbus neighborhoods. The Greater Columbus Arts Council will receive revenue from admission taxes generated from events held at venues other than Nationwide Arena, estimated at an annual amount of $12,140,000.00.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into contract with the Greater Columbus Arts Council, Inc. for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds to provide funding for grants to artists and arts organizations that serve as the foundation for the city’s profile as a vibrant, inclusive city; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of proceeds from the Creation, Innovation and Inclusion Fund anticipated to be $12,140,000.00; and to declare an emergency.
