    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into contract with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority (FCCFA) for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds from the Facility Stabilization Fund for the purpose of infrastructure investment in Nationwide Arena. \n \nNationwide Arena is home to the Columbus Blue Jackets and attracts national events, conventions, conferences and performances. The Arena is a cornerstone for Columbus economic development and directly and indirectly supports thousands of jobs in the city. As Columbus grows, and as the city earns an increasingly elevated status as a destination for concerts, conventions, and other major events, the demands upon the Arena will increase as well. Since the Arena is a publicly-owned facility, there is an inherent responsibility to plan for and support the costs of long-term maintenance and repairs.\n \nAs such, Columbus City Council authorized the establishment of the Facility Stabilization Fund, pursuant to Ord. 3379-2018.  This Fund was created in order to provide for the resources necessary to maintain this integral facility. Proceeds were made possible via the enactment of a 5% tax on admissions to events occurring at Nationwide Arena. This tax is estimated to yield approximately $4,065,000.00 per year in revenue. Of that revenue, 80%, or an estimated $3,250,000.00, will be contracted with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority for long-term capital improvements and building infrastructure at Nationwide Arena.  \n \nNationwide Arena is a public owned facility and support for this facility includes long term maintenance and repairs. The services provided cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds can be disbursed without delay to ensure timely payments so that necessary infrastructure investments can continue in Nationwide Arena without interruption.\n \nFiscal Impact: This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds from the Facility Stabilization Fund for the purpose of infrastructure investment in Nationwide Arena.  Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority will receive 80% of the estimated annual revenue ($3,250,000.00).\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into contract with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority (FCCFA) for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds from the Facility Stabilization Fund for the purpose of infrastructure investment in Nationwide Arena; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of an estimated $3,250,000.00 from the Facility Stabilization Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($3,250,000.00). \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3379-2018 was passed on December 10, 2018, enacting Chapter 376 of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance 3379-2018 authorized the creation of the Facility Stabilization Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, the revenue generated by the creation of this fund provides necessary maintenance  and long-term capital improvements for Nationwide Arena, a cornerstone for Columbus economic development that directly or indirectly supports thousands of jobs; and \n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it has become immediately necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to enter into contract with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds from the Facility Stabilization Fund, so that necessary infrastructure investment in Nationwide Arena can continue without interruption, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department Finance and Management is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority for the purpose of distributing 2024 Admissions Tax proceeds from the Facility Stabilization Fund for the purpose of infrastructure investment in Nationwide Arena.\n \nSECTION 2.
