($328,218.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into and, if needed, modify contracts with the following vendors: Aids Healthcare Foundation, Equitas Health, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Central Outreach Wellness Center, and The Ohio State University to provide Ending the HIV Epidemic related services, referenced in Ordinance 0441-2024. \n \nThese services execute and promote medical and support services to any persons living with HIV. Key strategies of Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program are: Diagnose, Treat, Prevent, and Respond and have allowable service categories as defined by the Health Resources and Services Administration HIV/AIDS Bureau. The purpose of the grant program is to focus resources in jurisdictions with substantial HIV burden to implement strategies, interventions, approaches, core medical and support services to reduce new HIV infections in the United States. The overarching goal for this initiative is to reduce new HIV infections in the United States to less than 3,000 per year by 2030. \n \nTo assist in implementing the key grant initiatives, contracts will be executed with qualified vendors. The term of the contract with each qualified vendor is March 1, 2024, through February 28, 2025, with funding based on vendor estimates of annual funding requirements for allowable services. These services encompassing Ryan White Part A and Ending the HIV Epidemic were advertised through vendor services with RFQ023101 on October 10, 2022, according to bidding requirements of the City Code. This RFQ covers a 60-month grant period, March 1, 2023 to February 28, 2028 annual contracts will be issued. \n \nAIDS Healthcare Foundation CC-010938: $74,186.50\nEquitas Health CC-004721: $130,441.00\nThe Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital CC-006172: $21,507.25\nCentral Outreach Wellness Center CC-043135:$50,000.00\nThe Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center CC-006163: $52,083.25\n \nTOTAL CONTRACTS:  $328,218.00\n                                                          \nUnder the terms of the grant, funds must be used during the grant period or they are forfeited and CPH may be subject to penalties related to future grant funding.  Previously, CPH has reallocated unused funds from vendors through appropriate contract modifications. These modifications oftentimes required additional legislation. Most recently, toward the goals of minimizing unused funds, maximizing available services, and avoiding funding penalties, HRSA has tasked CPH with improving the process by which unused funds are reallocated. Therefore, this ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with qualified vendors, modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds by entering into contracts with newly identified and qualified vendors without the need for additional legislation. As such, this ordinance requests a waiver of the provisions of City Code Chapter 329. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to ensure that quality medical care continues to be available to eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS and to ensure timely payment to providers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Contracts entered into by Columbus Public Health with vendors who meet federal requirements related to services allowable under the Ending the HIV Epidemic Grant Program, as well as comply with the RFQ and City bidding processes are contingent upon acceptance and passage of Ordinance 0441-2024. This ordinance will authorize one ACPO in the amount of $328,218.00 to encumber funds using available grant appropriations for contracts with vendors.  \n \n  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into initial contracts with qualified vendors, modify those contracts if portions of previously appropriated and encumbered funds are unused, and reallocate unused funds by entering into contracts with newly identified and qualified vendors pursuant to federal requirements, for the Ending the HIV Epidemic Grant Program for the provision of services allowable under the grant for persons with HIV or AIDS in central Ohio; to authorize the expenditure of  $328,218.00 from the Health Department Grants Fund to pay the costs thereof; to waive applicable provisions of City Code 329; and to declare an emergency. ($328,218.00)  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the city receives funding totaling $714,800.00 for the the Ending the HIV Epidemic grant program (the Grant) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which requires Columbus Public Health (CPH) to assure quality medical care to eligible persons living with HIV or AIDS in Central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the Board of Health to enter into contracts for services; and,\n \n WHEREAS, $328,218.00 in additional funds are needed for the continued provision of allowable services under the Ending the HIV Epidemic Grant Program for a sum total of contracts not to exceed $328,218.00; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health will enter into initial contracts with AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Equitas Health, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Central Outreach Wellness Center and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, and who will provide various HIV-related services to meet all grant deliverables required by the Grant; and\n \nWHEREAS, HRSA has tasked CPH to improve the efficiency of the reallocation of grant funds as necessary to minimize unused funds, maximize available services, and avoid funding penalties; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the Board of Health to enter into and modify contracts with vendors that are identified by CPH as qualified to provide the required services and meet federal requirements for the Grant; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for the Board of Health to reallocate appropriated and encumbered unused funds by modifying existing contracts or entering into additional contracts with vendors that are newly identified by CPH as qualified to provide the required services that meet federal requirements for this grant funding without the need for additional legislation; and, \n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the city to waive provisions of City Code Chapter 329; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board to enter into contracts in order to continue to provide quality medical care to eligible persons living with HIV/AIDS, to achieve viral suppression for individuals living with HIV, and any other service allowable under the grant services without interruption, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
