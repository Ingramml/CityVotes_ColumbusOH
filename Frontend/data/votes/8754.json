    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   Since 1974, Columbus Public Health has provided primary health care services to the underserved through contracts with community-based health centers. Since 1998, Columbus Public Health has contracted with Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (CNHC), a not-for-profit organization, to provide primary health care services to medically indigent patients at various neighborhood health centers. In 2023 Columbus Public Health expanded services by contracting with additional local designated FQHC's. This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into contracts with the following vendors to provide primary health care and dental services at community-based health centers for a total amount of $4,299,110.00 for the period of January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. This ordinance complies with City Code 329.30 as all contracts are not-for-profit organizations. Negotiated rates were based on the percentage of population served in Franklin County in 2022.  The designated FQHC’s provide primary health services not provided at Columbus Public Health. \n \nColumbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. dba PrimaryOne Health: $3,268,537.02\nHeart of Ohio Family Health Centers: $360,322.75\nLower Lights Christian Health Center, Inc.: $326,858.05\nSoutheast, Inc.: $240,316.22\nThe Ohio State University College of Nursing: $66,066.56\nLutheran Social Services of Central Ohio: $37,009.40\n \nCommunity Health Centers (CHC) are successful, low-cost options for primary care access in a nation that spends $2 trillion a year on health care. Medical costs for CHC patients are 41% lower compared to patients seen elsewhere such as a hospital emergency room. As a result CHC’s save the health care system between $9.9 billion and $17.6 billion a year.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to not delay these needed services for the community.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: These contracts are budgeted in the Health Special Revenue Fund.  This ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 operating budget, ordinance 3012-2023.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to enter into contracts with the following vendors: Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. (dba PrimaryOne Health), Heart of Ohio  Family Health Centers, Lower Lights Christian Health Center, Inc., Southeast, Inc., The Ohio State University College of Nursing, and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio to provide primary health care and dental services at community-based health centers; to authorize the expenditure of $4,299,110.00 from the Health Special Revenue Fund; and to declare an emergency.

(dba PrimaryOne Health), Heart of Ohio  Family Health Centers, Lower Lights Christian Health Center, Inc., Southeast, Inc., The Ohio State University College of Nursing and Lutheran Social Services of Central Ohio for the management and operations of the community health centers; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Health Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to enter into contracts with various community health centers in order to avoid delays in client services, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and Now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
