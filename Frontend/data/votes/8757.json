    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: Our community’s awareness of trauma, and its effect on our society, our neighborhoods, and our residents has increased in recent years. Trauma informed practices have become best practices in public health, education, and government. The law enforcement community has also recognized the need for trauma informed practices to be part of the training curriculum, as so many of our police officers are the first responders and investigators of our societies traumatizing events.\n \nHistorically, police interview and interrogation training has been separate from trauma informed interviewing which was usually reserved for forensic interviews of child victims of abuse. As the field increasingly recognizes the effect trauma has on victims, witnesses, and suspects across all ages, the Columbus Division of Police recognizes the need to train our officers and detectives in a manner consistent with our awareness of the needs in our community.\n \nThe Columbus Division of Police requests approval to spend $128,205.00 for ninety-nine Columbus Division of Police detectives and officers to complete Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview, (FETI) training facilitated by Veracities Public Benefit Corporation. This training, which will be held at the Columbus Police Academy, is an unprecedented opportunity to train approximately 1/3 of our detectives simultaneously. Not only does it put the Division of Police on the forefront of the next generation of interviewing techniques, but it also represents the City’s commitment to the reimagining of public safety, by choosing to innovate in a way, and at a scale, that demonstrates the Division’s commitment to our residents.\n \nFETI is a science and practice-based interviewing methodology informed by the current research on the neurobiology of trauma and memory. FETI® provides interviewers with a framework to maximize the opportunities for information collection and accurately document the interview in a neutral, equitable, and fair manner.\n \nLaw Enforcement uses Certified FETI to increase the quantity and quality of the information that they are able to gather from victims, witnesses, and suspects. FETI maximize and enhance the opportunities for better information collection resulting in better overall investigations and outcomes. \n \nDetectives/officers will complete a 16 hour, online Introduction to FETI Methodology course followed by a 3-day, in-person FETI Practical Application session lead by a Certified FETI trainer. The practical application sessions will be hosted at the Columbus Police Academy.  The total cost of the training is $1,295.00 per registrant:  99 x $1,295 = $128,205.00\n \nBID INFORMATION: The Division of Police is seeking a Bid Waiver for this training as Veracities Public Benefit Corporation has trademark over Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview® methodology and is the only entity with legal rights to deliver the training content.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  CC 030971 Vendor is in processing of updating profile and will be contract compliant prior to execution of contract.\n \nThis company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested so that the Division of Police may obtain the services in March and April as this is the availability of the provider to complete this class for the Division.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $128,205.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, from the 2024 Police Continuing Education Fund and the Entrepreneurial Training Program Fund for the FETI training for Division of Police. Funds are available in both Funds' Budget for this purpose.  There is an additional need to appropriate $50,000.00 in the Entrepreneurial Training Program Funds to partially fund this project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Police, to enter into contract with Veracities Public Benefit Corporation for the training of officers in Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview methodology (FETI); to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize an expenditure of $128,205.00 from the Police Continual Educational Fund and Entrepreneurial Training Program Fund; to appropriate funds in the Entrepreneurial Training Program Fund; and to declare an emergency.
