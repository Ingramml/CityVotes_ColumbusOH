The goal of this project is designed to prevent sewer backups in single and two-family homes in Columbus due to surcharging in city sewers from heavy rain or sewer blockages by protecting the home up to the top of casting of the nearest upstream manhole with a Spears or pre-approved backwater valve, which allows use of plumbing fixtures above that elevation in the remainder of the home.  Only homes deemed eligible by the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage qualify for this project.  Under this project an eligible home with an interior perimeter foundation drain connection to the lateral is also eligible, at the owner’s option for the installation of a sump pump that will redirect the foundation drainage away from the sanitary lateral to the sump pump and then discharge that drainage away from the house.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids for the subject project in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to construction contracts.  Three (3) bids (3 MAJ) were received on May 31, 2017.  TFH-EB, Inc., dba The Waterworks was determined to be the lowest,

3 year term of the contract which was due to expire on December 12, 2020.  Modification #2 extended the contract through February 28, 2021 and added additional funding.  With the heavy rains of 2020
