BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify the professional engineering services agreement with Hatch Associates Consultants Inc. for the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP) Concrete Rehabilitation Project, Capital Improvements Project No. 690389-100000, to add $1,925,000.00 to continue funding engineering services during construction.\n \nThe goal of this project is to rehabilitate deteriorated concrete and related structural/mechanical items caused by natural deterioration (age), service conditions, and weather (freeze-thaw) conditions.  This planned modification provides funding for engineering services during construction for the phase 2 bid package, including but not limited to shop drawing review services, responding to RFIs, preparing RFP and reviewing subsequent proposals, attending construction progress meetings, periodic site visits, and preparation of record documents.\n \nWork performed to date by Hatch Associates Consultants under this contract includes:\n•Condition assessment and preliminary design\n•Detailed design for Phase 1\n•Engineering services during construction for Phase 1 of the project\n•Engineering services during construction for Phase 2 of the project\nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” since the HCWP serves multiple planning areas.\n \n1.1 Future Renewals/Modifications:  There are no planned renewals or modifications to this contract after this modification.  An unplanned modification may be required if unforeseen circumstances are encountered.\n \n1.2 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,925,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                     $   741,300.00                     (PO019838)\nRenewal No. 1:                     $1,920,600.00                     (PO133389)\nRenewal No. 2:                     $1,307,900.00                     (PO182088)\nRenewal No. 3:                     $1,602,000.00          (PO287293)\nModification No. 1 (current):                                    $1,925,000.00\nTotal (Orig. + Renewals)                     $7,496,800.00\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nEngineering services during construction were included in the original RFP advertisement for which the Division received proposals for this project and are already part of the existing contract.  This modification is not expanding upon the scope or adding work that was not including in the original contract.  The sole purpose of this modification is to add funding for the planned final phase of the project.   \n \n1.4. How cost of renewal was determined:\nHatch Associate Consultants Inc. and the City developed a scope of work for these services based on the previous work performed and estimated efforts for this next phase of work. Hatch then developed the estimated level of effort and a fee to perform the work based upon existing contract rates.  The scope and fee were reviewed by the City PM and Hatch refined these based on City’s comments.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will rehabilitate deteriorated concrete around the treatment basins at the Divisions’ largest water treatment plant to prevent further and more costly damage that could occur if rehabilitation was postponed and to extend the life of this asset.  This project is part of the City’s ongoing efforts to maintain a reliable supply of safe drinking water to its customers, which will result in sustainable economic growth well into the future.\n \nPublic informational meetings are not anticipated for this project. All proposed work is anticipated to occur within the boundaries of the Hap Cremean Water Plant.\n \n3.
