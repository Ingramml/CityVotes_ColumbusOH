    "description": "Title\n \nTo honor and recognize March 3rd-9th, 2024 as Women in Construction Week. \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the North Central Region of the National Association of Women in Construction was established in 1959 and has celebrated Women in Construction week since 1998 ; and\n \nWHEREAS, only about 10% of the construction workforce is female, according to a recent report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor. Despite construction being a traditionally male dominated field, women provide a much needed perspective and skill set to the field. ; and\n \nWHEREAS, programs such as the Building Futures program here in Columbus, which teaches individuals the skills they need to be successful in construction, has seen an increase in women interested in joining the workforce; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus has events such as Building Trades Apprenticeship Career Fair to promote women in the trades; the fair is an opportunity for women to learn about careers in the skilled construction trades, meet construction professionals who can answer questions, and learn how to apply for a career in the construction industry; and\n \nWHEREAS, despite being historically male-dominated, the construction sector must diversify and become more inclusive to flourish as the increase of women in construction reshapes the industry standard for success and advances gender equity; now, therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does recognize March 3rd-9th, 2024 as Women in Construction Week.",
