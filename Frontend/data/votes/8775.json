    "description": "Title \n \nTo Celebrate March 17, 2024 as St. Patrick’s Day in the City of Columbus, Ohio\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, for more than 100 years the Irish of Columbus have promoted and shared their culture and heritage; and\nWHEREAS, many of the strong men and women of earlier generations fled The Great Hunger in Ireland to come to a new life in Columbus; and\nWHEREAS, so many of our proud Irish ancestors faced economic, religious and social persecution with heads held high and shoulders squared; and\n \nWHEREAS, those same Irish survived and prospered and built the infrastructure of Columbus as well as large families that spread from old Irish Broadway out to the North, South, East and West ends of Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, we remember the contributions of those who came before us, those who stand with us and thank God for the good fortune to be Irish; and\n \nWHEREAS, our strength is in our people and our love and care for one another is reflected in our 2015 Irish American honorees; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Shamrock Club of Columbus and its President, Nancy Murphy, have led the Club forward in honoring and celebrating our Irish heritage and culture; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Shamrock Club was founded in 1936 and has grown to include more than 2,000 members and offers a wide variety of Irish cultural events and activities every week of the year; and\n \nWHEREAS, together, as Clann na nGael, One Family Irish, we recognize the contributions of the Irish community to the City of Columbus; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  \nThat this council does hereby celebrate March 17, 2024 as St. Patrick’s Day in the City of Columbus, Ohio.",
