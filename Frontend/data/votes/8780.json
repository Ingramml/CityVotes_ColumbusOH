The Department of Technology uses Trellix software to protect city computer systems against malicious software such as computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, and spyware.\nEarly in 2023, DoT solicited quotes via RFQ024687 for the purchase of Trellix Software Support. For purposes of evaluating and determining the lowest responsive bid, and in accordance with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual, a bid discount of 5% was applied to bids where the prime contractor is a minority or woman-owned business or a minority or woman-owned joint venture certified with the Office of Diversity and Inclusion in the relevant work classification. Four responses were received. The bid amounts after application of bid discount (applicable only to Brown Enterprise Solutions) were as follows:\nBrown Enterprise Solutions -                      $321,100.00\nAxelliant LLC -                                                                                     $334,400.00\nVprime -                                                                                                                              $342,960.00\nCDW-                                                                                                                                                   $344,000.00\nThe Department of Technology recommended that award be made to Brown Enterprise Solutions having submitted the lowest, responsive bid, after discount.
