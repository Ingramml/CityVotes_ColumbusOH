($30,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. formerly IBI Group Engineering Services (USA), Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Roadway Improvements - General Engineering 2018 project.\nOrdinance 2620-2018 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. for the Roadway Improvements - General Engineering 2018 project.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, with continuing, contractual access to additional resources that are necessary to perform various professional engineering, survey, and technical expertise for the department to complete its capital improvements commitments.\n \nOrdinance 2424-2023 authorized the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify contracts with IBI Group Engineering Services to allow the assignment of all past, present and future contracts from IBI Group Engineering Services to Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc.\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $30,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $30,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $600,000.00     (PO146160, Ord. 2620-2018)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $30,000.00       (This Ordinance)\n \nThe contract amount including all modifications:                            $630,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification was not anticipated in the original contract legislation as this is a General Engineering contract with unknown tasks at the time of the original contract legislation. The task initially developed the City of Columbus Open Roads Workspace to assist designers using Open Roads Design (ORD) software to meet the Columbus design standards developed in AutoCad. Updates are needed when the Ohio Department of Transportation updates its design pack and when the software company, Bentley, that is responsible for the creation of ORD updates the software. Additionally we need support from the consultant to resolve questions throughout the year. The modification will cover currently needed updates and service for 2024.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nArcadis created the City of Columbus ORD Workspace and are the most qualified team to upgrade as needed and provide ongoing implementation support to end users. The scope of work is a reasonable extension of their work on creating the original City of Columbus ORD Workspace.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nCost was determined based on the typical cost of software update and design previously undertaken and prepared as well as an estimate of the amount of tasks outstanding.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc.\n \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. is CC009409 and expires 2/22/25.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $30,000.00 is available within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of cash and appropriation is necessary to align funding with the proper project. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Interim Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Arcadis Engineering Services (USA), Inc. in connection with the Roadway Improvements - General Engineering 2018 project; and to authorize the expenditure of up to $30,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project.
