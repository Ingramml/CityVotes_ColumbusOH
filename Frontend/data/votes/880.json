In the assessment period covered by this legislation (November 1st, 2020 through April 30th, 2021), owners of 119 properties within Columbus were notified to abate weed and solid waste nuisances.  Those properties where violations were not abated were turned over to the Environmental Nuisance Weed and Solid Waste Program for compliance.  Abatement was completed using the services of private and/or City contractors.
