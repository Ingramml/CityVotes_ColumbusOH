($499,883.36)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with HNTB Ohio, Inc. for the Smart Lighting Design project for design of Phase 3 of the project, CIP #670878-100003, in an amount up to $499,883.36.\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Power, has initiated a smart street lighting project to convert existing HPS luminaires to LED and connect them to a central control system.  A contract for the Smart Lighting Design project was awarded to HNTB Ohio, Inc. through the City’s RFP process under CIP #670878-100002.  The Smart Lighting project is a multi-year project that will ultimately connect all street lights in the city to a central control system.  The initial stage of this contract funded design of Phase 2 of the Smart Lighting project and provided that future design stages could be added to the contract over the next three years.  This modification will add funding to design Phase 3 of the Smart Lighting project to include preparing the Smart Lighting Phase 3 construction plans and to fund engineering services during construction.\n \nThe Columbus Community Area is “99 - Citywide” as the work is occurring in multiple City areas (Hilltop, Near East, and Near South).\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $499,883.36\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                $676,000.00 (Ord. 0815-2022; PO330311)\nModification #1 (current):                                               $499,883.36  \nModification #2 (Future)                                       $500,000.00 (Estimate) \nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):                                              $1,675,883.36\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was previously awarded per the City’s RFP process.  This is a planned modification to add funding for the current phase of the project.  A procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared a quote based on current contract pricing, contract job titles, and allowable expenses to accomplish the scope of work for this next phase.  The City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed the quote, negotiated with the consultant, and approved the final quote.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nImplementing Smart Lighting will allow the Division to not only control the streetlights from a central operating system, it will also notify staff immediately when an outage occurs, which will improve response times to outages. Replacing old HPS fixtures with LED technology will generate savings in electric energy, reduce greenhouse gases and long-term maintenance.  Additionally, the replacement of aging HPS luminaires with new LED fixtures will provide greater light output and better color rendering.  This will help pedestrians and motorists better identify objects at night. This has many benefits including improving traffic and pedestrian safety, and providing residents a better sense of safety and security. This may also deter criminal activity, which would lessen the financial impact on city resources such as the Police and Fire departments.  \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nHNTB Ohio, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC008025 and expires 7/15/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against HNTB Ohio, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  HNTB Ohio, Inc. has proposed the use of two subconsultants for this contract modification, one of which is classified as an MBE by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  It is anticipated this modification will have 11.0% MBE participation.\n \nAs part of their proposal, HNTB Ohio, Inc. has proposed the following subconsultants to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                    City/State                                   ODI Certification Status \nEMH&T Inc.                                                                                                 Columbus, OH                                                                          MAJ\nNational Engineering Services, Inc.                                            Columbus, OH                                                                           MBE\n \nThe certification of HNTB Ohio, Inc. and the above listed companies were in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
