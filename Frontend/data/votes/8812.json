    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase contract #EL011028 with Ohio Power Company, dba American Electric Power (AEP), to provide funding for the payment of 2024 pole attachment rental fees for the Division of Power (DOP), in accordance with an existing agreement for the Joint Use of Poles (the “Agreement”) executed by the City and Columbus Southern Power, dba AEP. \n \nIn December 2008, it was determined that the joint use fees would no longer be deducted from AEP's right-of-way permit fees and that AEP would be allowed to bill DOP directly for its joint pole usage. Ordinance 1242-2010 stipulated that for annual rental fees going forward, a contract modification to provide the funds will be approved annually by ordinance of City Council. Additionally, the City consented to the assignment of the Agreement by Columbus Southern Power to Ohio Power Company through the passage of ORD #0317-2014 after the merger of AEP Ohio’s two operating companies, with Ohio Power Company the surviving entity.\n \nDOP and AEP both own and operate electric transmission and distribution system facilities throughout Franklin County. These facilities include certain poles that have attached equipment owned by the other party. The Agreement provides the terms, conditions, and rates for the joint use of these poles. Per the terms of the Agreement, an inventory of jointly used poles was conducted in 2012. The Agreement provides that, in the event a pole inventory discloses any attachments that were not previously authorized by the pole owner, the attaching party is to pay annual charges for the attachments for a period of five (5) years or the period from the date of the last inventory, whichever is less, plus interest, at the current Interest Rate. \n \nThe invoice from AEP for 2024 annual rental fees, reflecting 15,567 attachments on AEP poles less 2,837 AEP attachments on City-owned poles, totals $190,950.00. For annual rental fees going forward, the contract modification provides that funds will be approved annually by ordinance of City Council.  \n \nThis ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code pertaining to contract modifications.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #15 is ADD $190,950.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $2,716,119.57.\n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known at the time of the initial contract. \n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used: This modification is a continuation of the original contract for the payment of rental fees for the joint use of poles owned by AEP.\n4.   How cost was determined: The modification is based upon a set annual attachment rental fee charged for each pole attachment for 2024 - currently $15/attachment - and any arrearage charges for attachments added during 2023.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nOhio Power Company, dba American Electric Power (AEP) | D365 Vendor #006032 | Federal EIN on file | Expires 4/26/2025 \n \nAEP does not hold MBE/FBE status.\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \n$190,950.00 is budgeted and available for this purchase.\nThis ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 Operating Budget, Ordinance 3012-2023. \n \n$374,535.00 was spent in 2023\n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract for Joint Use of Poles with Ohio Power Company, dba American Electric Power, for the Division of Power; and to authorize the expenditure of $190,950.00 from the Electricity Operating Fund.
