    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification for services with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc. (hereafter referred to as EMH&T) on the Blacklick Creek Interceptor contract, CIP #650034-100006, to add to the contract scope to for design work needed for the Blacklick Creek Sanitary Interceptor Sewer - Shaft 1 Control Gate project, CIP #650034-100010.  This will be a zero dollar contract modification as enough funding remains on the existing contract to pay for the added design work.\n \nDesign Services for both the Blacklick Creek Sanitary Interceptor Sewer and the associated Air Quality Control Facility and have been completed.  Construction of the interceptor sewer was completed in 2019, and the air quality control facility has recently begun construction.  Given the rapidly developing areas within the Blacklick tributary area, and the proposed high water users that will generate additional significant sewage flows that could not have been anticipated when the original projects were designed, it was determined the design of a control gate to throttle flows during wet weather to prevent overflows in the downstream areas would need to be added to the sewer system.\n \nThe design work for the Blacklick Creek Sanitary Interceptor Sewer - Shaft 1 Control Gate project was bid through the City’s RFP process.  The project was advertised on the Vendor Services site and the Bonfire site from March 10, 2023, through April 7, 2023.  No proposals were received for the project.  EMH&T designed the Blacklick Creek Sanitary Interceptor Sewer and the associated Air Quality Control Facility, has an open contract for those projects as they are still providing services during construction, the contract has sufficient funding remaining to perform the design services needed for the new work, and EMH&T has knowledge of the design work completed to this point that other firms would not have.  For these reasons, it was decided it was better to modify the existing contract with EMH&T to perform the needed design services than it would be to rebid the project.\n \n The Community Planning Area is “58 - Far East”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $0.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                  $2,137,198.16 (Ord. 0663-2007 EL007221)\nModification #1 Amount:                                     $5,706,025.31 (EL013173)\nModification #2 Amount:                                     $1,714,133.90 (EL017423)\nModification #3 Amount:                                     $    553,841.01 (PO089635)\nModification #4 Amount:                                     $    756,649.13 (PO115132)\nModification #5 Amount:                                     $ 1,122,657.07 (PO139162)\nModification #6 Amount:                                     $              0.00  (Current)\nTotal (Orig. + Modifications):                              $11,990,504.58\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThese services were intended to be performed via separate contract, however, when proposals were solicited for this work none were received.  EMH&T performed the design work for the related projects, has an open contract for those projects as they are still providing services during construction, the contract has sufficient funding remaining to perform the design services needed for the new work, and EMH&T has knowledge of the design work completed to this point that other firms would not have.  For these reasons, it was decided it was better to modify the existing contract with EMH&T to perform the needed design services than it would be to rebid the project. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe existing contract has sufficient funds remaining to perform the additional work.  The cost of the additional work was determined using existing contract titles, hourly rates, and allowable expenses for the estimated number of hours needed to perform the work.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis project will allow for continued development in the Blacklick tributary area, which will generate additional customers and user fees.  This project will also prevent downstream overflows from occurring during wet weather events. \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nEMH&T’s contract compliance number is CC004214 and expires 11/8/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against EMH&T.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  EMH&T is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  EMH&T anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of two sub-consultants, one of which is a City certified MBE.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 2.55%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, EMH&T has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nCDM Smith                                               Columbus, Ohio                                      MAJ\nDLZ Ohio Inc.                                           Columbus, Ohio                                      MBE                     \n \nThe certification of EMH&T and the above companies were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe funding remaining on the already established purchase order for this contract is thought to be sufficient for these additional tasks.  No additional funding is needed at this time. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a modification of the Blacklick Creek Interceptor contract with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc. to expand the scope to include the design of a control gate to prevent overflows in the downstream areas during wet weather.
