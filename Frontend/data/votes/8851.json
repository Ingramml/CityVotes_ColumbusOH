    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT), on behalf of various city departments, to enter into contract to exercise the fourth renewal option of a contract with ConvergeOne, Inc. for maintenance and support services associated with the Genesys Interactive Voice Response (IVR) System. The cost to renew the contract for these services totals $192,402.54 and is for a one-year period, beginning on April 30, 2024, and ending on April 29, 2025. Contingency funds in the amount of $10,000.00 are included in the total cost of $202,402.54.\nVarious city agencies use the current IVR System, including 311, Public Utilities, Building and Zoning Services and Technology. On April 26, 2021, Ordinance 0724-2021 passed, authorizing a contract, via a waiver of competitive bids, with ConvergeOne to continue maintenance and support of the system. At that time, ConvergeOne submitted a five-year quote, to be renewed (with Council approval) on an annual basis. DoT requests that the aforementioned contract be renewed for a fourth year to ensure continuation of the noted services, which will allow the department sufficient time to bid out maintenance and support for the entire system. Bidding out the entire system is necessary because Genesys has a policy of not allowing multiple parties to support their IVR systems. Thus, until DoT can develop comprehensive specifications, the department requests that the contract with ConvergeOne be renewed and that the provisions of competitive bidding be waived in this instance. \nThe quote attached to this ordinance covers maintenance and support services for the entirety of the City’s existing IVR environment for a five-year period. Year one (1) was authorized via Ordinance 0724-2021 (noted above), year two (2) was authorized via Ordinance 0994-2022, and year three (3) was authorized via ordinance 0507-2023. This ordinance authorizes coverage for year four (4), as indicated on pages two (2) and three (3) of the attached quote. The total amount in the quote represents the five-year commitment, but please note the cost for the single year renewal. The contract was most recently authorized by authority of Ordinance 0507-2023, passed on March 13, 2023, through purchase order PO385178.\nThis ordinance also requests that sections of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, pertaining to competitive bidding, be waived.\nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $202,402.54 for the above-described purpose.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE NUMBER\nVendor Name: ConvergeOne, Inc.\nVendor Certification: EBO_CC007864                                          Expiration Date: March 28, 2024\nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this contract are budgeted and available in the 2024 Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Budget.
