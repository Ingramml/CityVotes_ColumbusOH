    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a contract with Vertiv Corporation for maintenance and related services on the City’s Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) Systems. The City entered into an agreement (EL006410) for UPS maintenance services, authorized by ordinance 1160-2006. Last year the agreement was continued by authority of ordinance 0580-2023, passed March 13, 2023, through purchase orders PO381291 and PO381299. Approval of this ordinance will provide UPS maintenance services for the period April 19, 2024, to April 18, 2025, at a total cost of $95,936.27. \nAlthough maintenance services for the UPS Systems are available from other suppliers, Vertiv Corporation is the only factory-authorized service provider for the UPS equipment used at the city’s data centers. Where alternate providers of UPS services are required to utilize Liebert technicians, Vertiv Corporation’s policy is to bill the end user directly and not the third-party service provider; nor does Vertiv Corporation support third-party organizations with technical back-up or guaranteed parts availability. Given the critical need for reliable UPS systems at the city’s data centers, it is in the city’s best interest to contract directly with Vertiv Corporation. As such, this ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the provisions of sole source procurement of the City of Columbus Code Chapter 329. \nThis ordinance will also authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a contract agreement with Vertiv Corporation for additional equipment; heating, cooling and ventilation (HVAC), Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS), generator maintenance and support services with a coverage term period of April 19, 2024, through April 18, 2025, in the amount of $80,408.48. Last year, the agreement was authorized under ordinance 0580-2023, passed March 13, 2023, through purchase orders PO381291 and PO381299.\nAs a result of various system and equipment failures/malfunctions at the City’s Data Center, the Department of Technology has selected one (1) comprehensive vendor with the expertise to manage all equipment under one (1) contract. Previously there were five (5) separate vendors/contractors performing routine maintenance and support services which were not cost effective or efficient. The HVAC, Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS), generators maintenance and support services are interconnected, and all support will not be performed/provided by one (1) vendor under one (1) streamlined contract, increasing efficiency. For the reasons stated, this ordinance requests to waive the competitive bidding provisions in accordance with section 329 of the Columbus City Code to enter into the contract for additional equipment; HVAC, Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS), generator maintenance and support services.\nAdditionally, this ordinance authorizes contingency funding in the amount of $60,000.00 for unforeseen circumstances, replacement parts and maintenance services and/or additional travel not covered in the maintenance contract agreements. \nThe total amount of funding being requested via this ordinance is $236,344.75. \nFISCAL IMPACT\nDuring fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the amounts of $199,128.38 and $214,041.61 were legislated respectively for maintenance support and related services for the Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) Systems, HVAC Systems and various other equipment contracts. Funding for the 2024-2025 UPS contract in the amount of $95,936.27, the 2024-2025 HVAC system and various other equipment contracts in the amount of $80,408.48, and additional funds in the amount of $60,000.00, for a grand total funding request of $236,344.75, which is budgeted and available within the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund.
