    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The City Attorney, on behalf of the Director of the Department of Human Resources seeks the authority to utilize the services of the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP for legal services.  Baker & Hostetler LLP has been selected to provide assistance because of its experience representing the City of Columbus in previous negotiations with all bargaining units. \n \nThis legislation authorizes the City Attorney, on behalf of the Director of the Department of Human Resources, to enter into contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP and further authorizes the expenditure of $50,000.00 to compensate the contractor for services rendered in conjunction with legal services. Ordinance 0440-2024 authorizes the Director of the Department of Human Resources to engage Baker & Hostetler LLP to provide professional consulting services in connection to collective bargaining negotiations and related activities. \n \nThe competitive bid process would not be conducive to ongoing and anticipated legal services, as this law firm brings a wealth of institutional knowledge and experience in ongoing labor relations issues with the City of Columbus.  Therefore, competitive bidding requirements are being waived as it would not be in the City’s best interests to have contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  The law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP continues to bring a wealth of institutional knowledge and experience in ongoing legal services with the City of Columbus.  \n \nThe City Attorney has determined it appropriate and does approve of the use of Baker & Hostetler LLP for the purposes described in this ordinance.\nFiscal Impact:  Funds totaling $50,000.00 are budgeted specifically for this contract in the Department of Human Resources 2024 employee benefits fund budget; the availability of funds is contingent on the passage of the 2024 Other Funds budget ordinance 3012-2023.\n \nBaker & Hostetler LLP's contract compliance number is 340082025.\n \nEmergency Action:  Emergency action is being requested to allow for continued representation by the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP in providing legal services as it relates to collective bargaining negotiations and related activities. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney, on behalf of the Director of the Department of Human Resources, to enter into contract with the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP for the provision of legal services; to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the employee benefits fund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)  \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus requires the legal services provided by Baker & Hostetler LLP; and \n \nWHEREAS, the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP has provided ongoing assistance to the City of Columbus in conjunction with legal services; and \n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to City Charter Sections 66 through 78 and Chapter 125 of the City Codes, the City Attorney has determined it appropriate and does approve of the use of Baker & Hostetler LLP for the purposes described in this ordinance; and \n WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the city to waive relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code relating to competitive bidding in this situation, due to the law firm’s institutional knowledge and experience in ongoing legal service; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Human Resources in that it is immediately necessary to enter into contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP in order to finalize collective bargaining negotiations and related activities as soon as possible and to ensure the Department is able to pay its outside legal service costs, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
