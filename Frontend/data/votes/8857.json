    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the Public Safety Department Director, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into contracts for preventative maintenance and to authorize the Director of the Finance and Management Department to issue a purchase order for the purchase of parts, accessories and supplies with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the maintenance and repair of Stryker Power Load Cots, Bariatric Cots, and LUCAS Devices for use in emergency medical service (EMS) operations, and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes.  In 2018-2019, the Division of Fire standardized on Stryker Power Load Cots for emergency medical services.  Stryker Power Load Cots are purchased on a continuing basis for installation in all new-build emergency medical squads, and Stryker consumable parts (pads, straps, batteries, etc.) are purchased at regular intervals due to the normal daily utilization of these cots.  The Division of Fire purchases these cots and supplies directly from Stryker versus a resale provider which allows the Division to secure the lowest pricing available.  As the Division of Fire has standardized on the Stryker Power Load Cot product, it is critical that the Division be able to maintain a stock of both this equipment and consumable supplies.  Stryker Sales Corporation LLC is the sole manufacturer, distributor and authorized service agent for the Stryker Power Load Cots.\n \nBid Waiver Justification:  The Division of Fire has the ability to purchase directly from Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for Stryker Power Load Cots, related consumable supplies, and preventative maintenance.  This eliminates any mark-up from distributors ensuring the lowest available price on Stryker products.\n \nContract Compliance:  Stryker Sales Corporation LLC (FID #38-2902424 / Vendor #030281)\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is requested as funds for the EMS services and cots are needed to keep supplies stocked at adequate levels to avoid potential supply chain issues which could hinder the Fire Division's EMS response abilities, and to establish a preventative maintenance agreement that ensures all EMS emergency response equipment is maintained and thus will operate at peak levels.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $104,028.65 from the Division of Fire's general fund operating budget to purchase ambulance cot consumable supplies, and to establish a preventative maintenance agreement; the Division of Fire spent approximately $129,028.65 for these maintenance contracts and supplies in 2023, 2022 and 2021. This ordinance is contingent upon passage of the 2024 General Fund Operating Budget (Ord. 3011-2023).\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a contract for the purchase of consumable supplies with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire to enter into preventative maintenance agreements with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $104,028.65 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($104,028.65)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, there is a need within the Division of Fire to enter into preventative maintenance agreements with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the maintenance and repair of Stryker Power Load Cots, Bariatric Cots and LUCAS Devices; and,\n \nWHEREAS, there is a need for the Division of Fire to purchase Stryker Power Load Cots and consumable supplies for use in daily emergency services and emergency medical services (EMS) from Stryker Sales Corporation; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code Chapter 329 to purchase said consumables directly from Stryker Sales Corporation LLC in order to receive the best possible pricing; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management, through the Purchasing Office, and to authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to enter into contracts with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the purchase of consumable supplies and preventative maintenance services, respectively; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Fire, Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management, and Director of Public Safety, to enter into contracts with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC for the purchase of Stryker Power Load Cots, along with consumable supplies, and a preventative maintenance agreement for said equipment, respectively, in order to maintain adequate levels of such supplies to avoid potential supply chain issues which could hinder the Fire Division's EMS response abilities, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, property, safety, and welfare of the public; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract for Stryker Power Load Cots and consumable supplies, as needed, with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC on behalf of the Division of Fire.  \n \nSECTION 2. That the Public Safety Department Director be and is hereby authorized to enter into contracts for preventative maintenance services for Stryker Power Load Cots, Bariatric Cots, and LUCAS Devices with Stryker Sales Corporation LLC on behalf of the Division of Fire.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.   \n \nSECTION 4.  That the expenditure of $104,028.65, or so much thereof as is necessary, is hereby authorized from the Division of Fire's General Operating Fund Budget, as per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 5. That this Council finds it to be in the best interests of the City to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code relating to Competitive bidding for this purchase.\n \nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 7. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
