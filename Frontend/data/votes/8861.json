    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This resolution declares the City of Columbus's support and approval for the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio's (SWACO) Solid Waste Management Plan Update (\"Plan Update\") for the period covering 2024 to 2038.  SWACO’s mission is to improve the community’s solid waste stream through effective waste reduction, recycling, and disposal.  SWACO’s jurisdiction includes Franklin County and political sub-divisions with over 50 percent of their population in Franklin County.  \n \nThe Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio EPA requires solid waste districts to develop and periodically revise a Solid Waste Management Plan (Plan) every five (5) years. The purpose of the Plan is to address state mandated goals and outline programs and initiatives to reduce reliance on landfilling, increase recycling and reuse, and minimize waste generation.  SWACO’s draft Plan covers a fifteen (15) year period beginning in 2024 and ending in 2038.     \n \nAs a significant user of SWACO’s landfill for disposal of waste generated and collected by the Refuse Collection Division, the City of Columbus must approve of SWACO’s solid waste management plan.  The plan must show how SWACO will meet the waste reduction and diversion goals established in Ohio’s state solid waste management plan (“State Plan”) and present a budget for implementing its Plan Update.  Furthermore, the Plan Update must contain the information and data prescribed in Ohio Revised Code (ORC) 3734.53 and Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Rule 3745-27-90. Ohio EPA prescribes the format that details the information that is required and the manner in which that information is presented.    \n \nSWACO accepted public comments on the draft Plan Update and proposed Rules from October 16, 2023 through November 16, 2023. SWACO held a public hearing to obtain oral comments regarding the draft Plan Update Thursday, November 16, 2023.  The SWACO Board of Trustees recently approved an amended draft Solid Waste Management Plan Update on December 12, 2023.   \n \nSWACO has to receive community support and adoption of the draft Plan Update from the 41 communities in the Solid Waste District.  Therefore, SWACO is seeking approval from Columbus City Council on the district Plan Update.  Without approval from the City of Columbus, this plan cannot be submitted to the Ohio EPA for final approval.  SWACO must receive acceptance of the plan from legislative authorities representing a combined population of at least sixty percent (60%) of the Solid Waste Management District total population. \n \nTitle\n \nTo approve the Solid Waste Management Plan Update for the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (SWACO) as a guide for the management of solid waste and waste reduction activities.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is located within the jurisdiction of the Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio (hereinafter “SWACO” or “Authority”).\n \nWHEREAS, the SWACO Board of Trustees prepared and adopted a final draft of the Solid Waste Management Plan (hereinafter “Plan”) in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Sections 3734.53, 3734.54, 3734.55 and 3734.56 on December 12, 2023.\n \nWHEREAS, SWACO has provided a copy of the Plan for ratification to each of the legislative authorities located in the Authority’s jurisdiction.\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus must decide whether it approves of said Plan within ninety (90) days of receipt of the Plan.\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, being the largest local government utilizing the SWACO landfill, approves of said Solid Waste Management Plan Update; and\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the City of Columbus approves the SWACO Solid Waste Management Plan Update.\n \nSECTION 2. The Clerk is hereby directed to send SWACO a copy of this resolution to the attention of Andrew Booker, SWACO, 4239 London Groveport Road, Grove City, Ohio 43123, or email Andrew.Booker@swaco.org.\n \nSECTION 3. That it is found and determined that all formal actions of this City Council concerning and relating to the adoption of this resolution were conducted at an open meeting of this Council and of any of its committees that resulted in such formal actions were in meetings open to the public in compliance with all legal requirements including Sections 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That this resolution shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
