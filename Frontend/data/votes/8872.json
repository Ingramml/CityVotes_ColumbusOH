    "description": "Explanation\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a three-year negotiated, sole source contract with Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) for software licensing, maintenance and support for the City’s geographic information systems (GIS). \n \nThe City’s GIS system supports several business applications utilized by city residents and city employees. The applications include but are not limited to: crime mapping, snow and ice operation applications, capital improvement projects mapping, utility dashboards, and zoning map applications. Authorization of this sole source contract will ensure continued access to the City’s current ESRI software portfolio, including the continuation of unlimited licensing of its most heavily used ESRI software products. This will ensure that the City can continue to meet emerging GIS technology needs expeditiously and cost-effectively.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the expenditure of $525,000.00 for the above-mentioned contract. This amount will cover the first year of the three-year negotiated contract, the term of which begins on April 15, 2024 and ends on April 14, 2025. Finally, this ordinance is being submitted in accordance with the sole source provisions of the Columbus City Codes Chapter 329. Sole source designation is requested as ESRI (which is the City’s technology standard for GIS software) is the sole provider of licensing, maintenance and support for its GIS software products.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for the above-described sole source contract are available, upon passage, of the 2024 Information Services operating budget. As such, this ordinance is contingent on the passage of the 2024 City of Columbus Operating Budget, Ordinance 3012-2023.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nEnvironmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI),\nVendor No.: 010901, Expiration Date: 02/12/2026\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency designation is requested to ensure that vital GIS services, in use in several city agencies, are not interrupted. A break in these services would have a direct and detrimental effect to our customers.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a three-year negotiated, sole source contract with Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.for an enterprise license agreement for software licensing, maintenance and support for the City’s geographic information systems in accordance with the sole source provisions of Columbus City Codes; to authorize the expenditure of $525,000.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Division, Information Services Operating Fund, and to declare an emergency.
