    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This legislation authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to execute those documents necessary to further amend the Agreement for Lease of Real Property for Agricultural Purposes, dated December 1, 2016, with Jeffrey L. Writsel and as amended by that First Amendment to Agreement for Lease of Real Property for Agricultural Purpose, dated December 1, 2019, to further reduce the tillable acreage of the Leased Premises used for farming around the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) and Compost Facility for the 2024 farming season. The Department of Public Utilities will begin construction in 2024 of a floodplain compensatory storage project, in compliance with a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) finding, that necessitates reducing the amount of tillable acreage leased to Mr. Writsel for farming by 82 acres. This reduction in the acreage comprising the Leased Premises from 276.2 tillable acres to 208.5 tillable acres will result in a $10,155.00 reduction in annual rental income to the City. \n \nFiscal Impact: The City’s annual lease income will be reduced by $10,155.00, to $31,275.00.\n \nEmergency Action: This legislation is presented as emergency in order to properly identify the fields and acreage associated with the Lease and to allow the Department of Public Utilities to immediately commence due diligence activities on the 82 acres in preparation for its construction project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to execute an Second Amendment to Agreement for Lease of Real Property for Agricultural Purposes with Jeffrey L.
