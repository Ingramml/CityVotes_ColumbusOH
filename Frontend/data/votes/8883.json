    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This amendment seeks to modify Ordinance No. 0245-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on January 22, 2024. \n \nSince the initial ordinance was passed, the vendor identified in the ordinance has changed its business organization type from a single-member LLC to an S-Corporation. In order to correctly contract with and pay the correct entity and to promptly pay for work that has already been performed starting on January 1, 2024, this amendment authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with the new entity and declares and emergency.\n \nThe original legislation authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Elizabeth Menduni (a single-member LLC registered with the Ohio Secretary of State as MKG Dept, LLC) in an amount up to $79,435.30 for the purpose of administering a program under Accelerate Columbus 2024. For the original legislation, the Department utilized the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with City procurements standards to solicit proposals.  Proposals were submitted in response to RFQ025308 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.  The Director of Development will enter into contract with ten organizations under the authority of Columbus City Code Section 329.18. These services cannot be provided by existing city employees as they do not have the resources to perform the program services.\n \nThrough Accelerate Columbus, the City seeks to nurture a pipeline of entrepreneurs and small businesses that reflects the talent and diversity of Columbus. The ultimate objective of Accelerate Columbus 2024 is to provide structured qualitatively and quantitatively measurable programs that strengthen the entrepreneurial ecosystem. In alignment with the Columbus Small Business Agenda, programs should have special consideration for businesses in low- to moderate-income areas, minority, and women-owned businesses.\n \nIn 2019, the City of Columbus launched Accelerate Columbus Small Business as part of a branded set of small business training, technical assistance, mentoring, and advisement programs targeting aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners. Initially offered as a pilot program, the goal of the program was to provide structured as well as on-demand training, one-on-one advisement, and technical assistance to both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs and small businesses.\n  \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delay in reimbursing for services already received and avoid a disruption in services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: None. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor is currently working to register the new entity with Vendor Services.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 0245-2024; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with MKG Dept LLC; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in 2019, the City of Columbus launched Accelerate Columbus Small Business as part of a branded set of small business training, technical assistance, and mentoring programs targeting aspiring entrepreneurs and existing small business owners; and\n \nWHEREAS, the goal of the program was to provide structured training and technical assistance to both aspiring and existing entrepreneurs and small businesses; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development seeks to partner with MKG Dept LLC for the purpose of administering a program under Accelerate Columbus 2024 program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Elizabeth Menduni (a single-member LLC registered with the Ohio Secretary of State as MKG Dept, LLC) has changed the business organization type from a single-member LLC to an S-Corporation; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend Ordinance 0245-2024 to allow for the contract to be entered into with the correct entity (MKG Dept LLC) and for payments to be correctly made to the new entity; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into contract with MKG Dept, LLC to avoid any delay in reimbursing for services already received, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
