    "description": "Explanation\n \nTo authorize and direct the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Director, to enter into various contracts for the purchase of mobile stage and related equipment; to authorize the appropriation of $285,850.00 within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285, to authorize the expenditure of $285,850.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund, to waive competitive bidding; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBackground: In a coordinated citywide effort to bring more educational, recreational and entertaining programs to Columbus neighborhoods starting in the summer of 2021, our office would like to purchase a mobile stage that gives our staff the flexibility to tow it easily to any part of the City and set up with ease within a short period of time. \n \nWith the COVID Pandemic impacting the lives of every citizen, it has been since 2019 that people have had an opportunity to gather in their own communities to celebrate, network and enjoy the quality of life our City has to offer. It is our desire to invigorate and unite neighborhoods throughout the city with diverse, stimulating and uplifting performing arts programs within just a few months. This endeavor also gives the City the rare opportunity to showcase local talent that has been unemployed for well over a year. The purchase of a small-size mobile stage would allow us to deliver quality performances in almost every type of park setting through the City.\n \nThe stage will be towed by a city vehicle and stored in the CRPD Warehouse during non-use.  \n \nOur initial quote from New Era Technology for the AV Production package design build was $240,000.00. New Era worked with the manufacturer “JBL” and we have received substantial discounts (approximately $75,000.00). Competitive bidding is requested to be waived due to the need to receive the equipment in time for use during performances for the abbreviated 2021 season.    \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nStageline Mobile Stage, Inc.                                    \n700 Marsolais Street, L’Assomption, Quebec, JSW 269 Canada                                                                  \nPierre-Olivier Sauve, Sales Mgr. 1-514-707-9002                                                             \n010654                                                  \n \nSI Technologies LLC\nDBA New Era Technology\nPO BOX 156\nIndianapolis, IN 46206                                                          \nCody Ramey 614-358-3967\n031931                                                             \n \nBid Waiver Justification: Stage purchase is necessary for delivering quality programs during the 2021 summer/fall season. Bid waiver form is attached to this legislation.\n \nBecause of the $75,000.00 discount and consistency of purchasing same brands and equipment as the department currently owns and operates, New Era was the best choice.\n \nThere will be no subcontractors.\n \nEmergency Justification: An emergency is being requested due to the Governor of Ohio lifting state COVID health mandates on outdoor events on April 5, 2021. Stage and sound system purchase is necessary for delivering quality programs during the 2021 summer/fall season. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Free outdoor performing arts events delivered by the City to local neighborhoods.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Local neighborhoods are eager to reconnect and network using safe and health protocols following the COVID Pandemic and the State of Ohio “stay at home” mandates.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: Enriching neighborhoods to build stronger communities.\n \nFiscal Impact: $285,850.00 is available from within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 to meet the financial obligations of these expenditures.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Recreation and Parks Department, to enter contracts with New Era Technology and Stageline Mobile Stage, Inc. for the purchase of a mobile stage and related equipment; to authorize the appropriation of $285,850.00 within the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285, to authorize the expenditure of $285,850.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund, to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; and to declare an emergency.
