    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD) to enter into contract with KNS Services, Inc. (KNS) for continued Genetec Advantage security camera software maintenance in accordance with the sole source procurement provisions of the City of Columbus City Codes.\n \nRecreation and Parks facilities have security cameras which have Genetec, Inc. brand operating systems. Sole source procurement provisions of the City of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 will be used to enter into these contracts as Genetec, Inc. requires the software to be upgraded and maintained by KNS Services, Inc. \n \nKNS has provided security camera software maintenance for CRPD for many years. They also provide this service for many other city departments including Public Safety, Finance, Public Service, and Public Utilities. They have established a unique relationship with the Department of Technology to provide robust service to multiple departments in the city. The City of Columbus selected the Genetec software platform years ago for all departments to utilize for their surveillance systems with the vision of aggregating these services citywide. This effort has resulted in KNS becoming the provider of these services for several departments as Genetec requires the software to be upgraded and maintained by KNS Services.\n \nA five-year commitment, subject to annual approval and authorization, creates an overall savings of $32,307.60 to the City of Columbus. Recreation and Parks Department cameras will cost $76,092.90 over this five-year period. A contract, purchase order, and invoice payment, in the amount of $15,218.58 yearly, will be administered by the Recreation and Parks Department. Initial contract term will commence March 1, 2024 and end February 28, 2029.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nKNS Services, Inc.\n8450 Rausch Drive\nPlain City, Ohio 43064\nNathan Bladen, 614-733-3880\nContract Compliance Number: 005443\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: February 22, 2025                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the execution of this contract before March 1 2023 to avoid a lapse in coverage, continuing the surveillance of our facilities and parks to support public safety. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This contract will provide reliability of all of our surveillance systems to assist in minimizing crime in our facilities and parks.  \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: We receive hundreds of calls from citizens regarding safety in parks every year. This contract will assist in improving the safety of our parks and facilities throughout the system. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving system wide security.\n \nFiscal Impact: The Recreation and Parks Department’s Genetec Advantage renewal totals $76,092.90 over the five-year period, which equals $15,218.58 annually from the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285. Yearly expenses are required and budgeted in the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund 2285 to meet the financial obligations of this agreement. This legislation does not provide for the expenditure.
