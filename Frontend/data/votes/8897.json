    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Williams Associate Architects Ltd. for the Glenwood and Windsor Swimming Pool Replacement Design Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $40,000.00. The original contract was authorized by Ordinance 0940-2021. \nThe Recreation and Parks Department undertook construction work at both Glenwood and Windsor pools, having them replaced and operating for the 2023 swim season. It was later identified that the water levels at Glenwood Pool were outside the tolerances established in the contract documents. As a result, corrective action is needed to bring the Glenwood Pool into compliance with the contract documents for proper operation from a health and safety perspective. \nThis second modification is required for the additional services required of the design professional to develop corrective action for the construction contractor. This modification is not expected to exceed $40,000.00. The final cost of this contract modification will be billed on a time and materials basis. These costs will be recovered from the construction contractor once the final costs are determined. It was not anticipated at the time this contract was started that additional services would be necessary due to the corrective actions needed at this facility. A separate procurement process would be detrimental to the project as it is in progress.\nPrincipal Parties: \nWilliams Associate Architects Ltd\n1335 Dublin Road, Suite 221-A \nColumbus, Ohio 43215                                                      \nTom Poulos, 614-705-1531, tcpoulos@williams-architects.com \nContract Compliance Number: 007307\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: November 30, 2023\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested due to health and safety concerns of water tolerance levels at these locations and to avoid a delay in the 2024 public pool season.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will benefit the public by improving two important recreational facilities that have served their respective communities for over 50 years. Improvements to our parks and facilities provide significant benefits to the neighborhoods in which they are located.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: As part of the Department’s Aquatics Capital Improvement Plan, residents in the service areas of these swimming pools have been and will continue to be engaged through their associations and commissions.  In addition, a project website has been established with a survey which is intended to gather pertinent information that will lead to a successful design and construction opportunity in the South Linden and Greater Hilltop Neighborhoods.  \n \nArea(s) Affected: East Columbus (50), Greater Hilltop (53)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving existing aquatics facilities.\n \nFiscal Impact: \n \nThe expenditure of $1,557,515.00 was legislated for the Glenwood and Windsor Swimming Pool Replacement Design contract by Ordinances 0940-2021 and 1329-2022. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $40,000.00. $40,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $1,597,515.00.   \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Williams Associate Architects Ltd for the Glenwood and Windsor Swimming Pool Replacement Design Project; to authorize the transfer of $40,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund, to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the expenditure of $40,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
