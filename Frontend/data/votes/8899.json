    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) for the McNaughten Road Greenspace Protection Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of the grant and matching funds. The grant amount is $620,120.00 and the local match amount is $224,880.00. There is a total of $845,000.00 available for this project being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nThe Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) accepted the Recreation and Parks application for the Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation program. OPWC administers statewide grant funding to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors and this ordinance authorizes an application for 2023 Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program grant funds. This grant will be used towards the fee simple acquisition of various sites in Columbus, including an eight acre greenspace on McNaughten Road in the City’s Far East Community. In July of 2023, Recreation and Parks applied for Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Funds for property acquisitions for the project, Ordinance 2103-2023. \n \nThis project will also acquire two parcels along the McNaughten Road corridor in the Far East Community of Columbus for greenspace preservation and a neighborhood park. The residents along the two and a half mile stretch of McNaughten Road, from East Broad Street to Livingston Avenue, have no parkland or protected natural area. The past three years have seen a substantial number of apartment development projects proposed or built.  These parcels are among the last remaining in the entire corridor that are possible for greenspace preservation. This parkland is on the south end of the McNaughten Road Corridor, near East Main Street. In 2019 and 2023, Columbus Recreation and Parks studied the McNaughten Road area as part of a citywide land plan. These neighborhoods rated among the City’s least served for parks and open spaces.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\nClean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program, Clean Ohio Conservation Fund - District 3\n65 East State Street, Suite 312\nColumbus, Ohio  43215\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested so that the Director of Recreation and Parks can immediately sign the grant agreement and accept the funding to meet the property acquisition deadline of April 15, 2024.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Protection of the City’s high quality waterways, greenway corridors, ravines, and urban forests is of great benefit to current and future generations. These sites are within rapidly urbanizing areas of the city and preservation of key natural sites is one of the main missions of Recreation and Parks. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During the past decade, residents in these communities, and the city at large, have expressed strong priority for more greenspaces, protected stream corridors access to nature, walking paths, and urban forest conservation.\n \nArea(s) Affected: \nFar East (58)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by improving access to trails and greenways corridors while providing safe connections to the regional trail network for nearby neighborhoods. It will provide long term protected corridors for walking, biking, and outdoor experiences while improving the equitable access to trails and greenways.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $620,120.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. This ordinance will also authorize a grant match of $224,880.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. $224,880.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of this grant match. There is a total of $845,000.00 available for this project. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once acquisition is ready to move forward.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) for the McNaughten Road Greenspace Protection Project and accept a grant in the amount of $620,120.00 with a local match of $224,880.00; to authorize the appropriation of $620,120.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund; to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget Ordinance; to authorize the transfer of $224,880.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
