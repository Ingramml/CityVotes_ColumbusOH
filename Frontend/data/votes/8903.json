    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1859-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on June 26, 2023, to allow for the a correction that reflects that the grant allows for food and non-alcoholic beverages to be served at events as well as allows for Designing Local LTD., to facilitate travel for select city employees and to pay for those expenses based on the contract which was authorized with Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant funds.  This language was inadvertently omitted and needs to be corrected and to be reflective of the effective date of the contract.  \n \nOrdinance No. 1859-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on June 26, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a professional service agreement with Designing Local Ltd., to serve as the City’s lead consultant for the “Reimagining Columbus” project.  \n \nThe City proposed the Reimagining Columbus project to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and was awarded a $2 million grant. As the lead consultant for project, Designing Local will be responsible project management, community engagement, landscape architecture, and oversight of subconsultants.  Subconsultants will include experts in public engagement, cultural competency, public art, place making, and design and augmented with the perspectives of Advisory Committees composed of local residents and community leaders. The project will use conventional and restorative practices to glean insight and support the sharing of different perspectives and lived experiences.  The grant allows for food and non-alcoholic beverages to be served during community engagement events, and the travel of the consultants and select city employees to other cities to participate in a learning exchange.  The purpose of this learning exchange is to gain knowledge from others who are also engaged in similar initiatives or can otherwise provide contextual information related to cultural, legal, or procedural issues or concerns.  These items are part of the existing budget for community engagement and learning exchange and have been approved by the Grantor.  \n \nOn February 28, 2024, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation confirmed to the City, in writing, that food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses were authorized to be spent from the grant award funding.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to allow for the approval and reimbursement of those expenses incurred since the effective date of the agreement, to prevent Designing Local LTD from experiencing financial hardship.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 020995 and expires 7/14/2024.\n \nTitle\n To amend Ordinance No. 1859-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on June 26, 2023, to authorize the payment of food and non-alcoholic beverages expenses as well as the payment of travel expenses of select city employees in connection with the Reimagining Columbus project, managed by Designing Local LTD; and to declare an emergency.
