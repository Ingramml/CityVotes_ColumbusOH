The city and partner organizations brought together more than 500 B&YMOC to ensure that Columbus’ My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) work was grounded in testimony from the target population. Numerous non-profit service providers, schools, and companies have created programs to serve vulnerable youth of color since the launch of the national MBK initiative. \n \nThe services cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current responsibility and capacity to provide. \n \nEmergency Action is necessary to avoid causing interruptions in the delivery of program services to address the needs of boys and young men of color, including access to mentors and mental health services. \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the General Fund.\n \nContract Compliance:\n033495 Africentric Personal Development Shop Inc and is valid 11/14/2024\n006073 Columbus Urban League and is valid 6/9/2025\n021274 Ohio Haitian Community Network and is pending.  Contract Compliance will be completed before grant funding is received.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into grant agreements with the following non-profit entities: Africentric Personal Development Shop Inc, Columbus Urban League and Ohio Haitian Community Network in alignment with MBK national milestones to improve outcomes for boys and young men of color, to authorize the expenditure of up to $183,926.00 from the General Fund, and to declare an emergency.
