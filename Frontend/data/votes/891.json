    "description": "Explanation\n \n1.                     BACKGROUND:  The Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant operates two (2) screening channels as part of the headworks unit treatment process. The current screenings press was installed in 2008 as part of J210. Due to the larger amount of screenings, leaves and debris in the raw sewage the screening press is unable to keep up with output from the mechanical screens. Additionally the Screen Room was constructed in the 1930’s and requires a holistic evaluation to ensure the equipment and building systems are providing the appropriate service for treatment and plant staff. Planning, design, and construction of the screening improvements will be conducted to avoid continued adverse impact to treatment. \n \nStep 1 of this project, Preliminary Design, will include the following tasks: 1. Review existing facility information, 2. Provide an assessment of the screening system and building,  3. Develop design criteria and basis of design for the project, 4. Provide an evaluation and analysis for the screen system and building.\n \nThe City received the Final DDM on September 17, 2020. Step 2, Detailed Design includes preparing construction contract documents (including specifications and drawings) in accordance with City of Columbus Division of Sewerage and Drainage standards, guidelines, and directions for construction and implementation of the proposed facility. Detailed Design will also include attendance at plan and specification review meetings, assisting in negotiations, permitting, and other matters with U.S. EPA, Ohio EPA, and other government agencies as necessary, and bidding services (which includes assisting at the Pre-Bid Conference, and bid opening, making an award recommendation for lowest and best bide, and preparing Conformed to Contract Documents).\n \nA future, second renewal will be requested for Step 3, Engineering Services During Construction, which will include technical project representation (TPR) duties, construction phase engineering, start-up and commissioning assistance, and record documentation.\n \nPlanning Area is 99 - Citywide \n \n  1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,878,897.00\n                             Cost summary: \n                       ORIGINAL CONTRACT (Step 1, Preliminary Design)                        $  787,950.00\n                     RENEWAL #1 (Step 2, Detailed Design -this ordinance)   $1,878,897.00\n                     RENEWAL #2 (Step 3, Future Planned)                                                 $ 880,000.00                          \n   Estimated Contract Costs                                                 $3,546,847.00\n \n       1.2 Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \n This was planned contract modification/renewal. It extends the time and adds funding to perform   additional task ordered work.\n \n1.3 Reasons other procurement processes are not used:  \nBidding out this work would risk funding this substantial startup effort again, and would require the multi-year work to start again at the beginning. \n \n1.4 How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost proposal was provided by Burgess & Niple, Inc., reviewed by the Division of Sewerage and Drainage and was deemed acceptable. \n \n \n2.   PROJECT TIMELINE: The Professional Engineer Services Agreement was signed in May 2019 and provided Step 1, Preliminary Design Services. Step 2 services are anticipated to begin May of 2021 and are anticipated to end in August 2022. Bids will be received in the third quarter of 2022 and it is anticipated that the Notice to Proceed for the construction contract will be given in the first quarter of 2023. Step 3 services will be obtained through a second contract renewal in the first quarter of 2023 corresponding to the construction contract. The Professional Engineering Services Contract will continue beyond completion of construction to provide “as built” record documents of the constructed facilities.\n \n3.                     EMERGENCY DESIGNATION: An emergency designation is not requested at this time.\n \n4.                     CONTRACT COMPIANCE NO: 31-0885550 | MAJ | Exp. 2/21/2022 | Vendor # 004425\n \n5.                     ECONOMIC IMPACT: The JPWWTP screening improvements project will ensure that debris continues to be removed from the incoming wastewater for disposal. This process protects the downstream equipment from debris that would otherwise cause plugging resulting in excessive downtime for repairs. Effective removal of debris will ensure the downstream equipment is protected so the plants equipment remains and capacity is not reduced due to screenings debris.  \n \n6.   FISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the transfer within and expenditure of up to $1,878,897.00 from the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget is also necessary.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to renew an existing engineering agreement with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant Screening Improvements Project; to transfer and expend up to $1,878,897.00 within the Sanitary Sewer General Obligation Bond Fund; and to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget.
