    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: \n \nThis legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1710-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on July 10, 2023, to allow for a correction to the names of three organizations listed in Exhibit A. \n \nOrdinance No. 1710-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on July 10, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into 32 service contracts for the provision of home-delivered meals, adult day care, transportation, home repair, and legal services for the period July 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024.\n \nExhibit A included organizations with the names “The Legal Aid Society of Columbus” and “Ohio State Legal Services Association”. It recently came to the attention of COAAA that these not-for-profit agencies have undergone a merger in 2024 and are now operating under the name “Legal Aid of Southeast and Central Ohio”. As such, COAAA requires a contract modification to continue the services contract for the remainder of the contract period. \n \nExhibit A also included an organization with the name “Accountable Transportation, LLC.” It was recently discovered that the name listed for this organization must be updated to comply with City Auditor requirements. Thus, COAAA must modify the contract by replacing the name from “Accountable Transportation, LLC” to “Fionkina Marina, DBA: Accountable Transportation” to appropriately execute the contract.\n \nEmergency Designation\n \nAll other information in Exhibit A remains the same.
