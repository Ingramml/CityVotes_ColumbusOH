    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 2945-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on November 20, 2023, to allow for a correction of one organization name listed. \n \nOrdinance No. 2945-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on November 20, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into professional service contracts for the provision of adult day care, transportation, and legal services for the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.\n \nOrdinance No. 2945-2023 included an organization with the name “Accountable Transportation, LLC.” It was recently discovered that the name listed for this organization must be updated to comply with City Auditor requirements. Thus, COAAA must modify the contract by replacing the name from “Accountable Transportation, LLC” to “Fionkina Marina, DBA: Accountable Transportation, LLC” to appropriately execute the contract.\n \nEmergency Designation\n \nAll other information in Ordinance No. 2945-2023, including Exhibit A, remains the same. Emergency action is requested to prevent delay in services to older adults and people with disabilities in the Central Ohio region.\n \nFiscal Impact\n \nNo additional expenditures are required. \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 2945-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on November 20, 2023, to allow for a correction of one of the organizations listed from “Accountable Transportation, LLC” to “Fionkina Marina, DBA: Accountable Transportation, LLC”; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2945-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on November 20, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks to enter into professional service contracts for the provision of adult day care, transportation, and legal services for the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024.\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 2945-2023 included an organization with the name “Accountable Transportation, LLC”; and\n \nWHEREAS, the name listed for “Accountable Transportation, LLC” must be updated to comply with City Auditor requirements. Thus, COAAA must modify the contract by replacing the name from “Accountable Transportation, LLC” to “Fionkina Marina, DBA: Accountable Transportation” to appropriately execute the contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Recreation and Parks requests that Ordinance No. 2945-2023 be amended in order to correct the organization name; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Recreation and Parks in that it is immediately necessary to amend Ordinance 2945-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on November 20, 2023, to reflect the name change of the entity providing services from \"Accountable Transportation, LLC\" to \"Fionkina Marina, DBA Accountable Transportation, LLC to prevent delay in delivery of services to older adults and people with disabilities in the Central Ohio region, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
