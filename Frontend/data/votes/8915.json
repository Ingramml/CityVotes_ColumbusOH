    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to enter into a not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio to provide fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time (OBAT) program for an amount not to exceed $100,000.00.\n \nThe OBAT program is a micro community intervention aimed at increasing the health and wellness of one block in the Linden area. OBAT requires a fiscal agent due to the nature of the interventions, including meeting emergent needs for residents, purchasing and providing items and food for block events, supporting home repairs and physical improvements, gift cards, and other program incidentals.\n \nColumbus Public Health and it's staff are not able to provide fiscal agent services to this program due to the nature of the purchases and lack of capacity to facilitate the numerous procurement requests associated with the program. It is in the best interest of the City and the community that these services be rendered under a not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio.\n \nThe contract period is from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025.\n \nMental Health America of Ohio is a nonprofit entity and is exempt from contract compliance certification.\n \nEmergency action is being requested in order to avoid a gap in this critical service and to meet the ongoing demands of the intervention activities provided by the Columbus Public Health One Block at a Time program within the Linden community.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Expenditures to provide these services are budgeted in the 2024 Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250, contingent upon passage of Ordinance 3012-2023. ($100,000.00)\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Board of Health to enter into a not-for-profit services contract with Mental Health America of Ohio to provide fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time (OBAT) program; to authorize an expenditure from the Health Special Revenue Fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency.  ($100,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Board of Health has a need for fiscal agent services to facilitate Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Mental Health America of Ohio has the expertise and resources required to carry out these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to enter into a not-for-profit contract with Mental Health America of Ohio to provide fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program, in order to avoid a gap in this critical service and to meet the ongoing demands of the intervention activities provided to the Linden community all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with Mental Health America of Ohio to provide fiscal agent services to Columbus Public Health’s One Block at a Time program in an amount not to exceed $100,000.00 for the period of April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the costs of said not-for-profit contract, the expenditure of $100,000.00 is hereby authorized from the Health Special Revenue Fund, Fund No. 2250, Department 50, Division 5001, per the accounting codes attached to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.  That this not-for-profit contract is in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all not-for-profit contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance and to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that this not-for-profit contract is properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the City's financial records.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
