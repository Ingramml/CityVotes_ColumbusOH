    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  Columbus Public Health (CPH) has been awarded grant funds from the Reproductive Health National Training Center (RHNTC) originating from the Office of Population Affairs Title X Family Planning Program.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $25,000.00 in grant monies to fund the RHNTC Mini-Grant: Congenital Syphilis Prevention Program for the period of March 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024. \n \nThe RHNTC Mini-grants program support implementation of evidence-based approaches to improve maternal health outcomes. Priority was given to strategies to reduce racial disparities in maternal health outcomes for Title X or TPP-funded agencies. This grant will support the CPH Women’s Health and Sexual Health and Wellness Centers to pilot a project to increase syphilis screening and early pregnancy detection among individuals with reproductive potential in areas experiencing a surge in congenital syphilis; to increase access to contraception and other Title X health services; and to partner with community agencies to build trust and provide linkage to residents with SUD that may also be homeless and survivors of human trafficking. \n \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency to avoid forfeiture of the grant; to meet the deliverables of the grant; and to increase capacity to improve maternal and child health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases affecting public health and safety;\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The RHNTC Mini-Grant: Congenital Syphilis Prevention Program is funded by the Reproductive Health National Training Center and does not generate revenue or require a City Match.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant funds from the Reproductive Health National Training Center for the RHNTC Mini-Grant: Congenital Syphilis Prevention Program in the amount of $25,000.00;

and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to accept these grant funds from the Reproductive Health National Training Center and to appropriate these funds to the Health Department to avoid forfeiture of the grant, to meet the deliverables of the grant, and to increase capacity to improve maternal and child health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases affecting public health and safety, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare;
