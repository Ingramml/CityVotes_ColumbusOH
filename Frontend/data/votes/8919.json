    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety to enter into the third (3rd) renewal of an existing contract with ZOLL Medical Corporation on behalf of the Division of Fire for extended warranty and preventative maintenance services in the amount of $91,705.32 that was authorized by ordinance # 0977-2022 and which provides warranty and preventative maintenance coverage for the Fire Division's ZOLL defibrillators/monitors used in daily emergency medical service (EMS) operations.  The Fire Division needs to purchase these warranty and preventative maintenance services, as ZOLL defibrillators/monitors are used on its emergency medical and first responder vehicles in order to assess and respond to cardiovascular emergencies using this highly specialized and technical equipment that requires services as specified by the manufacturer.  The Division of Fire purchases preventative maintenance and extended warranty services directly from ZOLL Medical Corporation versus ZOLL unauthorized service providers which allows the Division to secure the lowest pricing available.  As the Division of Fire has standardized on the ZOLL defibrillator/monitor product, it is critical that the Division be able to maintain this equipment.  ZOLL Medical Corporation is sole authorized service agent for the ZOLL defibrillators/monitors. The contract authorized by ordinance 0977-2022 consists of five (5) annual payments of $91,705.32 each, totaling $458,526.60 in the final year of the contract that ends on June 30, 2027.  This contract provides for technical on-site preventative maintenance services, as well as discounts on supplies and loaner equipment to ensure the Fire Division is not without this potentially life-saving device.\n \nVendor Data:  ZOLL Medical Corporation #04-2711626 Vendor #000197\n \nEmergency Designation:   Emergency action is requested to ensure that this vital, highly specialized equipment receives uninterrupted warranty and preventative maintenance services as it is consistently utilized during the Division of Fire’s EMS operations to potentially save lives.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:    This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $91,705.32 from the Division of Fire's general fund operating budget to purchase extended warranty and preventative maintenance services. The Fire Division is budgeted $687,500.00 for maintenance services in their 2024 General Fund Budget, and has spent $91,705.32 in both 2022 & 2023 for ZOLL's PM services.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize and direct the Director of Public Safety to renew the existing contract with ZOLL Medical Corporation on behalf of the Division of Fire as authorized by ordinance 0977-2022 for extended warranty and preventative maintenance services for the ZOLL devices; to authorize the expenditure of $91,705.32 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
