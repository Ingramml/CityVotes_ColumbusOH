Only homes deemed eligible by the City of Columbus, Department of Public Utilities, Division of Sewerage and Drainage qualify for this program. Under this program an eligible home with an interior perimeter foundation drain connection to the lateral is also eligible, at the owner’s option, for the installation of a sump pump that will redirect the foundation drainage away from the sanitary lateral to the sump pump and then discharge that drainage away from the house.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities advertised formal bids on Vendor Services and solicited formal bids on Bonfire (RFQ018044).
