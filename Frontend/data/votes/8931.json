    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to modify a service contract with Fresh Bloom Bins, to add funds for year two of the initial contract term for 300 Gallon Removal and Disposal services, in the amount of $90,000.00; to authorize the Director of Public Service to execute contract modifications if needed to clarify terms and conditions of the contract or to implement program improvements and enhancements. The Department of Public Service has an ongoing need for contractual services for the removal and disposal of 300 gallon refuse containers throughout the City, as areas are transitioned to 90 gallon containers.\n \nIn 2023, the Department of Public Service solicited Requests for Proposals (Solicitation RFQ025208) for the removal and disposal of 300 gallon refuse containers for the Department of Public Service, Division of Refuse Collection, which was awarded to Fresh Bloom Bins.\n \nPublic Service would like to modify the contract, and add funds in the amount of up to $90,000.00 to pay for these continued services.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $90,000.00\n \nThe original contract amount:                                                    $48,000.00                    (PO395534)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                 $90,000.00                   (PO419695)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                                           $90,000.00                              (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                         $228,000.00\n \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Fresh Bloom Bins.\n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis contract is used for removing 300 gallon containers from areas of the City where illegal dumping has become problematic, and replacing them with individual, 90 gallon containers. The conversion process has accelerated, and therefore it is necessary to encumber additional funds, so work can continue without interruption. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe vendor has an existing one-year contract executed on July 13, 2023. There is an option for three (3) one (1) year renewals. Therefore a bid is not needed at this time.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification and extension is consistent with rates that were established by historical data from invoices the City has paid thus far for services rendered.\n \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nFresh Bloom Bins contract compliance number is WBE-032875 and expires 1/23/2026.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThis planned contract modification and expenditure is appropriated in the Division of Refuse Collection's 2024 General Fund budget.\n \n \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis is a minority and woman owned business.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow timely execution of this contract modification, to prevent a lapse in the conversion of 300 gallon containers to 90 gallon containers in zones throughout the City, in order to decrease illegal dumping. \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Interim Director of Public Service to modify a contract with Fresh Bloom Bins for 300 Gallon removal and disposal services; to authorize the expenditure of $90,000.00 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($90,000.00)\n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service requires 300 Gallon Removal and Disposal services; and \n \nWHEREAS, a one year contract with three one-year renewal options to perform these services was awarded to Fresh Bloom Bins (RFQ025208); and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize a modification to the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to add funds to the contract; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $90,000.00 from the Division of Refuse Collection from the General Fund; and \n   \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Public Service Department, Division of Refuse Collection, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Interim Director to modify the contract with Fresh Bloom Bins to prevent a lapse in the conversion of 300 gallon containers zones throughout the City, in order to decrease illegal dumping, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
