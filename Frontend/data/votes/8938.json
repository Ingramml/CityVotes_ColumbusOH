This legislation will also authorize the receipt of funds from Franklin County and a participation agreement outlining the use of those funds for this project. \n \nThe appropriation and expenditure of $1,432,049.76 will be needed within the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Fund 2248.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to enter into a construction contract with General Temperature Control for the HVAC Renovation for Gladden House Project;
