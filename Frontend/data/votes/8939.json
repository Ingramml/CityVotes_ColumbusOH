    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The Director of Human Resources seeks the authority to utilize the services of Baker & Hostetler LLP for consulting services connected to collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.  Baker & Hostetler LLP has been solicited to provide assistance because of its experience representing the City of Columbus in previous negotiations with all bargaining units.  Ordinance 0012-2024 authorizes the City Attorney to engage Baker & Hostetler LLP to provide advice in connection to collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.  This legislation authorizes the Department of Human Resources to enter into contract for professional consulting services with Baker & Hostetler LLP.\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Human Resources to enter into contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP and will further authorize the expenditure of $250,000.00 to compensate the contractor for services rendered in conjunction with collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.  The competitive bid process would not be conducive to ongoing and anticipated negotiations, as this firm brings a wealth of institutional knowledge and experience in ongoing labor relations issues with the City of Columbus.  Therefore, competitive bidding requirements are being waived.  \nBaker & Hostetler LLP's contract compliance number is 340082025.\n Fiscal Impact:  Funds totaling $250,000.00 are budgeted specifically for this contract in the Department of Human Resources 2024 employee benefits fund budget; the availability of funds is contingent on the passage of the 2024 Other Funds budget ordinance 3012-2023.\nEmergency Action:  Emergency action is being requested to allow for continuation of representation of the firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP throughout collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.   Currently, ongoing bargaining unit negotiations include FOP and IAFF. Those contracts expired December 8, 2023 and October 31, 2023 respectively. Additionally, AFSCME 1632 negotiations will begin in late February 2024.\nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Human Resources to enter into contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP for the purpose of providing consulting services connected to collective bargaining negotiations and related activities; to authorize the expenditure of $250,000.00 from the employee benefits fund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of the Columbus City Code; and to declare an emergency.

That the Director of the Department of Human Resources is hereby authorized to enter into contract with Baker & Hostetler LLP for the purpose of providing professional consulting services to the Department in collective bargaining negotiations and related activities.\nSECTION 2.  That Council finds it is in the City’s best interests to waive the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes regarding competitive bidding, and the same are hereby waived.\nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $250,000.00 or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby authorized to be expended from the employee benefits fund 5502 in object class 03 Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \nSECTION 5.   That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves or vetoes the same.",
