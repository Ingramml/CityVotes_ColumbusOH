    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Codes Chapter 329 and to establish contracts for Property Maintenance and Lawn Mowing services for properties held by the Division of Land Redevelopment and to authorize the expenditure of $1,210,000.00.  Services include trash and debris removal from structures, cleaning and abatement of vacant lots, lawn mowing, tree services, brush clearing, trash pickup, and similar work. Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase orders, starting March 1, 2024.\nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ026253 through the Vendor Services portal on November 17, 2023, and accepted proposals for property and lawn maintenance services through the Bonfire portal on December 15, 2023.  A total of nineteen (19) responses were received.  A total of 13 contractors were selected by an evaluation committee consisting of Staff from the Department of Development and the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  The qualifications were based on prior experience, equipment, staffing, and other factors.  The resulting contracts will be established for one year with an option to extend an additional year.  \nThe Department will establish 10 contracts for property maintenance services and 8 contracts for lawn maintenance, with a total of 13 contractors being selected, with some contractors performing both property and lawn maintenance services.  Of the total contracts, 50% will be issued to MBE or WBE contractors.  If all contractors who qualify for the MBE/WBE certification obtain the certification, the percentage could increase to 89%.  The Division will encourage the contractors to obtain/renew their certifications. \nAt the time of this legislation, the Department of Development can move forward with awarding ten (10) contractors a total of fourteen (14) contracts.  The Department will return to Council once the three (3) remaining vendors have updated their vendor accounts, allowing the establishment of their respective four (4) contracts.\nThe new prices will require an additional appropriation to the current budget as authorized by Ordinance 3344-2023.  Current property maintenance contracts expire at the end of February; this legislation will also allow the payment of services on an emergency basis between the expiration of current contracts and the establishment of new purchase orders.\nBid Waiver Justification: City Code 329 was modified to require all service contractors to pay a responsible wage and provide a health insurance benefit.  Land Redevelopment and Fiscal found the Invitation to Bid (ITB) process does not allow a City agency to negotiate pricing to ensure awarded bidders account for responsible wage requirements.  In addition, the ITB process is limited to the lowest bid rather than weighing the contractor’s ability and capacity to perform the demand of the contract.   \nBy processing the procurement project as a Request for Statement of Qualifications (RFSQ) and scoring each offeror on their experience, equipment, and personnel allowed the evaluation committee to determine the most qualified contractors to perform the services on city-owned parcels.  \nThe Division of Land Redevelopment published and notified registered vendors of the procurement project through the City’s Vendor Services portal and bulletin. \nThe RFQ provided instructions to submit supporting documentation on the City’s Bonfire portal. \nA bid waiver is required to enter into contracts because the Request for Statement of Qualifications (City Code 329.27) process allows agencies to award only professional service contracts, and technical proposals were not requested from offers since we provided technical specification requirements to follow.  \n \nEmergency action is requested in order to start mowing services this spring and to decrease the amount of time the Land Bank will be without property maintenance contractors.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the Land Management Fund, fund 2206.\n \nAWARD VENDORS: \n \n\n\n\nVendor                     Vendor\n\nLawn                   Property \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n Number  \n\n \n\nMaintenance  \n\nMaintenance \n\n\n\n012297\n\nConsolidated Services & Management LLC\n\n$90,000\n\n$80,000\n\n\n\n003246\n\nLima Jean J. \n\n \n\n$40,000\n\n\n\n031981\n\nL.
