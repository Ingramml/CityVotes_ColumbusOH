    "description": "Explanation\n \nIn a continued effort to improve operational efficiencies, provide better services to the public, and to streamline government organization and communication, it was determined that the Licensing Section and the Weights and Measures Section should be relocated from the Department of Public Safety to the Department of Building and Zoning Services.\n \nThis move will improve upon the existing strong coordination between the Licensing Section and the Department of Building and Zoning Services’ Division of Code Enforcement which work together currently on licensing issues involving food trucks, massage parlors, and the like. The code changes made by this ordinance will make the necessary adjustments to allow for the smooth and seamless transfer of this enforcement authority.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Separate legislation will address the required fiscal and human resource changes.\nEmergency Justification: Achieving this transfer as soon as possible will allow the Department of Building and Zoning Services to assimilate the Licensing Section and Weights and Measures Section and their processes into the current system so that the transfer will be effective at the start of the second quarter of the year on April 1, 2024. \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend and repeal various code sections in Chapter 216, Chapter 217, Title 5, and Title 29 of the Columbus City Codes in order to transfer the Licensing Section and the Weights and Measures Section from the Department of Public Safety to the Department of Building and Zoning Services; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in an continued effort to improve operational efficiencies, provide better services to the public, and to streamline government organization and communication, it was determined that the  Licensing Section and the Weights and Measures Section should be relocated from the Department of Public Safety to the Department of Building and Zoning Services; and\nWHEREAS, this move will improve upon the existing strong coordination between the Licensing Section and the Department of Building and Zoning Services’  Division of Code Enforcement; and\nWHEREAS, the code changes made by this ordinance will make the necessary adjustments to allow for the smooth and seamless transfer of this enforcement authority; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to amend and repeal various code sections to transfer the Licensing Section and the Weights and Measures Section from the Department of Public Safety to the Department of Building and Zoning Services so the transfer is effective on April 1, 2024; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSection 1.
