    "title": "To accept various deeds for parcels of real property to be used as road right-of-way; to dedicate these parcels as public rights-of-way; and to name said rights-of-way as public roadways as described within this Ordinance.  ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nFrom time to time, various parcels of land are deeded to the City of Columbus for public street and/or alley purposes.  One such example when this occurs is streets included in the Columbus Thoroughfare Plan.  Streets listed within the Plan have a pre-defined amount of required right-of-way.  If that right-of-way width is lacking for a particular property, then the additional right-of-way must be deeded to the City when that property is sold or is being redeveloped.  Another example is when developers install sidewalks, turn lanes, etc., on a property within the public right-of-way.  The City requires such improvements to be located entirely within the public right-of-way.  If any part of such improvements are outside of the public right-of-way, the developer must deed that part of the land to the City.  Many of the deeded amounts are for very small pieces of land.  All of the deeded land transactions go through the City Attorney's Office.\n \nThe Department of Public Service maintains a list of the deeded land and periodically submits the list to City Council for acceptance of the deeded land.  Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03 requires that property proposed for use as a public street or alley must be accepted and dedicated as public right-of-way by an ordinance specifically passed for such purpose.  This Ordinance provides for the City to accept deeds for various parcels of real property, to dedicate the parcels as road right-of-way, and to name the parcels as public roadways to comply with Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03.  Passage of this Ordinance also exempts the property deeded to the City from property taxes.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThere is no expenditure associated with this Ordinance.\n \nTitle\n \nTo accept various deeds for parcels of real property to be used as road right-of-way; to dedicate these parcels as public rights-of-way; and to name said rights-of-way as public roadways as described within this Ordinance.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 723.03 requires that property to be used as a public street or alley must be accepted and dedicated as public right-of-way by an ordinance specially passed for such purpose; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus has been asked to accept various deeds for real property, to dedicate those parcels of real property for the purpose of road right-of-way, and to name said property as public roadways; and\n \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a GENERAL WARRANTY DEED recorded in the Franklin County, Ohio, Recorder’s Office, on January 4, 2023 as Instrument Number 202301040000688, Chick-Fil-A, Inc. has deeded property to the City of Columbus, to be used as Morse Road right-of-way; and\n \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a GENERAL WARRANTY DEED recorded in the Franklin County, Ohio, Recorder’s Office, on January 4, 2023 as Instrument Number 202301040000687, Fairfax Apartments LLC has deeded property to the City of Columbus, to be used as Kenny Road right-of-way; and\n \nWHEREAS, by virtue of a QUITCLAIM DEED recorded in the Franklin County, Ohio, Recorder’s Office, on January 4, 2023 as Instrument Number 202301040000686, Anthony M.
