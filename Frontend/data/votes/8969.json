These encroachments consist of 128 permanent tiebacks underground and shoring to remain but removed at least 5 feet below finished grade into Parsons Avenue right-of-way. The area extending into the right-of-way is approximately 85 feet in width and from the southerly right-of-way line of I-70 to just north of Childrens Crossroads intersection. This project is located at 580 Childrens Drive. This project is a new addition to the hospital’s complex along the east side of Parsons Avenue. These encroachments are located within the right-of-way as described above and within the attached exhibit. \n \nThe following legislation authorizes the Interim Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary for the City to grant these encroachments to legally allow them to extend into the public rights-of-way.
