    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes and directs the Director of the Department of Human Resources to extend a contract with The Bridgefield Group for executive coaching services. This ordinance represents an extension of the current contract through December 31, 2024. No additional funding is required.\nThe initial contract with The Bridgefield Group was authorized under ordinance 0945-2023. The current contract expires March 31, 2024.
