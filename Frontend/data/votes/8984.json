    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with NCLC Housing & Development Foundation for a Joint venture between Sunset Development and NCJC Housing & Development Foundation. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation will allow the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Housing Development Agreement with NCJC Housing & Development Foundation (“NCJCs”) for the NCJC Downtown Campus (“Project”), which will ultimately be funded with a future Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond. Once funds become available, an ordinance will be brought to Council to authorize a grant agreement.\n \nNCJC Downtown Campus (“Project”) is a proposed affordable housing tax credit development with a total of 120 units of housing over a pad with parking and commercial space located at 266 E. Main Street.\nThe development is being proposed as a joint venture between Sunset Development and the NCJC Housing & Development Foundation (“NCJCs”), which is a local nonprofit. Sunset Development has been involved in the development of affordable housing throughout Ohio for 20 years as a consultant, developer and owner.  The NCJCs are a non-profit formed in 2009 with a grant from the Board of the Jaycee Arms HUD 202 for the purpose of providing housing and services to families throughout Ohio.  They currently own three Section 8 subsidized projects as well as numerous single-family rentals.  In September of 2020 the Board of the Jaycee Arms donated through a refinance and lot split, two parcels of land adjacent to the Jaycee Arms, for the purpose of developing affordable housing.  The larger of the two lots sits between the existing Jaycee Arms and East Main Street and is 1.74 acres. The smaller of the two parcels sits directly to the West of the Jaycee Arms and is 0.38 acres.\nThe Project will serve families and consist of 120 units including 58 one-bedroom units, 48 two-bedroom units and 14 three-bedroom units.  It will obtain LEED Silver Green Certification and will also provide for resident parking and amenities such as playground and exercise equipment.  The rents will be affordable to families at or below 30 to 80% of the Franklin County AMI using Income Averaging with an overall average AMI between 55 and 60%.  24 units will be set aside at the 30% AMI rent, which could potentially serve individuals that income qualify, but currently reside in local shelters. Social Service Coordination will be provided to the residents by NCJC Housing & Development Foundation through partnerships with local area providers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is needed.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 048036 and expires February 2, 2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with NCLC Housing & Development Foundation for a Joint venture between Sunset Development and NCJC Housing & Development Foundation. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development seeks to enter into a Housing Development Agreement (HDA) with NCJC Housing & Development Foundation for the development; and\n \nWHEREAS, the HDA would memorialize the City’s desired commitment to the project, pending City Council approval and future availability of funds; and\n \nWHEREAS, the development is being proposed as a joint venture between Sunset Development and the NCJC Housing & Development Foundation (“NCJCs”); and\n \nWHEREAS, the Project will serve families and consist of 120 units including 58 one-bedroom units, 48 two-bedroom units and 14 three-bedroom units; and \n \nWHEREAS, the project will obtain LEED Silver Green Certification; and\n \nWHEREAS, the rents will be affordable to families at or below 30 to 80% of the Franklin County AMI; and\n \nWHEREAS, The Department of Development wishes to support this project by contributing $3,875,000.00 of bond funds upon availability, Affordable Housing Bond; and\n \nWHEREAS, this legislation would authorize the Director of Development to first execute the HDA and pending the availability of funding from the Capital Budget, Affordable Housing Bond the Department will seek City Council’s approval to enter into a grant agreement; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
