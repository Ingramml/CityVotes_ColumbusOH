    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services to modify and extend the professional services contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. for the Zoning Code and Map Update project for the extension of the contract term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025.  The initial contract in May 2022 was for a 24-month period and was authorized by Ordinance 1041-2022.  Because the project was expected to extend beyond two years, the contract included two optional twelve-month extensions, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation. This extension authorizes the first of two extensions, with no additional funding.  Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. will continue the work advising on the updates to the Zoning Code as an important tool in proactively managing the growth and development in Columbus.\n                     \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  Lisa Wise Consulting’s contract compliance number is CC033454. \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency ordinance is necessary in order to extend the contract prior to its expiration on May 8, 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no additional funding necessary for this ordinance.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Building and Zoning Services Department to modify and extend the professional services contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. for the Zoning Code and Map Update project for the extension of the contract term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City undertook an independent analysis of the Zoning Code and process, which determined that the current code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city; and\n \nWHEREAS, an updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Finance, Purchasing Office solicited Requests for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Zoning Code and Map Update contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, Lisa Wise Consulting submitted a responsive proposal as determined by the evaluation committee and the Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized negotiations with the firm; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department entered into a contract with Lisa Wise Consulting for the provision of professional consulting services in the amount of up to $1,849,637.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, because the project was expected to extend beyond two years, the contract included two optional twelve-month extensions beyond the initial 24-month period, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to modify and extend the contract from the term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025, to allow Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. to continue its work on the Zoning Code update; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify and extend the contract with Lisa Wise Consulting prior to the current expiration date of the contract, for the preservation of the public peace, property, health safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Building and Zoning Services be, and hereby is, authorized to modify and extend the professional services contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, Inc. for the Zoning Code and Map Update project for the extension of the contract term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
