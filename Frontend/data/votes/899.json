    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Civil Service Commission Executive Director to renew a contract with Excelsoft Technologies, Inc. for exam item bank management and administration software as a service (SaaS) for the City’s uniformed and non-uniformed testing programs. This ordinance seeks authority to renew the contract for a SaaS solution for the period July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022.\n \nEssential to the exam development and review process is the need for test item metadata that is complete, detailed, and easily accessible for analysis.  The analysis process is critical to ensuring test items, and the exam overall, are valid, reliable, and eliminate adverse impact in the selection process.  While there are a number of exam item bank management and administration solutions available on the market, the Commission’s review of those products in 2019 revealed Excelsoft offered the most breadth and depth of functionality and features necessary for our detailed analysis of test item performance both upon initial use and over multiple exam administrations.\n \nBecause Commission research and the use of the software for a multi-month trial period (conducted 2019-2020) confirmed Excelsoft is the product currently available that will best meet the needs of the Commission’s testing programs, this ordinance also seeks authority to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code, Chapter 329.\n \nFiscal Impact:  This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $50,000.00 from the General Fund with Excelsoft Technologies, Inc. for exam item bank management and administration software as a service for the City’s uniformed and non-uniformed testing programs.  These funds are available within the Commission’s 2021 General Fund budget. \n \nContract Compliance Number: CC030671, expires 5/20/2022.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Civil Service Commission Executive Director to renew the contract with Excelsoft Technologies, Inc. for exam item bank management and administration software as a service (SaaS) for the City’s uniformed and non-uniformed testing programs; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code, Chapter 329; and to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from the General Fund. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Civil Service Commission has a need for exam item bank management and administration software as a service for its uniformed and non-uniformed testing programs; and,\n \nWHEREAS, based upon informal solicitation of product/service offerings and pricing conducted in late 2019 and the subsequent six month trial use of the Excelsoft product, Excelsoft Technologies, Inc. has been determined to be the most responsive vendor offering the needed services that meet the Commission’s exam item bank management and administration requirements, and has the necessary experience, skills, and infrastructure to provide the needed hosted software solution; and,\n \nWHEREAS, based upon the previously conducted informal solicitation of vendor product/service offerings and pricing, the Commission is seeking authority to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City code, Chapter 329;\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Civil Service Commission to authorize the renewal of this contract; now, therefore:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Civil Service Commission Executive Director is hereby authorized to renew the contract with Excelsoft Technologies, Inc. for test item bank management and administration SaaS.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of up to $50,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 General Fund in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes regarding competitive bidding are hereby waived.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary. \n \nSECTION 5. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
