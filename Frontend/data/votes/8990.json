Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $584,598.83\nOriginal Contract:                                       $775,135.69     (ORD 1768-2023, PO402691, PO402695)\nModification #1:                                                    $1,191,867.05     (ORD 2111-2023, PO411979)\nModification #2:                                              $1,822,179.64     (ORD 2942-2023, PO425120)\nModification #3:                                                 $129,591.25     (ORD 3300-2023, PO TBD)\nModification #4                                             $643,598.83     (current)                     \nTotal                                                               $4,562,372.46\n \n1.2. Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a three-year agreement for fiscal years 2023 - 2025.  Modifications were anticipated and explained in the original legislation under Ordinance 1768-2023.\n \n1.3. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a multi-year contract that will be modified as required to provide construction administration/inspection services for construction projects that bid during the three year (2023-2025) timeframe.  Another procurement process is not required.  \n \n1.4. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between DLZ Ohio, Inc. and the Division of Water based upon the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification. \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nDivision of Water projects include replacement or rehabilitation of water lines that have a high break frequency and valves that are inoperable.  Replacement of these water lines will improve water service, decrease burden on water maintenance operations, and reduce water loss. The Neighborhood Liaison(s) will be contacted and informed of this project during the design phase.  Further community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nDLZ Ohio, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004939 and expires 10/24/2024.  \n                                                         \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  DLZ Ohio, Inc. is ODI certified as an MBE company.  As shown in the Utilization Plan attached to this ordinance, DLZ Ohio, Inc. plans to use one subconsultant on this task, Dynotec, Inc.  The spend with this MBE prime consultant and MBE subconsultant is anticipated to be $634,598.83, or 100.00% for this contract task. \n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nDynotec, Inc.                                             Columbus, OH                                                                               MBE\n \nDLZ Ohio, Inc.’s and Dynotec, Inc.’s certifications were in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for construction administration and inspection of the Elizabeth Avenue Area Water Line Improvements part of this contract, CIP #690236-100132, will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0997-2023, passed by Council on 4/24/23.  CIP # 690236-100132 is not listed as a project anticipated to be funded through this loan program in Ordinance 0997-2023.  Section 2 of the Ordinance allows the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to add projects to the list per departmental need.  \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  A purchase order will need to be established to DLZ Ohio, Inc. for this contract modification.  Public Utilities will need to pay the construction administration and inspection charges directly to DLZ Ohio, Inc. and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nA transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, in the amount of $584,598.83 is needed to fund this contract modification.  The transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in April, 2024.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new Fund. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nFunding for construction administration and inspection of the General Water Construction Projects part of this contract, CIP #690549-100012, will be done through the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  Funding is budgeted and appropriated, and available for this expenditure.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with DLZ Ohio, Inc. for the Construction Administration/Construction Inspection Services 2023-2025 contract; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund; to authorize the appropriation of funds in the Water Reserve Fund and the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund;
