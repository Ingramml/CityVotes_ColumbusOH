It will provide integration for the newly constructed capital improvement projects into the existing PWPCS at the DOSD facilities and provide DOSD staff training, with the goal that the City staff will become self-reliant to handle all PWPCS issues.  New projects must be integrated into the PWPCS to best maintain the operational performance of the treatment facilities. This project also assists City staff in maintaining and upgrading the PWPCS at the  Southerly plant, Jackson Pike plant, Sewer Maintenance Operation Center, Compost facility, and remote telemetry sites including (14) Sanitary Pump Stations, (16) Storm Pump Stations, (8) Biofilter sites, (4) Stream gauge sites, (6) Floodwall Gate Houses, and (30) Flow meter sites. \nThe community planning area for this project is 99 - Citywide. \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $500,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $500,000.00 (Ord. 3370-2022; PO368205)\nModification #1:                                      $500,000.00 (Current)\nTotal:                                                   $1,000,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process to provide engineering services through the completion of construction of this project.  This contract modification is being executed solely to provide funding to continue the next phase of engineering services needed for this project.  A new procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of the modification was determined per the contract rates and job titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each job title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.  \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis contract is essential for maintenance and troubleshooting of the Plant Wide Process Control System (PWPCS) as well as integration of new equipment with the control system.  The project provides emergency response for troubleshooting of the PWPCS which will allow more reliable service from the DOSD facilities and help ensure that the facilities meet environmental permits.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nCDM Smith, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC000180 and expires 10/7/24.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CDM Smith, Inc.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was established with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 8.0% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  The 8% goal must be met with the combined spend of the original contract and all contract modifications.  CDM Smith, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  CDM Smith, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 8%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, CDM Smith, Inc. has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nBrown and Caldwell                                       Columbus, Ohio                                      MAJ\nCAD Concepts Inc.                                       Columbus, Ohio                                       WBE\nEmerging Technology Integrators, Inc.            Columbus, Ohio                                       MBE\n                     \nThe certification of CDM Smith, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract modification will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0997-2023, passed by Council on 4/24/23.  CIP #650348-100005 is not listed as a project anticipated to be funded through this loan program in Ordinance 0997-2023.  Section 2 of the Ordinance allows the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to add projects to the list per departmental need.   \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  A purchase order will need to be established to CDM Smith, Inc. for this contract modification.  Public Utilities will need to pay the construction administration and inspection charges directly to CDM Smith, Inc. and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund, Fund 6124, in the amount of $500,000.00 is needed to fund this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the OWDA to reimburse the Sanitary Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in April, 2024.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with CDM Smith, Inc., for the Waste Water Treatment Facilities System Instrumentation and Control Integration and Programming project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $500,000.00 from the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund for the contract.
