    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe City has engaged in discussions with the business owner about their business practices, safety measures, and employee procedures, including involvement from the Columbus Division of Police to provide recommendations for security uplifts at the establishment.  These discussions have been memorialized into a nuisance abatement agreement between the City and the business owner, and includes requirements for security uplifts (cameras, lighting, hours of operation), employee training, and specific prohibitions on activity at the establishment.  The nuisance abatement agreement between the parties was reached in lieu of pursuing the outstanding objection, and the City reserves the right to object to their liquor license in the future or to bring the establishment into Franklin County Environmental Court should they not comply.  The Division of Liquor Control requested that the City therefore withdraw this objection via resolution.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This establishment has engaged in liquor sales on a temporary basis via the goodwill of the City and the Division of Liquor Control, but it does not yet have a valid 2024 liquor permit until the objection is withdrawn.  Now that the agreements are memorialized, and to facilitate the full, legal operation of liquor sales by business as soon as possible, the City requests passage of an emergency resolution.\n \n \nTitle\n \n \nTo withdraw the objection to the renewal of liquor permit number 84189940540 held by Speedway LLC, doing business as Speedway 9751, located at 1165 S.
