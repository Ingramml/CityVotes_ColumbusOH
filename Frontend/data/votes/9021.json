    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to enter into contract with Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care and Lindsay Automotive to provide car repair services for Project Taillight, a public safety and crime prevention program.  This ordinance also allows for the appropriation and expenditure of $500,000 to continue the expansion of Project Taillight.\n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention program offers low-income residents access to free vehicle repairs. These repairs keep drivers, passengers and pedestrians safer on the roads and prevent low-income residents from receiving tickets for safety code violations. Project Taillight started as a two-year, grant funded pilot and is now a program fully funded by the City of Columbus. City Council is appropriating $500,000 to continue and expand the program to keep these automobiles operational and allow residents to maintain their transportation.\n \n \nPROCUREMENT\n \nIn accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code, the Columbus City Attorney’s Office solicited Best Value Procurement bids for auto repair services through the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from November 16th through December 21st, 2023 (solicitation #BVP111623). The city attorney sought to identify up to five (5) repair partners located in high-need neighborhoods across Columbus. However, only two (2) bids were received. These proposals were evaluated and scored by the review committee using the rubric outlined in solicitation #BVP111623. \n \nMr. Transmission/Milex Complete’s application was deemed responsive. The committee determined that this proposal was detailed and demonstrated a full understanding of the scope of work and met all partner requirements. The other application was reviewed and deemed unresponsive as the application was incomplete and provided no detail on how contract work would be completed. The committee recommends entering into contract with Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care. \n \nThe committee also contends that it is critical to offer participants at least one additional location for repairs to maintain access to program services. Lindsay Automotive served as a repair partner through the first two years of the Project Taillight pilot and has demonstrated ability in achieving program repairs in a manner that meets fiscal requirements and promotes equitable and respectful service. Lindsay is committed to this public service effort but was unable to submit a bid due to a transition in staff. The committee recommends waiving bid and entering into contract with Lindsay Automotive, Inc. for repair services. \n \nBoth contracts will be for one (1) year with twelve (12) month renewal options. For each year of the contract, funding is contingent on availability within the budget, mutual agreement between the parties, approval of Columbus City Council and certification of funds by the Columbus City Auditor.\n \nINDEFINITE QUANTITY SERVICE CONTRACT JUSTIFICATION: The city attorney made a conscious decision to work with multiple service vendors for the Project Taillight program. Working through multiple locations increases access for program participants and allows the city to invest in multiple business partners serving our diverse resident population. Each approved partner contractually commits to the same labor rate and parts discount (see rates in attached BVP). Because eligible participants are referred to the repair shop that is most convenient for them, the project team is unable to determine how many vehicles will be serviced through each vendor location. Therefore, individual contracts will not be assigned budget caps. Rather, purchase agreements will be set up for each Project Taillight vendor in our system that will draw from a single $460,000 encumbrance. The Columbus City Attorney’s Office will monitor the Project Taillight account and stop referring participants for services when available funds are no longer sufficient to cover repairs.\n \nNote: The review committee will set up a meeting with the vendors who expressed interest in becoming Project Taillight partners but did not submit proposals to gain a clear understanding of the barriers presented in the solicitation/BVP. The team will review this feedback and modify partner requirements (if needed) then reopen the solicitation. Should the new bid influence changes to vendor service contracts for existing Project Taillight partners (such as an adjustment to the labor rate or timeframe for repair), a contract modification will be submitted for Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto and Lindsay Automotive to ensure equity across vendors.\n \nVENDOR:\n§                     Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care | CC-033102 | cert exp 3/8/2025\n§                     Lindsay Automotive Inc. vendor | CC004376 | cert exp 8/31/2024\n \nThese companies do not hold Minority Business Enterprise of Women Business Enterprise status.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Total appropriation is $500,000.00 and is available within the Public Safety Initiative subfund.    \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to immediately provide the funds necessary to continue and expand the Project Taillight pilot and provide residents with needed repairs to their vehicles, without interruption.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Attorney to enter into two contracts with Lindsay Automotive, Inc and Mr. Transmission/Milex Complete Auto Care for the purpose of supporting and expanding the Project Taillight public safety and crime prevention program; to waive competitive bidding for the Lindsay Automotive, Inc. contract; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $500,000.00 within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
