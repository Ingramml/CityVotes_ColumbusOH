    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract modification to add funding for the current year with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Wastewater Treatment Facilities (WWTF)-General Program #5 project, CIP #650360-100003, in an amount up to $1,200,000.00. \n \nOverall Engineering Consultant Services (OEC) are necessary to provide technical and engineering assistance to the City and its design professionals in planning and coordination of the work.   The OEC services are separated into several tasks, as follows:\n \n                     Task 1 - Planning Services\n                     Task 2 - Design Services\n                     Task 3 - Construction Related Services\n                     Task 4 - Commissioning and Start-up Services\n                     Task 5 - General and Additional Services\n                     Task 6 - Project Management\n \nThe City will request a task order from the consultant as necessary work is identified.  The task order submitted will include a detailed scope of work, direct and indirect costs, task schedule, estimated hours, personnel categories required with labor rates, and reimbursable expenses.  After negotiation and upon acceptance by the city, the consultant shall commence work.  The Engineer shall provide such professional engineering services as may be necessary to accomplish the work required to be performed and shall at the firm’s cost, furnish all necessary competent personnel, equipment, and materials to perform the work.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,200,000.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                 $800,000.00                (Ord. 0601-2023 PO382045)\nMod #1 Amount:                                                                      $1,200,000.00        (Current)\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):               $2,000,000.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was originally planned as a 3-year effort with annual funding modifications because it includes tasks which stretch across several funding years, and because the nature of the work requires the firm to develop a deep and detailed understanding of our plants and how we operate them.  A new procurement effort is not required to add funding.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Black & Veatch Corporation and the Division of Water based upon the contract rates and titles established in the original contract and an estimate of the number of hours needed for each title for the tasks to be assigned to the contract modification.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project provides many metrics on various environmental factors that are noted in the work to be performed.  The information provided assists and guides the City in decision making on environmental issues.  These decisions have a direct impact on the capital improvement program budget amounts and scheduling to address the environmental needs.  No community outreach is considered for this project\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nBlack & Veatch Corporation’s contract compliance number is CC008038 and expires 8/22/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Black & Veatch Corporation.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 23.0% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the proposer submitted with their response, a goal of 23.0% has been established for this contract. Black & Veatch Corporation is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Black & Veatch Corporation anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of sub-consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 23%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Black & Veatch Corporation has proposed the following nine subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nDynotec, Inc                                                                                            Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nBrown and Caldwell                                                            Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nBurgess & Niple                                                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nDLZ                                                                                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nMODIFI Design dba Hydrous                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nGeosyntec                                                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                             Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\nColdwater                                                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nStantec                                                                                Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\n \nThe certification of Black & Veatch Corporation and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0997-2023, passed by Council on 4/24/23.  CIP # 650360-100003 is not listed as a project anticipated to be funded through this loan program in Ordinance 0997-2023.  Section 2 of the Ordinance allows the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to add projects to the list per departmental need.  \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  A purchase order will need to be established to Black & Veatch Corporation for this contract modification.  Public Utilities will need to pay the contract charges directly to Black & Veatch Corporation and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.   \n \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Loan Fund, Fund 6124, in the amount of $1,200,000.00 is needed to fund construction for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the OWDA to reimburse the Sanitary Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in March, 2024.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract modification with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Waste Water Treatment Facilities-General Program #5 project;
