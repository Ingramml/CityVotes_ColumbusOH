    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with BLD Services, LLC, for public sanitary sewers for the Lateral Lining - Blueprint North Linden 1, Hudson McGuffey project, CIP #650872-141004, in an amount up to $12,789,930.50; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction administration and inspection services in an amount up to $2,000.00 for a total expenditure of $12,791,930.50. \n \nThis project involves the lining of sanitary laterals of 1,245 homes, approximately 70,000 linear feet, via “trenchless” methods using curing-in-place pipe (CIPP) technology, to prevent excess stormwater from entering the City's sanitary sewer system.  Trenchless pipe lining uses existing pipes to guide new and improved pipes into the sewage system.  Sewer lateral lining repair uses special sewage pipes that are flexible and able to fit inside existing pipes.  Once the new pipes have been pulled through, they are inflated and effectively replace the old pipes.\n \nNo future phases are expected at this time. This project is a Consent Order project. A Consent order is a negotiated agreement entered as a court order that is enforceable by the court. In 2005, the City of Columbus entered its Wet Weather Management Plan to the Ohio EPA to bring the City in compliance with its consent orders regarding the City’s sewer overflows. This project is an improvement identified in the Integrated Plan and the 2015 Wet Weather Management Plan Update Report.  The project is needed to mitigate water in basement events and sanitary sewer overflows to the goal of a 10 year Level of Service (LOS).\n  \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 40, North Linden.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 750 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $12,789,930.50, including a 20% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                       $12,789,930.50\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                        $0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                                  $2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                               $12,791,930.50\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe project is needed to mitigate water in basement events and sanitary sewer overflows to the goal of a 10 year Level of Service (LOS).  Public meetings were conducted to solicit public input regarding the project, and descriptions of the work associated with this project were included on the City of Columbus website.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Public Sanitary Sewers for Lateral Lining - Blueprint North Linden 1, Hudson McGuffey project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 10/5/23 through 11/8/23.  Two bids were received for the project and were opened on 11/8/23.  The following companies submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                           Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\n1.

BLD Services, LLC.                         $12,789,930.50                             CC019505                        MAJ\n \nPerformance Pipelining, Inc.’s bid was deemed non-responsive for failing to meet the assigned City MBE/WBE goal and then not scoring 80 or more points on their Good Faith Effort.  BLD Services, LLC’s bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $12,789,930.50.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nBLD Services, LLC’s contract compliance number is CC019505 and expires 11/3/25.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against BLD Services, LLC. \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 20% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 20% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nBLD Services, LLC listed the following companies as subcontractors for this project:\n \nCompany Name                                                City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nUnderground Eyes II, LLC                            Columbus, Ohio                                          WBE\nJLD Construction Services, LLC.                   Columbus, Ohio                                          MBE\n \nThe certification of BLD Services, LLC. and of the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nBLD Services, Llc and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2767-2023, passed by Council on 10/30/23.  The loan is expected to be approved in March, 2024. \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, in the amount of $12,789,930.50 is needed to fund construction for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the Ohio EPA to reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  \n \nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with BLD Services, LLC, for the Lateral Lining - Blueprint North Linden 1, Hudson McGuffey project;
