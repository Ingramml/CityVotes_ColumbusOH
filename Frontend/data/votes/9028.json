    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Brown and Caldwell for professional design services for the SWWTP Digester Process Expansion Phase II project, CIP #650353-100006, in an amount up to $3,011,106.84. \n \nThe original contract was for Preliminary Design Services. The preliminary design phase of the contract included a condition assessment of the Acid Phase Digesters (APDs); a phosphorous recovery alternatives evaluation; a fats, oils, and grease (FOG) receiving station evaluation; an organics receiving feasibility evaluation; a comprehensive biogas reuse evaluation; a digestion process intensification and mass balance evaluation; and a site layout investigation. Each of these investigations and evaluations culminated in the production of a Detailed Design Memorandum (DDM) that will drive the ultimate design of this project. \nThis contract modification is to provide funding for Detailed Design Services which will provide detailed design based on the findings in the DDM, funding for assistance with the development of bid documents, and funding for bidding assistance. This phase of the project also provides funding for two pilot studies (microaeration and Class B equivalency) to help with biogas quality and digestion capacity. \nA future modification is anticipated to provide services during construction to provide engineering assistance throughout the construction phase of this project. \nThe community planning area for this project is 99 - Citywide. \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $3,011,106.84\nOriginal Contract Amount:                       $2,504,192.85 (Ord. 1616-2021; PO285966)\nModification #1:                                      $3,011,106.84 (Current)\nModification #2:                                      $2,364,000.00 (Future estimate) \nTotal:                                                     $7,879,299.69\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process to provide engineering services through the completion of construction of this project.  This contract modification is being executed solely to provide funding to continue the next phase of engineering services needed for this project.  A new procurement process is not required.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this modification was determined by negotiations between Brown and Caldwell and Department of Public Utilities project staff based upon the existing contract labor titles, maximum labor rates, allowable contract expenses, and the time estimated to be needed to perform assigned tasks. \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will provide the SWWTP digestion system with a reliable mixing system through the addition of variable frequency drives on the mixing pumps. The current digestion mixing system imparts too much energy into the system and causes rapid rise (foaming) events that pour out onto the ground. In addition, this project will rehabilitate the Acid Phase Digesters to improve the reliability of the system.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nBrown and Caldwell’s contract compliance number is CC010815 and expires 10/10/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Brown and Caldwell\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Brown and Caldwell is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Brown and Caldwell anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of sub-consultants. The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 17.4%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Brown and Caldwell has proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nDynotec, Inc.                                                 Columbus, Ohio                                      MBE\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.          Columbus, Ohio                                      MBE\nRegency Construction Services, Inc.                Columbus, Ohio                                     WBE\n                     \n The certification of Brown and Caldwell and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract modification will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0997-2023, passed by Council on 4/24/23.  This project is not listed as a project anticipated to be funded through this loan program in Ordinance 0997-2023.  Section 2 of the Ordinance allows the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to add projects to the list per departmental need.  The loan is expected to be approved in April, 2024. \n \nThe OWDA Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  A purchase order will need to be established to Brown and Caldwell for this contract.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices received for the engineering services directly to Brown and Caldwell and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.\n \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund, Fund 6124, in the amount of $3,011,106.84 is needed to fund this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the OWDA to reimburse the Sanitary Reserve Fund.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with Brown and Caldwell for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Digester Process Expansion Phase Two project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $3,011,106.84 from the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund to pay for the contract.
