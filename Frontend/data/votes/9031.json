    "title": "To amend Title 11, Chapter 1150 Floodplain Management, of the Columbus City Codes to require new public streets within the 100-year floodplain to be at the Base Flood Elevation or higher.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance amends Title 11, Chapter 1150 Floodplain Management, Section 1150.23 Standards and requirements for activities, development and uses in the floodway fringe of the Columbus City Codes. \n \nThe proposed Code change will require new public streets within the 100-year floodplain to be at the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) or higher.\n \nCurrently, Columbus City Code requires new public streets to be at Flood Protection Elevation (FPE), which is defined as one and a half feet above the BFE. Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is defined as the projected water surface level, measured from mean sea level, at any given point in a base flood. To paraphrase in simpler terms, BFE is the 100-year floodplain elevation.\n \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) standards for Communities to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) have no requirements for the elevations of streets in the 100-year Floodplain. The current new public street elevation requirement in City Code is a local community “higher standard”, not mandated by federal FEMA NFIP standards.\n \nNotably, the requirement does not apply to existing public streets within the floodplain, allowing new public streets in the developed areas to meet the elevation already established.   \n \nThe current requirement may result in significant technical and financial hardship for developments within Columbus without a justifiable public benefit.\n \nMost local communities in Central Ohio either have no new street elevation within the floodplain requirements, or require them to be at the BFE level. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nA reduction in technical and financial hardship for developments within Columbus. \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Title 11, Chapter 1150 Floodplain Management, of the Columbus City Codes to require new public streets within the 100-year floodplain to be at the Base Flood Elevation or higher.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend Title 11, Chapter 1150 Floodplain Management, of the Columbus City Codes; and\n \nWHEREAS, existing requirements in City Code impose a standard on new street development that exceeds those required by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) standards and most local communities in Central Ohio; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend City Code Section 1150.23 to require new public streets within the 100-year floodplain to be at the Base Flood Elevation or higher; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Utilities, to amend Section 1150.23 of Columbus City Codes; now, therefore \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That Section 1150.23 is hereby amended as follows: \nSEE ATTACHMENT - ORD 0675-2024 Public Streets in Floodway Fringe City Code Change.\n \nSECTION 2. That existing Section 1150.23 is hereby repealed.\nSECTION 3. That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
