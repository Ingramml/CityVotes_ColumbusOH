    "description": "Title\n \nTo Honor and Recognize April 3, 2024 as Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian Women’s Equal Pay Day  \n \n \nBody\n \n \nWHEREAS, The wage gap plays a large role in hindering women’s economic agency and autonomy. Asian American, Native Hawaiin, and Pacific Islander women workers on average made 80 cents for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts in 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander women are overrepresented in frontline and low-wage positions, especially in the retail, restaurant, and personal care industry; unequal pay exacerbates the barriers they face in their everyday lives, including the ability to provide and care for themselves, their children, and extended family members; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus is home to many AANHPI women and disaggregated data reveals that many women experience much larger wage gaps, particularly Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander women. For example, Nepalese women earn only 51 cents for every dollar; and\n \nWHEREAS, leaders like the Ohio State University professor Dr. Joyce Chen continue to push for equitable workplace practices through advanced research, community advocacy, and even self-advocacy ; and\n \nWHEREAS, Dr. Chen has peer reviewed academic publications on the gender pay gap among tenure track faculty at tOSU and faculty in economics at large public universities, contributing to the advancement of her local Columbus community ; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is imperative to recognize the diversity within the Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian subgroups to provide an accurate snapshot of the data in pushing forward change and equity that the CIty of Columbus believes in; and\n \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: does hereby declare April 3, 2024 as Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian Women’s Equal Pay Day.",
