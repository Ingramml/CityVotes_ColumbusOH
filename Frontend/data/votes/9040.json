    "description": "...Title\nTo Proclaim April as Parkinson’s Awareness Month and Recognize the Parkinson’s Foundation’s Moving Day\n \n...Body\nWhereas, Parkison’s Disease is a chronic, progressive neurological disease and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States; and\n \nWhereas, Parkinson’s Disease is estimated to affect approximately one million people in the United States with 60,000 new diagnoses each year and the prevalence will more than double by 2040; and\n \nWhereas, research suggests the cause of Parkinson’s Disease is a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the exact cause and progression of the disease is still unknown; and\n \nWhereas, there is no objective test for Parkinson’s Disease, and there is no cure; and\n \nWhereas, the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease vary from person to person and can include tremors, slowness of movement and rigidity, difficulty with balance, swallowing, chewing and speaking, cognitive impairment and dementia, mood disorder, and a variety of other non-motor symptoms; and \n \nWhereas, volunteers, researchers, caregivers, and medical professionals are working to improve the quality of life of persons living with Parkinson’s Disease and their families; and\n \nWhereas, increased research, education, and community support services such as those provided by the Parkinson’s Foundation and other organizations are needed to find more effective treatments and to provide access to quality care to those living with the disease today; and \n \nWhereas, the Parkinson’s Foundation is a national organization with a prominent chapter in Columbus that helps individuals who have been diagnosed, especially recently, with Parkinson’s Disease; and\n \nWhereas, the Foundation continues to work diligently to help support researchers and those with Parkinson’s Disease and encourage awareness across the population; and\nWhereas, on Sunday, April 28, 2024 the Parkinson’s Foundation will be hosting the 12th Annual Moving Day Columbus, a fundraising event and walk for Parkinson’s at Wolfe Park; Now, Therefore\n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: \n \nThat this Council does hereby proclaim April 2024 as Parkinson’s Awareness Month and commends the Parkinson’s Foundation’s work and highlights their annual Moving Day on April 28, 2024",
