The City received two (2) proposals.  A committee of three (3) members evaluated and scored the proposals.  The proposal submitted by USI Insurance Services, LLC received the highest total point score and scored significantly higher in both the ability and pricing categories. The committee recommended USI Insurance Services, LLC as the responder best qualified to provide insurance brokerage and risk management services to the City. \n \nThe City’s current insurance brokerage and risk engineering services contract expires on April 30, 2024. The City desires to establish a five (5) year contractual relationship with USI Insurance Services, LLC as the City’s insurance broker by a contract with an initial one-year term commencing May 1, 2024 and four (4) additional consecutive automatic one-year renewals. Each renewal term being subject to the appropriation of funds by City Council and the certification of funds availability by the City Auditor. The insurance brokerage and risk engineering service fee for the initial one-year term and first renewal term will be $52,000.00. Funds for the initial term are budgeted and available within the Finance and Management 2024 General Revenue Budget.  \n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management to award and enter into a contract with USI Insurance Services, LLC for an initial one-year term commencing May 1, 2024 and terminating April 30, 2025 with four (4) additional consecutive automatic one-year renewals, each renewal term being subject to the appropriation of funds by City Council and the certification of funds availability by the City Auditor. The contract will contain a provision stipulating that the brokerage and risk engineering fee is not earned until the City’s annually selected insurance coverage is underwritten and in effect. Therefore, no funds for the contract are due until the City selects its annual insurance coverage, the broker places the policies, and those policies are in effect. In June, a separate ordinance will be submitted requesting funds for payment of both the brokerage and risk engineering fee and the cost of annual premiums for the City's 2024-2025 insurance term. \n \nThe Contract Compliance Number for USI Insurance Services, LLC is 13-3771734. \n \nFiscal Impact:  The funding for this contract is budgeted and the funds are available within the Department of Finance and Management 2024 General Fund Budget. The expenditure of funds for payment of the brokerage and risk services fee will be requested in a separate ordinance along with the funds for payment of the premiums associated with the insurance coverage acquired to protect City assets for the August 1, 2024 through July 31, 2025 insurance year.   \n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the immediate award of RFQ026631 and a contract to USI Insurance Services, LLC so that insurance brokerage services may continue uninterrupted to meet timelines necessary to ensure the underwriting of policies to protect the City’s assets for the 2024-2025 insurance year.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to award a contract and execute those documents necessary to enter into an insurance brokerage and risk engineering services contract with USI Insurance Services, LLC for an initial term of one (1) year and four (4) consecutive one (1) year automatic renewal terms, with the initial contract term commencing May 1, 2024 and terminating  April 30, 2025, and to declare an emergency.
