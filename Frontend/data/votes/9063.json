    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Columbus Housing Initiatives - Wheatland Avenue Improvements project.\nOrdinance 1846-2021 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. for the Columbus Housing Initiatives - Wheatland Avenue Improvements project.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional engineering and related services necessary to produce construction plans and associated deliverables for improvements to North Wheatland Avenue from Broad Street to Glenview Boulevard. Improvements will generally consist of converting the roadway to two-way traffic and needed widening to provide for a parking lane on the west side. Improvements will consist of new curbs, sidewalks, storm sewer, electric distribution relocation, and street lighting.  This ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $35,000.00.\nThis project was awarded funds from the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement Program which provides annual grants on a formula basis to entitled cities and counties to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment, and by expanding economic opportunities, principally for low- and moderate-income persons.  The amount needed for this modification is included in the City’s current Action Plan for the Community Development Block Grant Wheatland Avenue Street Improvements Design Activity and Wheatland Farm Complex Project.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $35,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $550,000.00     (PO284719, Ord. 1846-2021)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $35,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $585,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary due to unforeseen circumstances found during the detailed design of the transmission and distribution circuits. It was determined a stringing summary will be needed for the construction of the facilities by a qualified contractor. This requirement was not known at the time of scoping the project nor negotiating the contract.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nWoolpert, Inc. has knowledge and experience with this specific design, bidding the work out would add more costs and time to the completion.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Woolpert, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Woolpert, Inc. is CC001040 and expires 04/17/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nA reimbursable grant in the Community Development Act Fund, Fund 2248, provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is available for this project. Funds will need to be appropriated.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested because all CDBG funds must be spent and paid by mid-October to meet the HUD timeliness test; if the timeline test fails, the City is subject to a reduction in funding for future years; emergency passage will ensure the maximum amount of time to complete the work.                     \n \nTitle\nTo appropriate funds within the Community Development Act Fund; to authorize the Interim Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Woolpert, Inc. for the Columbus Housing Initiatives - Wheatland Avenue Improvements project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $35,000.00 from the Community Development Act Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency.  ($35,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
