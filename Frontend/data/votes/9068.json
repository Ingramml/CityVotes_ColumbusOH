    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resource (ODNR) for the Urban Forestry Grant Program. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of the grant in the amount of $500,000.00.\n \nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) solicited competitive proposals for the Urban Forestry grant program and the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department submitted the grant application in December 2023. This Urban Forestry grant is a reimbursable grant that supports long-term growth and development of local urban and community forest programs. A requirement of the program is a focus on disadvantaged communities defined by The Council on Environmental Quality’s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST).  \n \nThe goals of the Urban Forestry Grant Program align with the City’s Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP). ODNR awarded $500,000.00 to the City of Columbus Recreation and Parks Department for tree plantings within the project area. The City intends to utilize these grant funds to plant approximately 1,250 large-class street trees.  The plantings will directly support the UFMP goal of investing in equitable canopy across all neighborhoods by 2030, focusing on neighborhoods with low tree canopy and high social equity needs. The census tracts identified for planting through the Climate and Economic Justice screening tool are also ranked as either high or very high priorities in the UFMP Social Equity Needs Index, meaning these tracts have low tree canopy and high need for new trees.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Department of Natural Resources\n2045 Morse Road, Building H-1\nColumbus, Ohio 43229                                                 \nCarrie Morrow, (614) 265-6509\nContract Compliance Number: 005089\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: N/A (State of Ohio Agency)\n \nBenefits to the Public: Trees provide tangible benefits to Columbus residents. As the 15th largest city in the nation, Columbus is home to over 900,000 people. Columbus had the 8th most intense urban heat island effect of major US cities, impacting health, energy use, and water quality. The recently published Columbus Climate Action Plan recommends planting trees as a solution. Street trees are the workhorses as they clean our air, reduce heat, and absorb stormwater. In an Ohio summer, trees provide the shade that makes walking outside bearable. Trees should be equitably distributed across the City so all residents benefit.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Hundreds of stakeholders helped create the Urban Forestry Master Plan. Industry experts, universities, nonprofits, developers, community leaders, city staff, regional partners, landscape architects, and many others served on two stakeholder groups consisting of a Project Team of about 30 members and an Advisory Group of about 100 members. All members are listed in the Acknowledgments section of the UFMP and on the UFMP website The UFMP website is located at www.columbusufmp.org. These groups met periodically throughout the course of the plan’s creation to provide input. The public was also engaged through an online survey, an open house, small-group presentations, and interviews.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the City’s natural resources and overall environmental health for current and future generations. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $500,000.00 in grant funds in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283. Future legislation will be prepared to expend these funds once the project is ready to move forward.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into a grant agreement with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) for the Urban Forestry Grant Program and to accept a grant in the amount of $500,000.00; and to authorize the appropriation of $500,000.00 in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.
