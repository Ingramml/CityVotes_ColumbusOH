    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the expenditure of $368,850.95 within the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration (LHRD) Program Grant (Lead-19 Grant) (G441900); requests that Columbus City Council waive the provisions in Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14, 329.18, and 329.09 pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15; and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to approve purchase orders with contractors for the Lead Safe Columbus Program that may be greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement with a homeowner or purchase order with a contractor to carry out the purpose of the grant program, all without having to return to City Council for each project for the Lead Safe Columbus Program.\n \nThe Department of Development received the Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration (LHRD) Program Grant (Lead-19 Grant) from the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 2019 and this grant provides funding for the Lead Safe Columbus Program.  The grant was authorized via ordinance 2715-2019 as a reimbursable grant in an amount up to $5,600,000.00.  \n \nThe funds to be expended under this legislation are funds that have been cancelled from grant agreements/purchase orders for projects already completed under the Lead Safe Columbus Program.  Since appropriation has been received under Ordinance 2715-2019, only approval to expend these cancelled funds is needed.  \n \nIn order to effectively and efficiently manage these remaining funds, the grant, the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program, and to expend the funds before the grant ends June 1, 2024, this legislation requests the waiver of the provisions in Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14, 329.18, and 329.09, pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15, and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to approve purchase orders with contractors that may be greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement with a homeowner and purchase order with a contractor to carry out the purpose of the Lead Safe Columbus Grant Program without having to return to City Council for each project.\n \nColumbus City Codes (CCC) Section 111.14 states, that “All programs which award loans or grants of more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) must submit legislation for approval to city council”;  CCC 329.18 states, “No contract greater than $50,000.00 awarded under this section shall be effective until approved by ordinance of city council”; and CCC 329.09 states, “After agreeing upon the terms of a modification, the city agency shall submit legislation to city council requesting approval of the modification….”  Under this ordinance, these provisions would be waived.  \n \nThe funds will allow the Lead Safe Columbus Program to continue to provide property owners with grants for lead safe, healthier, affordable housing for families with low and moderate income under HUD guidelines. The program provides lead abatement and healthy homes activities in accordance with HUD guidelines, including but not limited to, lead paint level testing, risk assessments, lead hazard control and healthy homes interventions and clearance tests as well as outreach, education and training.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the immediate approval the expenditure of funds and authorizations for the Director of the Department of Development so the funds can be expended before the expiration of the grant, June 1, 2024, as a delay may result in funds being returned to HUD and less homes abated of lead.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Lead-19 Grant G441900.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the expenditure of $368,850.95 within the Lead Hazard Control Reduction Grant (Lead-19) in the General Government Grant Fund; to waive the provisions in Columbus City Codes Sections 111.14, 329.18, and 329.09 pursuant to Columbus City Codes Section 329.15; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development, for the Lead Safe Columbus Program, to enter into grant agreements with homeowners if the grant amount is greater than $5,000.00, to approve purchase orders with contractors that may be greater than $50,000.00, and to modify a grant agreement with a homeowner or purchase order with a contractor to carry out the purpose of the grant program, all without having to return to City Council for each project for the Lead Safe Columbus Program; and to declare an emergency.
