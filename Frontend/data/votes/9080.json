    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  Ordinance 1574-2021, approved by Columbus City Council on June 9, 2021, authorized the sale of three Land Bank parcels located on Camden Avenue to Eboni Eiland and Martha Kellem, a builder and the intended homeowner.  After the sale, the parties failed to complete the project.  Since the intended homeowner’s name is on the deed, the builder cannot build the project (single family home) for another homeowner. The Land Bank Program now seeks to repurchase the property for the amount the properties were sold, thereby resolving the issue. This legislation will authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute any and all documents that are necessary to acquire the parcels located at 1055 Camden Ave (010-027263), 0000 Camden Ave (010-006751), and 0000 Camden Ave (010-053503) for $39,194, plus customary closing costs, a total not to exceed $42,500.00. \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Land Management Fund, fund 2206.\nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Emergency action is requested so the City can schedule closing within a period agreed to by the parties.  \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development, or his designee, to acquire three properties on Camden Avenue for the City’s Land Reutilization Program from Eboni Eiland and Martha Kellem; to execute any and all documents, as approved by the City Attorney, necessary for conveyance of title and related services; to authorize the appropriation of $42,500.00; to authorize an expenditure not to exceed $42,500.00 from the Land Management Fund; and to declare an emergency.
