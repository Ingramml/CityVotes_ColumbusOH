    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with United Way of Central Ohio, Inc. for Year 2 of the department’s Elevate! 2.0 program. The term of the grant shall be for a 12- month period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. The total amount awarded is $100,000.00.\n                     \nColumbus, renowned as America's Opportunity City, remains a beacon of potential and hope for its residents. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the population faces challenges stemming from personal, societal, structural, and economic factors, which impede their full participation in the city's myriad opportunities. Acknowledging the complexity of these challenges, the City is committed to implementing a comprehensive solution and is responsible for driving transformative changes to establish equitable opportunities for all residents.\n \nThe Elevate! Initiative plays a pivotal role in effecting this transformative change. This initiative allocates funding to support 112 distinct non-profit organizations categorized into two programs, denoted as 1.0 and 2.0, collectively addressing 16 of the 21 aspirations outlined in The Mayor’s Opportunity Rising. Through various means, the Elevate! Initiative promotes and provides opportunities for collaboration, learning, and resource-sharing among member agencies, ensuring that every community member they serve can access the services needed based upon their unique circumstance.\n \nThe Elevate! 2.0 NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability) was made available to local not-for-profit organizations from September 12, 2022, to October 3, 2022. The Department received 142 applications, requesting a total funding of $14,050,000.00, which were reviewed by a 24-member team. Sixty-four programs were selected for funding in 2023, marking the inaugural year of the three-year Elevate! 2.0 program. Fifty-nine community agencies are listed in a separate ordinance, funding for this agency is within this ordinance, and the remaining awarded agencies will have legislation put forth at a later date. The Grant Agreements for the second year will be distinct from the first year, although the overarching purpose remains consistent. Awards anticipate renewal in FY2025, contingent on funding availability and program performance as per agreements with each agency.\n \nFunding will be advanced on a predetermined schedule. The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order. Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the grant agreement. Additionally, these programs/grant agreements may include reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of the programs which expenditure is hereby deemed to be a valid public purpose in that such purchase will address the immediate needs of program participants.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for these expenditures is allocated from the Emergency Human Services Fund budget, in an amount up to $100,000.00 (Fund 2231). This legislation is contingent upon the passage of Ordinance 0655-2024\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: The vendor number is 006101 and the expiration date is 3/7/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with United way of Central Ohio, Inc. in an amount up to $100,000.00 for Year 2 of the department’s Elevate! 2.0 program; to authorize the provision of services for a 12 month period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024; to authorize the payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of programs included in the grant agreements; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; to authorize the expenditure of up to $100,000.00 from the Emergency Human Services Fund.
