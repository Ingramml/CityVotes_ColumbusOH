    "description": "Explanation\n \n“Kenzi” a canine that has been in service with the Division of Police’s Canine Unit for nine years needs to be taken out of service.\n \n“Kenzi” is an 11 year old canine and his handler is retiring from the Division of Police after thirty-four years of service.  “Kenzi” has an obstinate temperament.  Re-training him with another handler is unadvisable and economically impractical due to his age and his surpassed service life to the Division of Police  Due to these facts it is in the best interest of “Kenzi” and the Division to take him out of service and retire him.  Retiring “Kenzi” would keep the Division from paying the additional cost for food and medical expenses with no guarantee that he would be able to perform necessary duties.  \n \nIt is recommended that “Kenzi” be retired and to permit his handler, Officer John D. Dollmatch #1497, to assume custody and care of “Kenzi” and purchase him from the Division of Police for the sum of $1.00 as authorized by ORC 9.62, (C).  Officer John D. Dollmatch #1497 has agreed to accept “Kenzi”. \n \nAdditionally, the Division of Police Legal Bureau has developed a general release document that relinquishes the City of Columbus from any liability as it relates to the post retirement care and control of “Kenzi”, and assigns that liability to Officer John D. Dollmatch #1497.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\n \nAt this time, there are plans to replace this canine with a new canine through the General Fund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to sell to Officer John D. Dollmatch, for the sum of $1.00, a police canine with the registered name of “Kenzi” which has no further value to the Division of Police and to waive the provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 relating to the sale of City-owned personal property. ($1.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, “Kenzi” has been a Canine Unit canine with the Division of Police for nine years; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is recommended “Kenzi” be retired due to his handler’s retirement; and \n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police to authorize the purchase of this canine by Officer John D. Dollmatch #1497 for the sum of $1.00; Now, Therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized and directed to sell the police canine with the registered name of “Kenzi” to Officer John D. Dollmatch #1497 for the sum of $1.00.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Council of the City of Columbus finds it is in the best interests of the City that the provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 relating to the sale of City-owned personal property, be and are hereby waived to permit the sale of this specific canine to Officer John D. Dollmatch #1497.\n \nSECTION 3. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
