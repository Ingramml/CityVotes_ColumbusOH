    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification to start detailed engineering design services with ms consultants, inc. for the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project, CIP #690502-100001, in an amount up to $901,234.82.  \n \nThis modification is to begin detailed design work including survey, soil borings, and base mapping for the design of water transmission mains that will be constructed in conjunction with the City’s future fourth water plant. The transmission mains will extend from the fourth water plant located at 5992 Home Road, Delaware, Ohio, to a strategic connection point in the City’s existing water distribution system, specifically the Cleveland/Henderson pressure district.  \n \nThe initial contract funding was for preliminary design services (Phase 1 of the contract).  Modification #1 added preliminary design services for new Scioto River/Griggs Reservoir crossing(s) into the Cleveland/Henderson pressure districts and associated transmission main alignment(s) to connect the Fourth Water Plant transmission mains.  The existing waterlines crossing the Scioto River do not have the capacity to convey flows from the future Fourth Water Plant, based on projected plant capacity.  This current Modification (Modification #2) is needed in order to maintain the project’s schedule to have at least one transmission main constructed by 12/31/28 by beginning on the first stages of Detailed Design for the chosen alignment. These early-stage services are only for Survey, Base Mapping, and Geotechnical work.  \n \nThere are two additional planned contract modifications.  One contract modification will be for Phase 2 (remainder of detailed design services).  The final planned contract modification will be for Phase 3 (engineering services during construction).\n \nThe majority of the transmission main will be located outside the City of Columbus.  The portion within the City of Columbus will be located within the Hayden Run Planning Area (30) and the Far Northwest Planning Area (31).  The Citywide Planning Area (99) will be used for the accounting template due to the project covering multiple areas.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE  \nThe duration of Phase 1 (Preliminary Design Services) is still expected to take 18 months and end in mid-2024.  Phase 2 (Detailed Design Services) is expected to have a duration of approximately 24 months following the completion of Preliminary Design Services.  Phase 3 - Engineering Services during Construction is expected to have a duration of approximately 28 months.  \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $901,234.82\nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract - Phase 1 Preliminary Design                                                                $5,399,068.91 (ORD 3235-2022; PO363148)\nModification No. 1 - Preliminary Design - River Crossings                      $1,487,278.77 (ORD 2421-2023; PO409207)\nModification No. 2 - Detailed Design - Survey, Soil Borings                       $  901,234.82  (current)\nModification No. 3 - Detailed Design                                                                                $10,000,000.00  (estimated)\nModification No. 4 - Services during Construction                                           $2,500,000.00  (estimated)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                               $20,287,582.50   (estimated) \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nIt was the original plan to structure the contract to have contract modifications for the Detailed Design services and Services During Construction phases. In this case, it was decided to expedite a component of the detailed design phase prior to the completion of Phase I - Preliminary Design, in order to keep on Schedule and allow for the construction of at least one transmission main by December 31, 2028.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nms consutlants, inc. provided a cost proposal as requested by the City based on the current contract rates for job titles, allowable expenses, and overhead.  The fee proposal was reviewed by the Division of Water and deemed to be acceptable.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project was scoped with a significant public outreach program.  This outreach program will include public meetings, advisory group briefings for stakeholders, development of a project website, fact sheets, pop-up engagement at neighborhood gatherings, e-newsletters, social media posts, and news releases.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nms consultants, inc.’s contract compliance number is CC006998 and expires 12/1/25.\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against ms consultants, inc. or their subconsultants.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place with an ODI determined MBE/WBE program goal of 25.0%.  ms consultants, inc. is classified as a majority company.  ms consultants, inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this contract modification is expected to be 48.56%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, ms consultants, inc. has proposed the following subconsultants/subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                                           City/State                                ODI Certification Status\nResource International                                                       Columbus, Ohio                                      WBE\nAldea Services Inc.                                        Columbus, Ohio                                       MAJ\n7NT Engineering                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                       MBE\n \nThe certification of ms consultants, inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT\nThis design modification is expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account (WSRLA) through the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and administered by the Ohio Water Development Authority.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 0363-2024, passed by Council on 2/12/24.  This loan is expected to be approved in April, 2024.    \n \nA transfer of funds from the Water System Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Supply Revolving Loan Account Fund, Fund 6011, in the amount of $901,234.82 is needed to fund design for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the Ohio EPA to reimburse the Water System Reserve Fund.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to keep construction of the water lines needed for the new fourth water on schedule so the new water plant is able to provide water when construction is complete and it is brought online, meeting future anticipated water demands to prevent a water shortage.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a professional services contract modification with ms consultants, inc. to add funding for the Fourth Water Plant Transmission Main project;
