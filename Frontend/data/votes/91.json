    "description": "Explanation\nOn September 21, 2020, City Council passed Ordinance 1802-2020, creating a new chapter of the Columbus City Codes, Chapter 377, Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement.  Chapter 377 sets forth various provisions designed to ensure that entities who commit wage theft or payroll fraud do not do business with, or otherwise benefit from, contracts with the City of Columbus.  To that end, Ordinance 1802-2020 created a Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission, and set forth the procedures by which members of the Commission are to be appointed.  Division (d) of Section 377.02 currently provides that all initial appointments of members shall occur no later than January 15, 2021.  It is necessary to amend Section 377.02(d) to allow additional time for the initial members of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission to be appointed and seated.  \nThe remedies for violations of Chapter 377 are set forth in Section 377.12.  Section 377.12 currently contemplates that financial incentive agreements, including tax increment financing agreements, may be subject to termination for violations of Chapter 377.  Tax increment financing agreements, unlike many other financial incentive agreements, provide funding for public infrastructure improvements and other improvements designed to facilitate urban redevelopment within the City of Columbus.  These improvements often require bond financing or other front-end financing, which in turn is serviced by the service payments generated by the tax increment financing.  Feedback from the community has made clear that rendering tax increment financing agreements subject to termination for violations of Chapter 377 could undermine the ability of entities and the City to secure such front-end financing for such improvements.  It is, therefore, necessary to amend Section 377.12 to make clear that tax increment financing agreements which pledge service payments for the repayment of bond or other financing will not be subject to termination based upon a violation of Chapter 377 of the Columbus City Codes.  \nFISCAL IMPACT:  No funding is required for this legislation.\nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested in order to ensure that the City has adequate time to appoint members of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission and to ensure that the City may proceed with tax increment financing agreements under current negotiation that will benefit the City of Columbus.  \n \nTitle\nTo amend Section 377.02 of the Columbus City Codes to extend the deadline by which the initial members of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission may be appointed and seated; to amend Section 377.12 of the Columbus City Codes to clarify that tax increment financing agreements which pledge tax increment financing service payments for the service of debt will not be subject to termination based upon a violation of Chapter 377 of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, on September 21, 2020, City Council passed Ordinance 1802-2020, creating Columbus City Code Chapter 377, Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement; and\nWHEREAS, Section 377.02 sets forth the procedures by which initial members of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission shall be appointed; and \nWHEREAS, Division (d) of Section 377.02 requires that initial members of the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission be seated by January 15, 2021; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to extend the deadline for initial appointments to the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission to April 1, 2021 in order to afford the Mayor and City Council adequate time to make initial appointments, and to provide time for the Wage Theft Prevention and Enforcement Commission to meet in order to appoint the final member of the Commission, as provided in Section 377.02(c); and \nWHEREAS, tax increment financing agreements, as distinguished from many other types of financial incentive agreements, provide for the financing of public infrastructure improvements and other improvements designed to facilitate urban redevelopment within the City of Columbus; and\nWHEREAS, the design and construction of such improvements often require bond financing or other front-end financing, which in turn is serviced by the service payments generated by tax increment financing; and \nWHEREAS, feedback from the community has made clear that in order to maintain access to financing for such improvements it is necessary to amend Section 377.12, which sets forth the remedies for violations of Chapter 377, to clarify that any tax increment financing agreement which pledges service payments for the repayment of bond or other financing will not be subject to termination based upon a violation of Chapter 377 of the Columbus City Codes; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
