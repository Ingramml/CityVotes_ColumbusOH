    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Smoot Construction Company of Ohio for the Hoover Amenities Project. The contract amount is $3,000,000.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThe Hoover Amenities project is located at three distinct locations around the Hoover Reservoir. The fishing pier and boat launch ramp project aspects can be found near the intersection of Sunbury Road and Walnut Street at 7940 South Sunbury Road. The mudflats boardwalk is located at the north end of the reservoir and is located off of Front Street near Galena, Ohio. At both of these locations there are existing facilities that will require demolition and removal. The fishing pier will be newly installed infrastructure. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department proposes to deliver this project using a Construction Manager at Risk contract.  This delivery method will save the project money and time compared to traditional project delivery methods in this labor short market. CMAR is a “best value” selection in lieu of a “low bid” selection associated with traditional project deliveries. During a “best value” selection, a vendor’s qualifications are evaluated and weighted as part of a total score.  Costs, including project overhead, profit, and contingencies are evaluated, weighted, and scored. The vendor with the highest combined score represents the “best value.”  During this selection process, Smoot Construction Company of Ohio represented the “best value.”\n \nThis contract will allow for procurement of long lead time materials such as boardwalk piers, pre-manufactured concrete planks, and railings. Plans are currently eighty percent complete and materials are ready to be procured. Procuring these materials early reduces the duration of the construction schedule, saving overhead costs for the project which translates into significant project savings to the city. \n \nThe scope of the work shall include complete construction services starting with planning confirmation, design review, and completion of construction. This project will be constructed under a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) delivery method. The selected CMAR will coordinate work with the project design team.  This $3,000,000 contract is the first of two authorizations that will fund the construction of these amenities. There will be future guaranteed maximum price amendments for this contract provided by the CMAR after completion of design and competitive bidding for construction. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (Office of Diversity and Inclusion designation status):\n \nProposals were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on January 25, 2024 and initial responses were received by the Recreation and Parks Department on February 16, 2024. Following the receipt and evaluation of initial proposals and qualifications by the Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) selection committee, two vendors were provided a request for technical proposals and costs. Initial proposals were received from the following vendors:\n \nSmoot Construction Company of Ohio (MBE)\nThe Ruhlin Company (MAJ)\nRobertson Construction (MAJ)\nThe Righter Company (MAJ)\n \nAfter initial proposals were evaluated by the committee, Smoot Construction Company of Ohio and The Ruhlin Company were the vendors selected to submit technical proposals for review. The selection team recommend Smooth Construction of Ohio to perform the work. The firm was chosen based on their referenced projects, experience, qualifications, availability, timeline, project approach, and proposed fees.
