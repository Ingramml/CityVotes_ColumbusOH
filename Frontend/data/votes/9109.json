    "description": "Background\n \nThe Department of Building and Zoning Services (BZS) has an immediate need for the conversion of physical documents into electronic images.  Ordinance Nos. 2833-2014, 1487-2016, 0624-2017, 2762-2017, 0851-2018, 0765-2019, 2847-2019, 0657-2020, 1117-2021, 0648-2022, and 1401-2023 authorized purchase orders for document conversion and e-plan solution services. These document conversion services optimize storage space, reduce future storage costs, and provide efficient access to department information. \n \nThis legislation authorizes BZS to enter into a new contract for ongoing document conversion provided by 3SG Plus, LLC. In order to avoid a lapse in document conversion and e-plan solution services, 3SG has continued to provide such services until this legislation could be submitted. The term of the new contract is approximately six to seven months, as it will begin on the date a purchase order is confirmed and be in force through October 31, 2024. This legislation also retroactively authorizes payment for services rendered between November 1, 2023 and the date a purchase order is confirmed for a total cost of $207,609.80.\n \nIt is necessary to ask for a waiver of competitive bidding for this contract to ensure the continuation of these required services while BZS pursues a procurement effort with the assistance of DoT. . Prior ordinances for this service authorized entering into contract under sole source provisions as 3SG Plus, LLC was the sole authorized provider of Hyland OnBase Software, the City’s electronic content managing software. Recently however, multiple re-sellers of the service have been authorized, requiring that it be competitively bid out. BZS underestimated the technical complexity of these services in its 2023 procurement effort, which was ultimately unsuccessful. BZS will partner with the Department of Technology (DoT) in 2024 to leverage its expertise for an advanced procurement effort. \nEMERGENCY:\nEmergency action is requested to expedite authorization of this contract in order to facilitate and maintain uninterrupted services from the supplier for critical technology services.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \nVendor: 3SG Plus, LLC (D365 Vendor Acct.
