    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities, to enter into a contract with Elford, Inc. for the purchase of used trailers in an amount up to $499,000.00.\n \nCity Council approved awarding the construction contract for the Water Quality Assurance Lab Renovations project, CIP #690515-100000, to Elford, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “Elford”) via Ordinance #0339-2022, passed by City Council on 2/28/22.  As part of this project, it was necessary to establish a temporary laboratory facility to allow the Water Testing Lab to continue its work and for the Division of Water (DOW) to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements for testing while the permanent lab was being renovated.  The temporary lab consists of a triple-wide office trailer, a restroom trailer, and three sets of double-wide modular lab trailers.  The DOW has identified several potential secondary beneficial uses for these trailers to serve as office and lab spaces beyond the duration of the current project, including as temporary offices while the 910 Dublin Road office facility is renovated.  The trailer complex readily provides the available space for these uses without the need for additional costly capital renovations elsewhere. \n \nNow that the Water Quality Assurance Lab Renovations project is nearly completed, Elford does not have further use of the trailers.  As part of the contract, Elford will have to pay to have the trailers removed and to restore the land to its original condition.  Elford would then have to find a buyer for the trailers or otherwise dispose of them.  Elford is willing to sell the trailers to the DOW to avoid these costs. \n \n1.1. Amount of funds to be expended:  $499,000.00\nPurchase Used Trailers                                    $499,000.00\n \n1.2. How the cost was determined:\nThe Division of Water performed a cost benefit analysis on the purchase of new trailers versus used trailers.  By researching the median cost of used trailers it was determined the amount Elford was requesting for the used trailers was fair.  The DOW then negotiated with Elford to reduce the purchase price.\n \n2.  WAIVER OF COMPETITIVE BID REQUIREMENTS REQUESTED\nA waiver of the competitive bid requirements of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is requested as these are used trailers already configured for use as office and laboratory space and already in place on Department of Public Utilities property.   \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nElford’s contract compliance number is CC006059 and expires 12/28/2025.  \n                                                         \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding is available for this expenditure in the Water PayGo Fund, Fund 6016.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash between projects within Fund 6016 is needed to align cash with the proper project, then the funds will need to be appropriated. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities, to enter into a contract with Elford, Inc. for the purchase of used trailers; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash between projects within the Water PayGo Fund; to appropriate funds within the Water PayGo Fund; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code;
