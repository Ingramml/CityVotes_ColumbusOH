($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe City of Columbus, Division of Power (DOP) has some large transformers over 20 years old that are no longer needed. The transformers are operational; however, DOP wishes to donate eleven of the transformers ranging from 25 kilo-volt amperes (KVA) to 75 KVA to the Village of Lakeview, Ohio to aid in emergency power restoration that is needed due to recent tornado damages. The division is phasing these transformers out from the distribution system and will not replace them.\n \nThis ordinance requests a waiver of requirements in Chapter 329 of City Code for the sale of City-owned personal property. The waiver will bypass requirements to offer the assets to other City agencies and a bidding process, thus expediting Lakeview’s ability to utilize these transformers.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: \n \nNo funds are required.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:\n \nThis ordinance is being submitted as an emergency in order to expedite the Village of Lakeview’s ability to use surplus Division of Power transformers to aid in emergency power restoration as a result of recent tornado damages.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those documents necessary to transfer ownership of eleven transformers to the Village of Lakeview, Ohio to aid in emergency power restoration that is needed due to recent tornado damages; and to declare an emergency.
