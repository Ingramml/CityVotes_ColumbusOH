    "description": "Explanation\n \nColumbus and Central Ohio are growing. The city and its partners are working to embrace the opportunities of growth, while also addressing the challenges it brings.  Zoning is one of the most effective tools cities can use to manage change. It influences where we live, where we work, and how we get around. A 2021 assessment found that the current Columbus zoning code does not support our community’s aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city. Built around dated ideas of what people and businesses want, the current code inhibits the creation of much-needed housing and transit-supportive development. It is difficult to use, creating a heavy reliance on project-by-project negotiations, variances, and rezonings to accommodate even simple projects. \n \nIn response, Columbus embarked on the Zone In Initiative, the first comprehensive update of its zoning code in 70 years.  The goal of Zone In is to create a more effective, equitable, and sustainable framework for guiding land use, development, and growth.  City staff from the departments of Building and Zoning Services and Development worked with consultant teams focused on code development, led by Lisa Wise Inc., and community engagement, led by RAMA Consulting.   \n \nThe process also benefited from the active engagement of the Zone In Advisory Committee, which began its work in November 2022 with a charge from Mayor Ginther. Their mission was to help shape a comprehensive, community-responsive update fostering equitable opportunities for all Columbus residents.  A total of twelve meetings were held.  Summaries and presentations were posted on the Zone In project website.  Topics of discussion included public engagement strategies, project background and technical analysis, housing, parking, development capacity, corridor selection and prioritization, place type analysis and zoning code elements. Members provided a diverse cross-section of expertise in community issues, zoning, development, and equity disparities.  \n \nWhile modernized zoning is needed throughout Columbus, data, policy, and public input all tell us that our corridors are the best place to start. As outlined in the report “Where Do We Begin,” Phase One of the Zone In Initiative focuses on 140 miles of these “Main Streets” like West Broad Street, East Main Street, Morse Road, and commercial nodes like The Continent and the Eastland Mall site.  These areas have the greatest development capacity to deliver the housing, mobility, and employment opportunities our community needs in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable.  \n \nOn October 9, 2023, City Council passed Resolution #0179X-2023, wherein Council resolved to adopt and support the overall Zone In project goals and Phase One priorities, which focused on housing, mobility, urban design, equity, and local business.  The resolution further directed the Project Team to apply the goals and priorities in the development of recommendations for updated zoning during phase one of the effort.  The goals and priorities drew on extensive community engagement, technical analysis, adopted land use plans and larger efforts such as the Columbus Housing Strategy, LinkUS and the Climate Action Plan. \n \nAs the work of Zone In unfolded, a priority was that everyone, especially those who had not had their voices heard before, got a chance to weigh in and help shape the new code.  Residents, businesses, property owners, community groups, and others were able to follow the effort and share their thoughts as new zoning strategies were formulated. Thousands of people engaged through one-on-one conversations, workshops, community presentations, a digital survey, webinars, and social media.  Over five thousand written comments were received, over 100 presentations were made to community groups, and 15 community events were hosted throughout the City.  A total of 6,602 completed surveys were received, the project website saw 27,400 unique visits, and 78,000 postcards were mailed to property owners and renters along the corridor.  \n \nOn March 25, 2024, City Council adopted Ordinance #0830-2024, which amended Chapter 3310 and outlined the plan to create a new Title 34 of the Columbus City Codes.  Designated for the new 2024 Zoning Code, Title 34 will work in conjunction with the existing Title 33 Zoning Code.  The ordinance also codified the process to rezone properties from Title 33 zoning districts to Title 34 zoning districts.  This guidance is critical given the unique nature and scale of the Zone In Initiative.  This resolution responds to the process enacted pursuant to Ordinance #0830-2024.\n \nOn April 4, 2024, Mayor Andrew Ginther presented, for City Council’s consideration, the Zone In Columbus Phase One proposal to enact provisions of the 2024 Zoning Code. Based on adopted neighborhood and area plans, citywide policy priorities, and two years of technical analysis and engagement with thousands of residents, the proposal shows how we could create new mixed-use zoning along Columbus’ busiest streets.  Each district includes rules and standards for such things as land use, building height and setbacks, and form-based design elements.  The code includes a height bonus for projects committing to affordability and allows for market-driven parking solutions.  Additional code elements outline site development standards, such as street layout, screening, and lighting.\n \nThe Zone In Phase One proposal provided to Council includes a draft of Title 34, the 2024 Zoning Code, as well as maps and a parcel list depicting allocation of approximately 12,300 parcels of land to the new mixed use zoning districts.  Supporting documentation includes an overview of the proposal as well as summaries of the engagement and technical processes.  \n \nWith passage of this resolution, City Council states is intention to rezone identified parcels to the mixed-use zoning districts.  This action initiates a 60-day public review process outlined in Ordinance #0830-2024.  During this period, Area Commissions, the Historic Resources Commission, the Development Commission, and other applicable reviewing bodies will be provided with the Zone In Phase One proposal and supporting documentation.  The proposal will be made available to the general public on the project website, and featured in an interactive Zone In Gallery space at 141 North Front Street.  Mailing of notices to owners of impacted properties and owners of property within 125’ of impacted properties will coincide with the review period.  City Council will hold two or more public meetings during the comment period and an additional meeting at its conclusion to consider comments received prior to any further action.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  This resolution is being considered for emergency action in order to allow community review and comment on the draft Zone In Initiative Phase One proposal to proceed without delay.  Emergency consideration responds to the significant interest this initiative has generated and the need to pursue solutions to the housing crisis currently facing Central Ohio. \n \nTitle\nTo declare this Council’s intention to amend the Zoning Map by rezoning certain properties from Title 33 Zoning Code district designations to new Title 34 2024 Zoning Code district designations, and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, a 2021 assessment found that the current Columbus zoning code inhibits the creation of much-needed housing and transit-supportive development, is difficult to use and creates a heavy reliance on project-by-project negotiations;
