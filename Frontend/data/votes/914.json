    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement(s) for renovations of the dental clinic laboratory located at Columbus Public Health, 240 Parsons Avenue.  The existing UTC is established for the use of two vendors; 2K General and Elford. The Real Estate Management Office will determine which of these vendors is best suited to perform the necessary work to renovate the dental clinic based on proposals from each company.\n \nSuppliers:\n2K General Co.                                          Vendor Number #005739                      Exp. 7/13/2022\nElford Inc.                                           Vendor Number# 006059                      Exp. 5/27/2022\n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding for the project is available from the Public Safety GO Bond Fund 7701 ($33,000.00). These funds were sold as part of the 2012 bond sale for Safety and Health and the funds were inadvertently placed in Fund 7701 (Safety) instead of Fund 7706 (Health). Because the purpose clause is correct, these funds can be used for this project.\n \nEmergency Legislation:  The dental clinic located at the Columbus Department of Health is in need of several renovations. The project was anticipated to begin in 2020, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was placed on hold as the Columbus Health Department addressed the pandemic throughout 2020. The Department of Finance and Management in coordination with the Columbus Health Department feel the project can now begin and renovate the clinic which includes replacing broken cabinets, tables and counters. Thereore this legislation is requested as an emergency measure in order to avoid any delay of these necessary renovations to the dental clinic laboratory.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance and to establish purchase orders with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement(s) for the purchase of necessary dental laboratory renovations at 240 Parsons Avenue; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $33,000.00 from the Public Safety GO Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency ($33,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office has established Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements for the purchase of general contracting for maintenance, service, repairs and renovations with 2K General Co. and Elford Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is  necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance with the Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreements; and\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus Public Health operates a dental clinic located at 240 Parsons Avenue, which has an associated laboratory area; and\nWHEREAS, the existing dental laboratory is in need of immediate renovation; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the expenditure of funds for the renovation of the dental laboratory to allow the dental clinic to continue serving the community, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; now, therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management be and is hereby authorized to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance and to establish purchase orders with the appropriate Universal Term Contract Purchase Agreement(s) for the renovation of the dental laboratory located at 240 Parsons Avenue.
