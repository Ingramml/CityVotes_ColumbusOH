At the City’s request, CBRE may also act as a liaison and assist in the oversight of the design and build out of building renovations and improvements at these facilities. \n \nThis modification is necessary to add additional funding to and extend the term of the facility management agreement. It is necessary to extend the term of the contract through December 2024, to allow for the Department of Finance and Management to bid out these services via a Best Value Proposal solicitation. The original term was delayed 6 months from the intended start date.  By modifying the current contract to the end of the calendar year, it will allow for better budgeted forecasting going forward.  The current contract period ends on May 31, 2024.\n \nThe initial term of this contract was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 1223-2019 and was for the period June 1, 2019 - May 31, 2020, with four (4) annual renewal options.  The first contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 0873-2020 and was for the period June 1, 2020 - May 31, 2021.  A contract modification was done to add additional funds in the amount of $270,000 pursuant to ordinance 2100-2020.  The second contract renewal was awarded pursuant to Ordinance 0908-2021 and was for the period June 1, 2021 - May 31, 2022.
