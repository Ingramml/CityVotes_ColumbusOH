    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. Background:\nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from Clark Baltzell and Gloria Zaharoff, asking that the City sell them a 0.744 acre portion of right-of-way.  The right of way areas are also known as Bon Air Drive (0.331) and South Park Drive (0.413) with Llewellyn Road abutting each portion at the west and Cottage Street abutting at the east of each portion.  Right-of-way area is unimproved and exists within or adjacent to the parcel (PID=600-155355).\n \nTransfer of this right-of-way will facilitate the combining of the parcel while removing the right-of-way from the parcel and allowing removal of the division in their parcel for better continuity.  The Department of Public Service has agreed to transfer the right-of-way as described and shown within attached legal description and exhibit, and extinguishes its need for this public right-of-way.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way and that a general utility easement will be retained over the portions.  The Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for this right-of-way, and a value of $48,612.00 was established.  Applicant requested mitigation.  This request went before the Land Review Commission on August 17, 2023.  After review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to Clark Baltzell and Gloria Zaharoff, at the cost of $0.00 to them.\n \n2.
