    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: \nThis legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1712-2023, passed by City Council June 26, 2023, to allow a correction that authorizes the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages for MKSK’s work and pay reasonable contractor and subcontractor travel expenses to develop a comprehensive community plan for the Eastland area. This language was originally included in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and inadvertently omitted from the legislation. This needs to be corrected and to be reflective of the effective date of the contract.\nOrdinance No. 1712-2023 authorized the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods, on behalf of the City, to enter into contract with MKSK, to serve as the lead consultant for the development of a comprehensive community plan for the Eastland area. As lead consultant, MKSK is responsible for project management, community engagement, oversight of subcontractors and plan creation.\nEmergency action is requested in order to allow for the approval and reimbursement of expenses incurred since the effective date of the contract, and to honor the original intent as laid out in the RFP and prevent MKSK from experiencing financial hardship.\nContract Compliance: The vendor number is 028341 and contract compliance is 10/25/22-10/25/2024.\nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is required to modify this contract.\nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 1712-2023, passed by City Council on June 26, 2023, to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages expenses and reasonable contractor and subcontractor travel expenses for the development of the Eastland comprehensive community plan for the Eastland area, managed by MKSK; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00) \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1712-2023 passed by City Council on June 26, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a professional services contract with MKSK to develop a comprehensive community plan for the Eastland area.; and\nWHEREAS, the original intent as laid out in the RFP released March 3, 2023 included language that required the vendors to account for all costs that would be incurred as part of implementing the Scope of Work including, but not limited to food for outreach meetings, and travel expenses; and\nWHEREAS, it was recently discovered that the legislation did not clearly state that food and non-alcoholic beverages and reasonable contractor and subcontractor travel expenses would be an allowable expense by MKSK; and\nWHEREAS, the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods requests that Ordinance 1712-2023 be amended in order to correct the inadvertent omission of those items; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Neighborhoods in that it is immediately necessary to amend Ordinance 1712-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on June 26, 2023, in order to reimburse for the approved expenses incurred since the date of the agreement, to prevent MKSK from experiencing financial hardship and honor the original intent as laid out in the RFP, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the title of Ordinance No. 1712-2023 is hereby amended as follows:\nTo authorize the Director of Neighborhoods to enter into a contract with MKSK to develop a comprehensive community plan for the Eastland community; to authorize the expenditure up to $849,600.00 in the General Fund; to authorize payment for subcontractor travel expenses and reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for the outreach participants and to declare an emergency.

Reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage related expenditures will be allowable from the execution date of the contract. Travel costs shall be reimbursed in accordance with guidelines issued by the City Auditor.\nSECTION 4 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.\n \nSECTION 4. The existing Section 4 of Ordinance No. 1712-2023 is hereby repealed.\nSECTION 5. That all other sections of Ordinance No. 1712-2023 not expressly amended or repealed by this Ordinance shall remain in full force and effect.\nSECTION 6.
