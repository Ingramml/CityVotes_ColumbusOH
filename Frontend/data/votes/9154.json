    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance will authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to accept a grant in the amount of $46,823.00 from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for recycling and litter prevention at the 2024 Jazz & Rib Festival.\n \nThe Ohio Environmental Protection Association’s Community and Litter Grant, will assist in funding a robust waste diversion program at Jazz & Rib Fest. The Waste Diversion Program includes festival-wide recycling, with an onsite sorting center, pre-consumer composting, used cooking oil recycling, ash and charcoal composting, as well as purchasing a new supply of aluminum cups for beer sales. The aluminum cups are superior to traditional single-use plastic cups since aluminum can be recycled an infinite number of times without degrading, unlike plastic, which is deemed unusable after only a few times of being recycled. Since the implementation of the Diversion Program in 2022, Jazz & Rib Fest has diverted over 20,000 lbs of material from the landfill! \n \nPrincipal Parties:\nThe Ohio Environmental Protection Agency\n50 W Town St. Unit 700\nColumbus, Ohio, 43215\n \nBenefits to the Public: The promotion of recycling and prevention and efficient clean-up of litter during and after downtown festivals promotes a healthy, clean and appealing environment for our citizens.\n \nArea(s) Affected: The Scioto Mile festival area.\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the mission of the Columbus Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by developing partnerships to broaden service opportunities and ensure long-term care of facilities.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance will authorize the appropriation of $46,823.00 to the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund 2283.
