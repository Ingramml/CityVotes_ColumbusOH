    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  \nThe Office of CelebrateOne has received a grant award from the Franklin County Department of Jobs and Family Services to support the Health Equity Innovation and Birth Centers Initiative (HEIBC). \n \nSince 2014, CelebrateOne has led the development and implementation of strategic community-based initiatives targeting the unacceptably high infant mortality rate in Franklin County. Infant deaths are higher in CelebrateOne priority neighborhoods and are fueled by long standing racial disparities, limited resources and support. \n \nTo help achieve the goal of eradicating infant mortality in Columbus and Franklin County, CelebrateOne has adopted a new strategic plan that calls for deeper investments in racial equity, expanded efforts to address the social determinants of health, and a strong, connected health and social services system. \n \nFranklin County is providing up to $130,784.16 in reimbursable grant funding to CelebrateOne in support of reducing and eliminating infant mortality and racial disparities in Franklin County by researching and developing strategies to create accessible on-site and in-home birthing services guided by certified doulas and licensed midwives. In addition, The Health Equity Innovation and Birth Centers Initiative (HEIBC), plans to expand access for more intensive and intentional birth methods to address maternal and infant health outcomes, to meet the needs of mothers and children.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Health Equity Innovation initiative is funded by the Franklin County Department of Job and Family Services as a reimbursement grant.
