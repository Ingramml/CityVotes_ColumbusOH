    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $500,000.00 for the purpose of administering the Business District Safety Enhancement Program. Through this program, the Department of Public Safety will work in conjunction with the Division of Police and the Short North Alliance to develop plans to appropriately deter crime and improve safety in Columbus’ business districts.\n \nIn 2022 and 2023, the City of Columbus funded the Business District Safety Enhancement Program which resulted in a significant reduction of crime. There is a need for a continuation of this funding from the City of Columbus to supplement safety enhancements in the Short North business. The Short North Alliance will utilize this funding in support of their violent crime interdiction programs, which utilize law enforcement personnel serving in a special duty capacity, educational campaigns, and community outreach workers in an effort to prevent and address violent crime.\n \nThis neighborhood safety program is part of a much larger community investment strategy employed by the City to provide safe and resilient communities. The City of Columbus has utilized a community wide approach under a number of assistance programs including summer youth safety programming as well as numerous Neighborhood Safety Grants. The City will make additional neighborhood safety investments in subsequent ordinances.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested so that necessary funds can be provided to the Short North Alliance to adequately plan in advance of the upcoming Spring and Summer seasons. \n \nFiscal Impact: $500,000.00 is budgeted and available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a grant agreement with the Short North Alliance in support of the Business District Safety Enhancements Program; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $500,000.00 within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
