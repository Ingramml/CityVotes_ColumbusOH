    "title": "To authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify the contract with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the Electrical Upgrades Program to extend it an additional year to May 19, 2025.  ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a zero dollar contract modification to extend the contract term for one year for professional engineering services with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the DOSD Electrical Upgrades Program, CIP #650346-100003, for the Division of Sewerage and Drainage (DOSD).\n \nThe purpose of this project is to identify and plan replacement of electrical infrastructure that is no longer supported or no longer has commercially available spare parts.  Equipment that is no longer supported represents increased risk of failure and permit violations at Jackson Pike Waste Water Treatment Plant, Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant, Southwest Composting Facility, and Collection System Pump Stations.  \n \nThe original contract was a three year contract starting in 2021 and ending with the final closeout of work assigned prior to the end of the contract work assignment window in 2024, specifically May 19, 2024.  The work for this contract was delayed in starting due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This extension is needed to give DOSD time to evaluate the work that has been delivered to this point to determine if the contract can deliver the needed information or if the contract needs to be cancelled.  It is anticipated it will take the rest of the calendar year to make this decision.  If the decision is the contract cannot deliver the needed information, the contract will be cancelled.  If the decision is the contract can deliver the needed information, a future modification will be needed to extend the contract term and add the planned funding modifications.     \n \nCommunity Planning Area: 99-Citywide.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $0.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                          $2,187,466.84 (ORD 0419-2021 PO273377)\nModification #1 (current):                                                                $0.00  \nTotal (Orig. + Modification):                                                $2,187,466.84\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded using the City’s RFP process with planned modifications to add funding to complete the process.  Another procurement process is not required to complete the contract.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThe purpose of this project is to identify and plan replacement of electrical infrastructure that is no longer supported or no longer has commercially available spare parts. Equipment that is no longer supported represents increased risk of failure and permit violations at Jackson Pike WWTP, Southerly WWTP, Southwest Composting Facility and Collection System Pump Stations. No community outreach or environmental factors are considered for this project. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nHDR Engineering, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC008851 and expires 5/19/24.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  HDR Engineering, Inc is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  HDR Engineering, Inc anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of sub-consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this contract is expected to be 21.7%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, HDR Engineering, Inc. has proposed the following five subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                        City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nCDM Smith Inc.                                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                         MAJ\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.      Columbus, Ohio                                                                        MBE\nCAD Concepts, Inc.                                                        Columbus, Ohio                                                                        WBE\nDynotec, Inc.                                                                     Columbus, Ohio                                                                         MBE\nResource International, Inc.                                       Columbus, Ohio                                                                         WBE\n \nThe certification of HDR Engineering, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT\nThis ordinance is to modify the current contract to extend another year to May 19, 2025 without adding additional funding.  There will be no fiscal impact.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify the contract with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the Electrical Upgrades Program to extend it an additional year to May 19, 2025.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the DOSD Electrical Upgrades Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO273377 was authorized by Ordinance No. 0419-2021 for the DOSD Electrical Upgrades Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the project has been on-hold; and\n \nWHEREAS, the contract needs to be evaluated to determine if it can produce the information needed by DOSD; and \n \nWHEREAS, a contract modification is required to give the time needed to evaluate the contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the professional engineering services agreement with HDR Engineering, Inc. for the DOSD Electrical Upgrades Program; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of Public Utilities is hereby authorized to modify the current contract with HDR Engineering, Inc., 8890 Lyra Drive, Suite 100, Columbus, Ohio  43240, for the DOSD Electrical Upgrades Program to extend it an additional year to May 19, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
