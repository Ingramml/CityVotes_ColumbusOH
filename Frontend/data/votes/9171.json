    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Development has a Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Grant Program which provides grants to improve access to clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. Grants of up to $5 million for construction projects are available to Ohio communities. All political subdivisions with the authority to own and operate public water and sewer systems and non-profit, non-community public water systems may submit an application. Eligible construction projects can receive a maximum grant amount of $5 million. The City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an application. \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to formally apply for a funding under this program. It also authorizes the execution of agreements with Ohio Department of Development or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\nThe Department of Public Utilities has identified a project (Blueprint Hilltop - Eureka/Fremont)  that is part of City of Columbus’ Consent Order program Blueprint Columbus, which will reduce storm water inflow and infiltration to the sanitary sewer system to prevent overflows and water in basement events. This project will construct nine large regional bio-retention basins, four rain gardens, up to 3,000 feet of water line replacement and up to 2,600 feet of new storm sewer in the Hilltop neighborhood. The construction is anticipated to start in mid 2024 and complete in May 2026. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nApproval of this legislation will authorize the Director of Public Utilities to appropriate and expend grant funds received from Ohio Department of Development.
