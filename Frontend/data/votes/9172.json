    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources provides funding for the Rehabilitation of High Hazard Potential Dams through the High Hazard Potential Dam Program. Project participants request to be a sub-applicant of the State of Ohio into the federal process.  The grant request funding cap is $7,500,000 or 12.5% of the total amount of funds made available, with 35% matching funds required for projects.  Once funded the period of performance is 36 months. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources accepts applications for eligible participants to apply for funding on a competitive process. \nBased on correspondence received from the Franklin County Emergency Management and Homeland Security office, Hoover and Griggs Dams are not rated poorly, however both Hoover and Griggs Dams are eligible to submit a request for funding and could be evaluated on a case by case basis due to the at risk population downstream. \nThe City requests grant funding consideration for the following:   \n(1)                     The Griggs Dam Rehabilitation project requests $500,000 in grant funds to repair a series of concrete deficiencies at the base of numerous security fence posts along the top Griggs dam. This project will repair the concrete and re-anchor the fence posts to improve security, public safety, and overall dam safety. \n(2)                     The Hoover Dam Rehabilitation project requests $800,000 in grant funds to address the erosion at a site on Sunbury Road along Hoover Reservoir that was identified in the Hoover Erosion Study as a site needing erosion protection. Erosion occurs due to wave action, changing reservoir levels and ice damage along the reservoir shorelines. This project will construct erosion control measures to attempt to stop the erosion.\n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nApproval of this legislation will authorize the Director of Public Utilities to appropriate and expend grant funds received from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to apply for participation in the Rehabilitation of High Hazard Potential Dam Program from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources; to authorize the execution of the grant and other requisite agreements with ODNR for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds.  ($0.00). \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) announced available funding for the Rehabilitation of High Hazard Potential Dam Program, which is a grant program that includes funds to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\nWHEREAS, ODNR is offering an opportunity for grant funding; and \nWHEREAS, the City requests funding consideration for the Griggs Dam and Hoover Dam projects; and\nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities be and is hereby authorized to submit an application for a grant to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources; to accept said grant, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said application, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities.\nSECTION 2.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to execute any agreement or other documents necessary to effectuate applying for and receiving ODNR program grant funding.\nSECTION 3.  That the Department of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\nSECTION 4.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
