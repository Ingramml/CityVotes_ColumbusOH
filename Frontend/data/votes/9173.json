    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe Brightening Ohio Communities (BOC) program is designed to provide grants to implement cost-effective, energy efficiency improvements for streetlights, perimeter lighting, and municipal-owned parking lot lighting in communities across Ohio. Funding for this program comes from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program, made possible by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Ohio was one of eight states awarded federal funding on Oct. 12 through the first round of the EECBG program. \nOhio Department of Development is accepting applications for this program. This program provides $3,130,030 with each county being eligible to receive a maximum award of $500,000. Local units of government applying may submit multiple applications or multiple projects on one application, but total funding will be limited to $500,000 per county. At a minimum, $1,252,012 will be used for projects located within Ohio’s Disadvantaged Communities. \nThe Department of Public Utilities proposed project (Hilltop Phase II Street Lighting Project) includes smart lighting improvements in the South Side Columbus neighborhoods area generally bounded by High Street on the west, Livingston Avenue on the north, Alum Creek Drive to the east and Marion Road to the south.  The Department is requesting $500,000 for the project which will replace approximately 3,900 existing HPS lights with LED lights that will be connected to a central control system. The street lighting activity falls within the consolidated plan goal for Public Facilities/Infrastructure Improvement and addresses the Low/Moderate Income Area Benefit National objective. The project is located in a primarily residential service area with approximately 70% residents who are low/moderate income and all the residents in the service area will benefit from the smart lighting improvement. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nApproval of this legislation will authorize the Director of Public Utilities to appropriate and expend grant funds received from the Ohio Department of Development. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to apply for a Brightening Ohio Communities Grant for the Hilltop Phase II Street Lighting Project from the Ohio Department of Development; to authorize award of the grant if funded; and to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds.  ($0.00). \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Development provides funding for the Brightening Ohio Communities Program, which is a grant program that includes funds to be awarded on a competitive basis; and\nWHEREAS, ODOD is offering an opportunity for grant funding; and \nWHEREAS, the City requests funding for construction funds for the Hilltop Phase II Street lighting Project;  and \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities be and is hereby authorized to submit an application for a grant for the Ohio Department of Development; to accept said grant, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said application, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Utilities.\nSECTION 2.  That the Director of the Department of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to execute any agreement or other documents necessary to effectuate applying for and receiving the ODOD  program grant funding.\nSECTION 3.  That the Department of Public Utilities be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\nSECTION 4.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\nSECTION 5.  That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
