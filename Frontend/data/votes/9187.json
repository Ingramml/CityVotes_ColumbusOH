    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to enter into grant agreements with three not-for-profit organizations known as the Short North Alliance, Inc., the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and the Columbus Fashion Initiative dba Columbus Fashion Alliance in the amount of $100,000.00 each in support of their open streets event programming.\n \nIn 2023, the Short North Alliance, Inc. piloted one of the largest ever open streets experiences in Columbus in the City's largest, busiest, and most prominent streets. With support from Columbus City Council and dozens from within the private sector, the Holiday Hop event was re-imagined into an open streets format to elevate inclusivity, showcase spaces for people and not just cars, and provide momentum for the small business community at a critical time when they needed it the most after a tough year. Initiatives like this have proven very popular and are important teaching tools to demonstrate to residents the importance of experiencing Columbus and its amenities not only through a single-occupancy vehicle experience, but also as a pedestrian or micro-mobility user.\n \nThe Short North Alliance, Inc. has planned three open-streets initiatives: gallery hop on June 1 and Sept. 7, and Holiday Hop on December 7. These events will create synergy with other Columbus festivities including Pride Month and the Gallery Hop's 40th anniversary.\n \nThis year, the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc. and the Columbus Fashion Alliance are both planning to host open-streets events as well. Similar to the Short North Alliance, Inc.'s planned events, this programming will offer residents in different parts of the City the opportunity to experience the open-streets concept for the first time in conjunction with downtown events and 614 Day. The Columbus Fashion Alliance is providing event production services to the City for the 614 Day open streets event.\n \nA separate contract in the amount of $25,000 of remaining appropriation will be established by the Interim Director of Public Service at a later date.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.  An appropriation of $325,000.00 is necessary in the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiative subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 for this expenditure.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate $325,000.00 within the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiative Subfund; to authorize the Interim Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into grant agreements with the Short North Alliance, Inc., the Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District of Columbus, Inc., and the Columbus Fashion Initiative dba Columbus Fashion Alliance in support of their respective open-streets event programming; and to authorize the expenditure of $300,000.00 within the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($325,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City has a history of working with nonprofit organizations to execute open streets events for residents; and\n \nWHEREAS, considering the development of public transit and micro-mobility user-friendly plans like LinkUS, the City has a special interest in reaching a broader audience and demonstrating for residents what the pedestrian experience is like; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City and its residents will benefit greatly from transitioning away from a society that caters only to single-occupant vehicles, and toward a society that prioritizes the safety of residents and the walk-ability and accessibility of our communities; and\n \nWHEREAS, the nonprofit organizations included in this ordinance will create synergy with other well-established City programming, such as Pride Month and 614 Day; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $325,000.00 in the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 2.

That the expenditure of $300,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 2 of this ordinance, is hereby authorized in the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
