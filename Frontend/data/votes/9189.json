    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  In July 2022, the Office of CelebrateOne was awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Medicaid which is administered by the State’s Managed Care Plans for the 2022-2024 Grant cycle. The grant acceptance and sub-grantee awards were legislated with Ordinance 1723-2022.  Of the remaining appropriation, CelebrateOne, with approval of the Ohio Department of Medicaid requests to realign the grant funding among eleven (11) of the twelve (12) non-profit sub-grantees/community partners\n \nThe Ohio Department of Medicaid has awarded this grant to the Office of CelebrateOne at the City of Columbus to coordinate the Enhanced Maternal Health Program in Franklin County. CelebrateOne has been designated as the primary grantee organization and administrator for this grant in Franklin County.  The original ordinance (Ord. 1723-2022) established twelve (12) contracts with community partners in order to provide health and education services to pregnant persons and those with children under age one (1).\n \nIn addition to the twelve sub-grantee awards, the original ordinance appropriated $969,275.44 for CelebrateOne Community Health Worker salaries and benefits as they assisted pregnant and parenting families.  Due to CelebrateOne Community Health Worker staffing levels, more outreach will be done by the existing sub-grantee community partners.  As a result, it is necessary to realign the funding set forth in Ordinance 1723-2022.  \n \nThe following existing sub-grantees/community agencies, will receive the re-allocated grant funds as follows:\n \n\n\n\nSub Grantee/Community Partner\n\nOriginal Contract Amount\n\nAdditional Funding\n\n\n\nCity of Refuge Good Life Foundation\n\n$252,674.28\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nThe Center for Healthy Families\n\n$200,000.00\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nHeart of Ohio Family Health Centers\n\n$246,271.00\n\n$45,000.00\n\n\n\nMental Health America of Ohio\n\n$160,383.32\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nMoms2B/The Ohio State University\n\n$702,636.00\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nOhioHealth\n\n$220,275.44\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nPhysicians CareConnection\n\n$412,704.00\n\n$40,000.00\n\n\n\nPrimaryOne Health\n\n$383,131.31\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nProject Milk Mission\n\n$180,844.00\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nUrban Family Development Center\n\n$187,182.00\n\n$20,000.00\n\n\n\nYMCA of Central Ohio\n\n$241,921.21\n\n$45,000.00\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal\n\n$290,000.00\n\n\n \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is requested at this time in order to meet grant deliverable deadlines and provide time-sensitive perinatal and postnatal health and education services to pregnant and parenting families within Columbus.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes the realignment of funding originally appropriated (Ord. 1723-2022) within the General Government Grant Fund #2220, from Object Level 01 to Object Level 03.
