    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to accept the award for the 2023 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant, G602100, in the amount of $167,302.25 from American Municipal Power, Inc. (AMP) and to modify the non-profit service contract with Solar United Neighbors (SUN) and IMPACT Community Action for the Low- to Moderate-Income (LMI) Solar Co-Op program. This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of the 2023 grant award for this contract modification to fund the Co-Op for Division of Power LMI customers.\n \nThe EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant program was instituted by AMP to return unused funds to participating members, recognizing EcoSmart Choice participating communities that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability through the promotion of environmentally focused, community based grant projects. Funds are unused if market renewable energy certificate (REC) prices are lower than anticipated. \n \nExpenditures of prior year EcoSmart Choice Grant Funds contributed to DOP’s SMART Street Lighting Project and an offer of smart thermostats to customers in connection with the ongoing Enhanced Meter Project.\n \nIn alignment with the Columbus Climate Action Plan, the Sustainable Columbus office has an existing contract with SUN and IMPACT Community Action for a low- to moderate-income (LMI) solar co-op program, authorized by Ordinance 2271-2023. IMPACT Community Action works directly with SUN to identify potential Co-Op participants, mostly through their weatherization program: a federal program that provides energy efficiency upgrades and includes a home audit. The services included in this agreement cannot be provided by existing city employees because these services are beyond the City’s current staffing capacity to provide. \n \nThe Division of Power’s EcoSmart Choice grant award will cover 100% of the installation costs for eligible and participating DOP customers. Estimated costs vary from $10,000 to $15,000 per customer for an average 4-kilowatt (kW) solar photovoltaic (PV) installation, and $15,000 for a battery, so the $167,302.25 could fully fund 11 to 16 solar PV-only projects, 5 to 6 solar PV plus battery storage projects, or a combination thereof for Division of Power LMI customers. \n \nVENDOR\n \nSolar United Neighbors | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #018434 | Expires 9/27/2025 | \nThe company does not hold MBE or WBE status.\n \nSUBCONTRACTOR\n \nIMPACT Community Action | EIN on file | D365 Vendor #001447 | Expires 11/8/2025 | \nThe company does not hold MBE or WBE status.\n \nNeither the Contractor nor Subcontractor are debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT  \n \nThe EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant Program returns unused program funds to participating members through sustainability grants, of which DOP is eligible for $167,302.25 for the 2023 EcoSmart Choice program year. This ordinance authorizes an appropriation of this same amount from the Electricity Grants Fund to fund residential customer solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage projects. This project will focus on lower/middle income residential DOP customers, with 100% of the installation cost covered by the grant. \n \n$247,000.00 was spent on the Co-Op in 2023\n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to accept the 2023 EcoSmart Choice Sustainability Grant Award in the amount of $167,302.25 for the Division of Power; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the contract with Solar United Neighbors (SUN) and IMPACT Community Action for the Low- to Moderate-Income (LMI) Solar Co-Op program; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $167,302.25 from the Electricity Grants Fund to support this modification.
