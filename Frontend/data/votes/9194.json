    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Complete General Construction Company for the Noble and Fourth Inflow Redirection project, CIP #650790-100000, in an amount up to $2,168,782.20; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction administration and inspection services in an amount up to $2,000.00 (for a total expenditure of $2,170,782.20). \n \nThis contract is for the redirection of public sources of inflow of six acres of the Noble / 4th sewer shed.  In order to facilitate the redirection of the inflow, this contract includes the construction of 502 feet of 10-inch sanitary sewer along Noble Street between 5th Street and 4th Street.  The new 10-inch sanitary sewer will connect to an existing 72-inch combined sewer at the intersection of Noble and 4th.  This project will also repurpose the existing 24-inch combined sewer on Noble Street to a dedicated storm sewer by abandoning CSO 510, diverting all flows to the storm 72” storm sewer.  By separating the storm and sanitary sewer, the flows in the sanitary can be relieved to reduce overflows into the storm sewer.  The project will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.\n \nThe City of Columbus and the State of Ohio entered into a consent order in August of 2002 to resolve sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) related concerns for the City’s sanitary sewer system.  The consent order requires the City to develop and implement a program to provide adequate capacity in the collection system, taking all feasible steps to address SSO’s.  This is one of the projects implemented to comply with the consent order.  The improvements must be completed by July 1, 2025, to comply with the consent order.    \n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 55, Downtown.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Sanitary work is to be substantially complete within 240 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed. All work, including sanitary sewer and storm sewer work, is to be substantially complete within 365 calendar days of the Notice to Proceed with final completion to occur within 425 calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $2,168,782.20, including a 20% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                         $2,168,782.20\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                         $0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                                   $2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                 $2,170,782.20\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will install new sanitary sewer and repurpose the existing combined sewer to a dedicated storm sewer.  By separating the storm and sanitary sewer, the flows in the sanitary can be relieved to reduce overflows into the storm sewer. The project will reduce inflow and infiltration to the City’s sanitary sewer system thus mitigating sanitary sewer overflows to basements and waterways.  The project will also provide improvement to existing storm infrastructure.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Public Sanitary Sewers for Noble and Fourth Inflow Redirection project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 12/22/23 through 01/24/24.  One bid was received for the project and opened on 01/24/24.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \n                    Company                                      Bid Amount    Compliance Number       ODI Status\nComplete General Construction Company            $2,168,782.20            CC006056                     MAJ\n \nThe Complete General Construction Company bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $2,168,782.20.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nComplete General Construction Company’s contract compliance number is CC006056 and expires 5/10/25.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Complete General Construction Company \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nComplete General Construction Company listed the following companies as subcontractors for this project:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nVisu-Sewer of Ohio LLC                           Reynoldsburg, Ohio                                        MAJ\nCAP-Stone & Associates, Inc.                    Columbus, Ohio                                            WBE\nDecorative Paving Company                      Norwalk, Ohio                                                MAJ\nBridges Bros.
