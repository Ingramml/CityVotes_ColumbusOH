    "description": "Title\n \nTo Recognize April 14- 20th as Reentry Week within the City of Columbus and Recognize ARCH for their Reentry Services\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, each year, over 600,000 individuals return to their communities from State and Federal prisons; including approximately 2,000 people each month returning from prison or jail to our own community; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the challenges facing formerly incarcerated people during their transition back into society are far-reaching, including finding and maintaining employment, locating safe and affordable housing, obtaining reliable transportation, reuniting with family, accessing health care and mental health services, and dealing with the trauma of reentry which can lead to recidivism; and,\n \nWHEREAS, every person has value and deserves the opportunity to unlock a broader future, and a conviction history should not unfairly exclude them from doing so, especially regarding fair access to public benefits, housing, employment, and the right to vote; and,\n \nWHEREAS, ARCH (Accompanying Returning Citizens With Hope) is a nonprofit organization founded in 2017 with a mission to help returning citizens reintegrate into the community on their terms; and,\n \nWHEREAS, Based in Columbus, Ohio, ARCH has emerged as a leader in reentry programs, offering a range of services including reentry planning, wrap-around services such as jobs and housing support, vocational training in solar panel installation, and assistance with social enterprises like Cafe Overlook; and,\n  \nWHEREAS,  ARCH's commitment goes beyond service provision; they are dedicated to developing leadership among individuals directly impacted by the justice system, evident in their staff and program development; now therefore,\n \nBE IT RESOLVED THAT THIS COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: Declares April 14-20, 2024 Reentry Week within the City and encourages residents to support individuals who are returning to their communities after being released from incarceration.",
