    "description": "Title\nTo Recognize and Celebrate the Grand Opening of G’s Shephard Springs Cafe\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, located at 900 Sunbury Road Columbus, Ohio 43219, in the Shepard Subdivision and Saint Mary’s of the Springs Subdivisions, G's Shepard Springs Cafe provides more than a great coffee experience; and \n \nWHEREAS, the name Shepard Springs Café is a nod to local history, combining both the Shepard neighborhood and St. Mary of the Springs College, which became the nearby Ohio Dominican University; and \n \nWHEREAS, Ray A. Jones and Gladys Maricel Alvarez Morales created a café that serves more than food to the community, the café spurs additional development; and\n \nWHEREAS, with a menu selection of healthy fresh foods, brewed coffee using the highest quality beans to create custom coffee blends having their own unique taste of expressos, cappuccinos, mochas along with various types of teas. In addition, the café will offer private meeting rooms to accommodate customers wanting to hold private meetings; and \n \nWHEREAS, the impact will spur revitalization in an area that had lost much of its commercial and retail service during the construction period of the Interstate 670 Highway system, built in the 1970’s; and\n \nWHEREAS, G’s Shepard Springs Café will create jobs, increase tax revenues, spur economic development, create a bilingual atmosphere (English & Spanish) and provide healthy meals in an area considered a food desert along with occasional entertainment; now, therefore \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate the grand opening of G’s Shephard Springs Cafe.",
