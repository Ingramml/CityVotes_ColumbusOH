    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend two (2) existing Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the option to obtain General Maintenance Service Repairs and Renovations with 2K General Company, CC# 005739, expires 6/14/2024 and Elford, Inc., CC# 006059, expires 12/28/2025.  These contracts provide for general maintenance service, repairs and renovations for the Facilities Management Division and other city agencies, not serviced by the in-house staff of the Facilities Management Division.  The contracts, PO266882 with 2K General Company and PO266879 with Elford, Inc. were established in accordance with Request for Quotation RFQ016830 and will expire July 31, 2024. \n \n No additional funds are necessary to modify the option contracts as requested.  There is no change in the type of products or services being procured.  The original contract was formally bid.  The original terms and conditions will remain in effect. The amount spent on renovations and maintenance projects has exceeded the estimated amount to be spent annually. It is in the best interest of the City to extend the contracts an additional six (6) months, allowing sufficient time to advertise a formal bid ( using the best value procurement process) and establish a new contract to satisfy services needed at various City locations.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  The Finance and Management Department respectfully requests this legislation  be considered  an emergency to modify and extend the option contracts with 2K General Company, PO266882 and Elford, Inc. PO266879 for a period of six (6) months, from July 31, 2024 to and including January 31, 2025; as the current contracts expire on July 31, 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required to modify the option contracts.  City departments must set aside their own funding for their estimated expenditures.  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director to modify and extend the Universal Term Contracts for the option to purchase Maintenance Service Repairs and Renovations with 2K General Company and Elford, Inc., and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Purchasing Office entered into two (2) Universal Term Contracts for General Maintenance Service Repairs and Renovations for use by the Facilities Management Division and other city agencies, not serviced by the in-house staff of the Facilities Management Division; and  \n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify and extend these existing contracts with 2K General Company and Elford, Inc., to ensure that general maintenance service repairs and renovations can be performed on city buildings.\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Facilities Management Division and other city agencies, and the current contracts expire on July 31, 2024, it is necessary to authorize the Finance and Management Director to immediately modify and extend the Universal Term Contracts with 2K General Company and Elford, Inc., for the option to obtain General Maintenance Service Repairs and Renovations, thereby preserving the, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore: \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Finance and Management Director is hereby authorized to modify and extend the option contracts with 2K General Company PO266882 and Elford, Inc.

That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.  \n \nSECTION  3. That for reasons stated in the Preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after the passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
