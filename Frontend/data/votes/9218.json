    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton, Inc. (EMH&T) in the amount of up to $600,000.00 for the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road project.\n \nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources to design a new railroad-coordinated traffic signal and widen the north and west approaches to the intersection of Refugee Road and Hines Road. Hines Road will be widened on the approach to the intersection to include two lanes (dedicated southbound right- and left-turn lanes). Refugee Road west of the intersection will be widened to include three lanes (eastbound through, eastbound left turn, and westbound through.) Striping on Refugee Road east of the intersection will be adjusted to accommodate the eastbound left turn lane. A mast arm traffic signal system with LED heads will be installed, with a mast arm on both north and east approach.\n \nOrd. 2394-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to submit ODOT Highway Safety Improvement Program project applications and to execute project agreements for awarded projects for the Department of Public Service for the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road project.  \nThe Department of Public Service, Office of Support Services, solicited Requests for Proposals for the Intersection Improvements - Refugee Road at Hines Road contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire web sites from February 21, 2024, to March 20, 2024.  The City received three (3) responses.  All proposals were deemed responsive and were fully evaluated when the Evaluation Committee met on March 27, 2024.  The responding firms were:  \nCompany Name                                                     City/State            Majority/MBE/WBE/VET/EBE/LGBTBE/SLBE\nEMH&T                                                                                                         Columbus, OH                                                                MAJ\nA.
