    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with WSP USA, Inc. to add additional funds for design of the Roadway - Downtown Multimodal Transportation project.\nOrdinance 3091-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with WSP USA, Inc. for the Roadway - Downtown Multimodal Transportation project.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources to identify feasible alternatives for enhanced mobility throughout Downtown Columbus. Concepts for potential reconfiguration of streets have emerged through multiple ongoing planning efforts and include dedicated transit lanes, protected bicycle facilities, regional trail connections, and one-way/two-way street conversions. This project will examine the feasibility of potential street reconfiguration alternatives, including traffic operations analysis, right-of-way impacts, parking/curbside management, multi-modal connections, safety needs, assessment of design trade-offs and recommendation of preferred alternatives. This ordinance authorizes the Interim Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $250,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $250,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $500,000.00     (PO361263, Ord. 3091-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                             $250,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                                 $750,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nDue to the complexity of this design and the many stakeholders and agencies involved, the preliminary design has expanded its original scope and funds are needed to continue the traffic analysis and planning for the entire downtown network. Additional analyses are needed, along with continuing coordination among project teams for the LinkUS Bus Rapid Transit corridors.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe downtown preliminary design will impact the design deadlines of the other Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes and how they converge downtown. E Main Street and W Broad Street have design goals this year in order to meet funding deadlines for the Federal Transit Authority. The preliminary design needs to move forward as quickly as possible, and with the knowledge that the consultant team already has after leading the preliminary design for the past year.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against WSP USA, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for WSP USA, Inc. is CC000455 and expires 05/11/2024.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of cash and appropriation is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n4.
