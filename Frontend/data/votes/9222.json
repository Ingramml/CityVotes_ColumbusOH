    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to enter into a contract with ODOT to participate in the winter cooperative purchasing contract; to enter into a contract with ODOT's selected vendors (to be determined at a later date) for the purchase of rock salt per the guidelines of the cooperative purchasing contracts; and to authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to establish purchase orders with ODOT's selected vendors for the Department of Public Service and the Department of Public Utilities.  The funding authorized by this ordinance is for expenses that will occur during the winter months of 2024-2025.  \n  \nThe Department of Public Service and the Department of Public Utilities are responsible for snow and ice control and removal on the city's roadway system.  In removing snow and ice, the departments use rock salt extensively in these operations.  It is necessary for the Department of Public Service and the Department of Public Utilities to have the ability to purchase rock salt for the 2024-2025 winter season.  \n \nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is in the process of establishing its annual cooperative purchasing contracts which allows participating government agencies to purchase rock salt from selected vendors.  ODOT will determine the vendors for these contracts.  ODOT will bid the cooperative purchasing contract as a cooperative contract for use by other governmental agencies, in accordance with Chapter 5513.01 (B) of the Ohio Revised Code.  \n \nIn an effort to clarify the rules for participation in the joint purchasing agreement, the Ohio Department of Transportation now requires additional language be approved.  That language is included in this ordinance in order to ensure the Department of Public Service and the Department of Public Utilities are compliant with all Ohio Department of Transportation purchasing rules and regulations for participating in the joint purchasing effort. \n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\n$484,000.00 is budgeted and available in the Department of Public Service Municipal Motor Vehicle License Tax Fund.  $68,200.00 total is budgeted and available in the Department of Public Utilities Sewerage System, Water Systems, and Electricity Systems Operating Funds. \n \n3.
