    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Greenscapes Landscape Company for the Street Tree Installation Spring 2021 - Greater Hilltop and North Central UIRF Project. The contract amount is $88,109.00, with a contingency of $10,000.00, for a total of $98,109.00 being authorized by this ordinance.\n \nThis project will be installing 307 trees in the right-of-ways along various streets in the North Central and Greater Hilltop Neighborhoods through the Urban Infrastructure Recovery Fund (UIRF) program. This effort will help replace tree species that have been removed throughout the city due to tree mortality. The new tree plantings will represent a diverse species of trees selected specifically for each planting location, being careful not to interfere with nearby utilities or structures. This effort takes into consideration the specific site restrictions that each location has in an effort to replace some of our lost Urban Tree Canopy. These plantings are part of the Sustainable Columbus efforts, a green initiative helping to reduce storm water runoff, clean our air, provide shade, and more. \n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on March 16, 2021 and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 31, 2021.
