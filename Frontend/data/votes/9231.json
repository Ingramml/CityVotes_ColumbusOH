    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe Office of CelebrateOne (in collaboration with Columbus Public Health) was awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health for the 2023 grant cycle, January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.  This grant was accepted and appropriated with the passage of Ordinance 0474-2023. The Ohio Department of Health has extended this grant period through June 30, 2024 and provided additional funding for the six-month extension in an amount of up to $288,950.00.  \n \nThis ordinance is to accept and appropriate $288,950.00 in grant money to fund the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 for the period January 1, 2024 to June 30, 2024.  This project allows CelebrateOne to focus on zip codes in Franklin County with the greatest potential to impact the birth outcomes of pregnant African-American women at risk for preterm and low birth weights in Franklin County. It will also cover the Fetal Infant Mortality Review community-based program that identifies local infant mortality issues and develops recommendations and initiatives to reduce infant deaths. \n \nGrant funds cover a percentage of the costs of the team managing the project at CelebrateOne- Director of Data Management, Senior Project Manager and partial funding of the Senior Manager for Pregnancy and Perinatal Supports and at Columbus Public Health -- a Health Data Abstractor assigned to the Fetal Infant Mortality Review. In addition, funding will cover other operational expenses including but not limited to: office supplies, professional development, and mileage reimbursement for those staff members funded by this grant and grant extension. \n \nEmergency Measure: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency to continue support of all activities for the Ohio Equity Initiative within the Columbus Public Health Department and the Office of CelebrateOne. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 is entirely funded by the grant from the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City Match. This ordinance extends the grant period to June 30, 2024 and adds $288,950.00 of grant appropriation to the Grant Number 402300.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Executive Director, Office of CelebrateOne, and Columbus Public Health, to accept a grant extension from the Ohio Department of Health in the amount of $288,950.00 for the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 Project through June 30, 2024; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $288,950.00 from the City’s General Government Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($288,950.00)\n  \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, $288,950.00 has been made available through the Ohio Department of Health to extend the original grant period through June 30, 2024 for the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate up to $288,950.00 from the Ohio Department of Health for the continued support of the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 Program; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend up to $288,950.00 to support the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 Program deliverables; and \n \nWHEREAS, funds will cover a percentage of the costs of the team managing the project, including partial personnel costs for Celebrate One and Columbus Public Health; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance is being submitted as an emergency so as to allow the financial transaction to be posted in the City’s accounting system as soon as possible to fund staff salaries and other services needed to fulfill the deliverables of the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 Program Grant; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of CelebrateOne and the Columbus Public Health Department in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Executive Director to accept these funds on behalf of CelebrateOne to continue support of all activities for the Ohio Equity Initiative, to allow for the timely financial transaction to be posted in the City's accounting system to fund staff salaries and other services needed to fill the deliverables of the Ohio Equity Initiative 2.0 Program Grant, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
