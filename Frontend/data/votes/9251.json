    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for the purchase of automobiles and light duty trucks, as well as associated up-fitting for the Departments of Public Safety, Development, Finance, Public Service and Recreation and Parks. The purchase orders for the vehicle purchases will be issued from Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) that have been previously established by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office. Additionally, associated vehicle up-fitting may be purchased through State of Ohio cooperative contracts pending approval by the Purchasing Office. In addition, this ordinance also authorizes the purchase of other related up-fitting which will be procured via the competitive bid process per Columbus City Code Chapter 329.\n \nIn accordance with the aforementioned, this ordinance authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders from various UTCs, including but not limited to, George Byers Sons Inc, (PA004790 & PA004948) for the acquisition of automobiles and light duty trucks by the Fleet Management Division for subsequent distribution to various city departments, Law and Order Technology, LLC (PA005823) for the purchase of computers and accessories, Parr Public Safety Equipment, Inc. (PA005485 & PA005547) for the associated purchase of police vehicle up-fitting, and Ricart Properties, Inc. (PA004555) for the purchase of used vehicles or any purchase agreement or vendor that may replace these service contracts. These vehicles are to be purchased as replacements for older, high mileage, high maintenance and out of life cycle vehicles currently in service and are more fuel efficient and will relieve the city of maintenance expenses. The current environment for purchasing from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) is unstable and characterized by extremely short order windows. As such, this volatility is requiring a high level of agility in procurement efforts.\n \nGeorge Byers Sons Inc, vendor#006008, PA004790 & PA004948 - Light Duty Trucks & Police Vehicles - expires 6/30/24\nLaw and Order Technology, LLC, vendor#040906, PA005823 - Computers & Access. - expires 4/30/2024\nParr Public Safety Equipment, Inc., vendor#001060, PA005485 and PA005547 - Safety Upfit Service & Emergency Lights UTC - expire 12/30/24 & 11/30/2024 respectively\nRicart Properties, Inc., vendor#004963, PA004555 - Pre-Owned Vehicles - expires 3/30/2024 \n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders from Ohio Department of Administrative Services (DAS) contracts, after approval of the Purchasing Office, for related up-fitting. Ordinance #582-87 authorizes City agencies to participate in DAS cooperative contracts.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for additional up-fitting needs in accordance with the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329 for up-fitting services not otherwise covered via the Parr Public Safety UTC or Ohio Department of Administrative Services contracts.\n \nThis ordinance also authorizes the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for price increases of previously ordered vehicles. These include but are not limited to vehicle model year change, increase in materials cost, freight charges for delivery, fuel upcharges or any other increased cost associated with the procurement of the previously ordered vehicle. \n \nThese companies are not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract as per the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance seeks authority to appropriate and expend $9,750,000.00 from the General Fund, Income Tax Set Aside sub-fund for the acquisition of vehicles and related up-fitting parts/services on behalf of City departments. $9,750,000.00 was budgeted in the Income Tax Set Aside sub-fund for the 2024 Citywide Vehicle Acquisitions. \n \nEmergency action is requested due to the instability of the automobile supply chain. The market volatility of all the OEMs continues with the ongoing shortage of chips and other critical supply line parts to produce vehicles. This limited availability is causing vehicle order windows to open and close, at random, with little to no notice. Therefore, emergency legislation is being requested so that orders can be placed as soon as possible. \n Title\n \nTo authorize the Finance and Management Director, on behalf of the Fleet Management Division, to establish purchase orders from previously established Universal Term Contracts (UTCs) for the purchase of vehicles for use by various city agencies and departments; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders from State of Ohio Cooperative Contracts for related vehicle up-fitting; to authorize the Finance and Management Director to establish purchase orders for additional vehicle acquisition or vehicle up-fitting needs in accordance with the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the appropriation of $9,750,000.00 from the General Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $9,750,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
