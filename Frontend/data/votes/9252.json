    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  The City and Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (dba Downtown Columbus, Inc.) have partnered together to put forward an application to Columbus City Council on March 19, 2024 to create a Designated Outdoor Refreshment Area or DORA in the Downtown and Franklinton areas. Creating the DORA will add to the vibrancy of our community and provide more opportunities for our Downtown and Franklinton businesses.  The DORA will be active seven (7) days a week from 11am to 10pm.  Downtown Columbus, Inc. has formed Center City DORA, Ltd. (the LLC) and will provide management and operations services in the DORA, in cooperation with the Franklinton Special Improvement District and Capital Crossroads Special Improvement District.  At this time, no additional City resources will be needed to operate the DORA. \nApproval of the DORA will allow participating bars, restaurants, and other vendors to sell alcoholic beverages in designated eco-friendly containers to patrons. Patrons will then be legally allowed to depart the establishment or site where the beverage was purchased and move freely around within the DORA with that beverage. The designated eco-friendly containers or labels will be provided by the LLC to the brick and mortar establishments or other approved outdoor vendors, such as for special events.\nAll vendors must still maintain required liquor permits to sell alcohol in accordance with state law. All property owners and establishments have the option of opting-out of participating in the DORA. In accordance with state law, patrons may only leave establishments with alcoholic beverages in the designated eco-friendly containers. Further, no outside alcoholic drinks are permitted-meaning only alcoholic drinks that are purchased in the designated eco-friendly container and from a properly permitted vendor in the DORA may be enjoyed outside. Signage, as further described below, will inform patrons of the rules and boundaries of the DORA.\nThe DORA is being launched in cooperation with the LLC. The City will contract with the LLC in a supplemental memorandum of understanding to provide operations and managements services, including marketing, the production, maintenance, and distribution of signage throughout the DORA, as well as the distribution of the designated official container and labels. \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  Emergency action is requested in order to immediately allow for qualified license holders and businesses to prepare for the operational and maintenance needs of the new designated outdoor refreshment area.\n \nTitle\n \nTo approve an application of the Mayor for the creation of a designated outdoor refreshment area to be known as the “Center City DORA;” to designate the boundaries of the Center City DORA; to adopt a safety plan for the Center City DORA; to authorize the Mayor or his designee(s) to enter into a memorandum of understanding or other agreements with Center City DORA, Ltd. to provide for the operation and maintenance of the designated outdoor refreshment area; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”) Section 4301.82, municipal corporations are authorized, upon application by their executive officers, to designate certain areas within their borders as designated outdoor refreshment areas (“DORAs”); and\nWHEREAS, on March 19, 2024, the Mayor submitted a proper application pursuant to R.C.

Examples of signage designs are depicted in Exhibit C of the application.  \n \nSection 4. In accordance with R.C. Section 4301.82(F)(1)(c), the Center City DORA will operate seven (7) days a week from 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. In addition, the DORA may be operated during Special Events occurring within the DORA boundaries. \n \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Mayor or designee will retain the discretion to temporarily suspend the operations of the DORA or alter operational parameters at his or her sole discretion if determined necessary for public health, safety, or welfare. \n \nSection 5.
