    "description": "Explanation \n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into a LPA Federal Local-Let Project Agreement with the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) for the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project. This ordinance will also authorize the appropriation of grant and matching funds in conjunction with this grant agreement. The grant amount is $5,417,132.00 and the local match amount is $4,369,137.81. This ordinance also authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with Complete General Construction Company for the construction of the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project. The contract amount is $8,861,848.81, with a contingency of $800,000.00, for a total of $9,661,848.81. An additional $704,421.00 is being authorized for interdepartmental inspections and fees for this project. There is a total of $10,366,269.81 being authorized by this ordinance. \n \nIn 2018, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD) was awarded federal grant funding from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), administered by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), to assist towards construction construct the final 0.6 mile segment of the Olentangy Trail, from Northmoor Park to Clinton Como Park. The project’s grant funding is administered by ODOT under a Local Participation Agreement for Project PID 112036, as authorized by Ordinance 3524-2023. \n \nThe Columbus Recreation and Parks Department was also awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) Clean Ohio Trails Fund (COTF) in support of this project. The ODNR grant, in the amount of $435,000.00, with a local match of $145,000.00, was authorized by Ordinance No. 0129-2024. This $580,000.00 will also be used towards the construction of this project. \n \nThe Olentangy Trail is Central Ohio's most heavily used greenway trail. Recent trail count data shows over 1 million users per year travel on this trail. This central 0.6 mile segment of the 14 mile trail between Northmoor Park and Clinton Como Park was never completed. Currently, users must leave the trail and use a one mile signed on-street route. This route travels on five different streets and is widely recognized as difficult to navigate, congested, narrow, and unsafe. The route includes constricted sections where combined two-way car and trail traffic is on 11 foot to 13 foot wide pavement. This project will complete this final trail gap by constructing a crossing of the Olentangy River at Northmoor Park, traveling along the west bank of the river. At North Broadway Street, the trail will use an enhanced bike and pedestrian crosswalk and signal. The trail will then travel along the river behind the Ohio Health Campus. The trail will then continue south, strategically using boardwalks in environmentally sensitive areas, and cross the river to Clinton Como Park where it rejoins the existing trail. Construction is anticipated to start in the spring of 2024 and will be complete by the fall of 2025.\n \nVendor Bid/Proposal Submissions (ODI designation status):\n \nBids were advertised through Vendor Services and Bid Express, in accordance with City Code Section 329, on February 27, 2024, and received by the Recreation and Parks Department on March 19, 2024.

A public open house was held in 2021 with over 230 attendees. Over 450 comments were received via website, letters, emails, social media, and voicemails.\n \nArea(s) Affected:  Olentangy West (38), Clintonville, (39), Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation:  This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to existing trails from surrounding neighborhoods, business districts, and parks.
