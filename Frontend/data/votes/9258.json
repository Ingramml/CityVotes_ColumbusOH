    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a professional services contract with Warhol & Wall St Ltd to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the City of Columbus zoning code changes by creatively supporting the “Zone In Gallery”. \n \nIn April, the City of Columbus will introduce a proposal to modernize the zoning of Columbus corridors. This will be the city’s first comprehensive effort to update its zoning code in more than 70 years.  In order to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the code changes, the city is sponsoring the creation of a “Zone In Gallery”, the gallery is an interactive space where residents can learn: \n•                     Why our 70-year-old code is due for a change to match the needs of our growing city\n•                     The steps taken to develop a proposal for modernized zoning\n•                     What the proposed zoning would look like in their neighborhood\n•                     How the proposed zoning code updates will help build housing, grow use of transit, support new and existing businesses and more.  \n \nThe Zone in Gallery will be open six days a week during the proposal’s public comment period. \nWarhol & Wall St Ltd. began the creative development and fabrication (including educational displays, explanatory collateral, furniture rental and other supportive tasks to execute this concept) on the Zone In Gallery project as a sub-contractor to the Lisa Wise Consulting contract, originally authorized by Ord # 1041-2022, and the contract was later extended under the authorization of Ord # 0867-2024.  The scope of the gallery creation exceeds Warhol’s budgeted scope within the Lisa Wise Consulting contract.  \nThe purpose of this independent contract is to provide sufficient funds to execute the gallery, and to add permission to purchase food (snacks to be served to gallery attendees).  The authorization to purchase food and/or beverages for light refreshments is requested, in an amount not to exceed $5,000.00, which will serve the public for the purpose of community/partner engagement and participation.\nApproval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting January 1, 2024.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 018718 and contract compliance expires on 2/10/2025.\n \nWAIVER OF REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS: A waiver of the competitive procurement requirements outlined in Columbus City Code Chapter 329 is being requested because the vendor has already completed work as noted above, serving as a sub-contractor under the Lisa Wise Consulting contract, but will continue to do creative work for the project that will be funded under this Department of Development contract.  \n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency ordinance is necessary in order to continue the work that is already in progress, and emergency action is necessary to maintain stringent timelines for the public comments period and to avoid any disruption in services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding of $50,000.00 is available within the General Fund.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a professional services contract with Warhol & Wall St Ltd in an amount up to $50,000.00 from the general fund to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the City of Columbus zoning code changes; to authorize expenditures prior to the Purchase Order; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Columbus City Codes; to authorize the payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City undertook an independent analysis of the Zoning Code and process, which determined that the current code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city; and\n \nWHEREAS, an updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Building and Zoning entered into a contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, for the provision of professional consulting services, authorized by Ord # 1041-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Building and Zoning modified the original agreement with Lisa Wise Consulting to extend the contract term, authorized by Ord # 0867-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, in April, the City of Columbus will introduce a proposal to modernize the zoning on Columbus corridors. This will be the city’s first comprehensive effort to update its zoning code in more than 70 years; and \n \nWHEREAS, in order to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the code changes, the city is sponsoring the creation of a “Zone In Gallery”, and will be open six days a week during the proposal’s public comment period; and\n \nWHEREAS, Warhol & Wall St Ltd began the creative development and fabrication (including educational displays, explanatory collateral, furniture rental and other supportive tasks to execute this concept) on the Zone In Gallery as a sub-contractor to the Lisa Wise Consulting contract ; and\n \nWHEREAS, the scope of the gallery creation exceeds Warhol & Wall St Ltd’s budgeted scope within the Lisa Wise Consulting contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, the purpose of this independent contract is to provide sufficient funds to execute the gallery, and to add permission to purchase food (snacks to be served to gallery attendees); and\n \nWHEREAS, it has been determined that it is in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding requirement to ensure that work can continue, to avoid any disruption in services, and to permit expenses incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into contract with Warhol & Wall St Ltd as the work is already in progress and emergency action is necessary to avoid any disruption in services, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
