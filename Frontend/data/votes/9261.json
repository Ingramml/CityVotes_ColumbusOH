    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into contract with K.N.S. Services Inc. and MCIS, Inc. for the Neighborhood Safety Cameras Project.  K.N.S. Services, Inc. will provide labor and installation services for the neighborhood safety cameras to be placed in the public right-of-way abutting the Southpark Apartments complex.  MCIS, Inc. will provide engineering and labor services to deliver wireless communications in support of these new camera sites. \n \nThe Neighborhood Safety Cameras Project has been a successful policing strategy for the City of Columbus. The Division of Police uses these cameras as a tool to increase their ability to monitor criminal behavior and provide safety in our neighborhoods.  Neighborhood selection is driven by crime data, input from police officers, infrastructure, potential impact on criminal activity and, most importantly, neighborhood support. During the most recent twelve month reporting period, there were 923 Calls for Service to the Southpark Apartments, including twenty-six Felony Offenses of Violence and three Drug Overdoses.  The City of Columbus brought a nuisance abatement lawsuit against Southpark in 2022.  As a part of the agreed order that resulted from that lawsuit, the owners of the complex have made a significant investment in the safety infrastructure on their property.  Installing safety cameras in the right-of-way abutting Southpark will significantly enhance that investment and increase the safety and quality of life of the residents.\n \nBID WAIVER:  K.N.S. Services Inc. and MCIS, Inc. are the current vendors for the Neighborhood Safety Cameras Project and have the specialized knowledge and experience needed to install and connect these new cameras.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION:  The contract compliance number for K.N.S. Services Inc. is CC005443 and expires 2/22/25.  The contract compliance number for MCIS, Inc. is CC009642 and expires (pending update).\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $200,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Safety G.O. Bonds Fund, Fund 7701. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget is required, along with a transfer of cash and appropriation, to establish sufficient budget authority for this project and to align spending with the proper project.\n \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriation within the Safety G.O. Bonds Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into contract with K.N.S. Services Inc. and MCIS, Inc. for the Neighborhood Safety Cameras Project; to waive the competitive bidding requirements of Columbus City Code; and to authorize the expenditure of $200,000.00 from the Safety G.O.

Bonds Fund, for the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a bid waiver is necessary for this project due to the specialized knowledge and experience of our current Neighborhood Safety Cameras project vendors, K.N.S. Services Inc. and MCIS, Inc.; and\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Safety to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into contract with K.N.S.
