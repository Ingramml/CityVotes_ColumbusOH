The existing radio hardware has become obsolete and replacement parts are no longer available. In addition to the equipment obsolescence, a future highway flyover will be built over or near the existing radio tower and will cause radio interference. This construction contract will provide the following: 1) A connection from the Dodge Park Pump Stations to existing City fiber to provide redundant communication to the Sewer Maintenance Operations Center (SMOC); and 2) Upgraded Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and radio system equipment for the following locations: Sanitary Pump Station SA-13 (Dodge Park), Stormwater Pump Stations ST-22 (Long & Hocking), ST-1/1A (Mound & Sandusky), ST-23 (Long & Neil), and ST-26 (Dodge Park), Greenlawn Floodwall, Rich St. Floodwall, Biofilter 5, Biofilter 6, and the Alum Creek Storm Tank.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be substantially complete in a manner acceptable to the City within 500 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.  Final Completion is 530 days from the date of NTP.

This system of radio equipment informs maintenance staff of any problems at remote sanitary and stormwater facilities which would cause Water-in-Basement (WIB) events or overflows to area streams and rivers.\n \nThis contract replaces equipment in kind.
