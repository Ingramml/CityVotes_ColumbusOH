    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance is submitted to City Council in response to an application to establish an Agricultural District within the City of Columbus. The Agricultural District designation was created by the Ohio General Assembly and is governed by Chapter 929 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). The five-year designation provides certain protections to farmers against utility assessment, nuisance civil actions, and land appropriation. Courtright Investment Company, LLC has filed an application for renewal for a 10.4 acres tract (010-118507) located at 4270 Groves Road. All properties are actively farmed. The application was received by the City Clerk’s Office on March 13, 2024. The ORC requires that the City hold a hearing to consider the designation within 30 days of receiving an application. A hearing was held on April 12, 2024 at which there was no opposition to the applications. The ORC further requires that City Council act on the application within 30 days of the hearing. This application would provide one new designation. The Administration has reviewed the application and determined that they meet the provisions of the ORC and recommends that they be approved.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThe designation of an Agricultural District will have no fiscal impact.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo approve the application of Courtright Investment Company, LLC to designate 10.4 acres of farmland at 4270 Groves Road as agricultural districts pursuant to ORC Section 929.02.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, section 929.02 of the Ohio Revised Code provides for the designation of Agricultural Districts; and\n \nWHEREAS, an application to designate 10.4 acres of farmland (010-118507) as an Agricultural District has been filed by Courtright Investment Company, LLC and received by the City Clerk’s Office on March 13, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, a public hearing was held on April 12, 2024 at which there was no opposition to the application; and\n \n  WHEREAS, the Administration has reviewed the applications and determined that they meet the provisions set forth in the Revised Code and further recommends that they be approved; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSection 1.  That pursuant to section 929.02 of the Ohio Revised Code the application received by the City Clerk’s Office on March 13, 2024 of Courtright Investment Company, LLC to designate 10.4 acres of farmland (010-118507) as Agricultural Districts are hereby approved.\n \nSection 2.  That within five (5) days of the passage of this ordinance, the City Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to indicate Council’s action on the application(s) and send a certified copy of this ordinance by certified mail, return receipt requested, to: Courtright Investment Company, LLC \n PO Box 278 Lancaster Ohio 43130.
