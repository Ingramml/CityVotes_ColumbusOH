    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $150,000.00 of the 2020 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio for two single family home projects.  Each home will have its own set of agreements and each home will receive support in the amount of $75,000.00.\n \nHabitat for Humanity MidOhio (HFHMO) proposes to build two new single-family homes located at 1225 E 15th Avenue and 1560 Briarwood Avenue in the City of Columbus. The homes will be built to AWARE standards and are designed to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood.   HFHMO has received letters of support for these projects from the South Linden Area Commission (1225 E 15th Ave) and North Linden Area Commission (1560 Briarwood).\n \nThe home at 1225 E 15th Avenue will be a two-story home with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, and a full basement. The approved first-time homebuyer for this home is a single mother with one child, who earns below 80% of the Area Median Income.\n \nThe home at 1560 Briarwood Avenue will be a two-story home with 5 bedrooms, 2 baths, and a partially finished full basement. A family of 9 has been approved for the purchase of this home. They are first-time homebuyers earning below 80% of the Area Median Income. \n \nThe homes will be built on vacant property purchased from COCIC (1560 Briarwood) and the City of Columbus’ Land Bank (1225 E 15th). \n \nHFHMO has a 34 year history of creating safe, decent, affordable homeownership opportunities for low-and very-low-income families.  An affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, HFHMO has built, repaired, or rehabilitated more than 600 homes throughout their service area of Franklin, Madison, and Licking Counties. Their homes are typically sold to first-time homebuyers earning 30%-60% of the Area Median Income who are willing to partner with them by completing a homeownership education course and up to 200 hours of sweat equity work on their own home, as well as other Habitat homes. \n \nA unique aspect of the Habitat model is that they offer no-interest, no-profit mortgages to their buyers, making the homes affordable to families who would not qualify for traditional mortgages.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2021 Action Plan, per Ordinance 2345-2020.\n \nEmergency action is requested to allow for the developer to maintain the project schedule.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 004859 and expires 4/13/2023\n \nFiscal Impact: $150,000.00 is available from the 2020 HOME grant (G451903).\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $150,000.00 of 2020 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, and mortgage with Habitat for Humanity MidOhio in an amount up to $75,000.00 for 1225 E 15th Ave. and up to $75,000.00 for 1560 Briarwood; and to declare an emergency.
