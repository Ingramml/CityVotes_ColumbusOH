    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the YWCA Columbus, a registered trade name of The Young Women's Christian Association, a non-profit corporation, as operational funding in support of the Safe & Sound childcare program.\n \nThe Safe & Sound childcare program at the YWCA Family Center has provided safe, high-quality childcare to some of the community’s most vulnerable children for nearly twenty years. The programming operates at the highest Step-Up-to-Quality star rating, which is the result of small classroom ratios, numerous teacher certifications, and thorough performance measurements. Staff are specially trained with trauma-informed, social-emotional based practices so they can better serve children who may come with a wide range of negative social determinants.\n \nLike so many other childcare providers across the country, the YWCA has had to adjust to highly competitive wages to recruit and retain high caliber staff members - especially those with training in trauma-informed care. Because of specific classroom ratio requirements, staffing shortages lead to difficult decisions, such as turning away children and shrinking classroom sizes at a time that need has intensified. To avoid those situations, the YWCA Columbus is focused on the kind of staff supports that can decrease turnover, such as good healthcare benefits, childcare benefits, and a minimum $20-per-hour wage. This grant funding will allow the YWCA Columbus to offer workers at the childcare program a competitive wage and provide for a more sustainable program.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the YWCA Columbus in support of the Safe & Sound childcare program; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($250,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Safe & Sound childcare program at the YWCA Family Center has provided safe, high-quality childcare to some of the community’s most vulnerable children for nearly twenty years; and\n \nWHEREAS, like so many other childcare providers across the country, the YWCA has had to adjust to highly competitive wages to recruit and retain high caliber staff members; and\n \nWHEREAS, this grant funding will allow the YWCA Columbus to offer workers at the childcare program a competitive wage and provide for a more sustainable program; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with the YWCA Columbus in support of the Safe & Sound childcare program.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $250,000.00 within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That per the action authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $250,000.00 is hereby authorized per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That this ordinance shall take effect at the earliest date allowable by law.",
