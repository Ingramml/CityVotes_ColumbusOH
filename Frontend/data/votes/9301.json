    "description": "Explanation                     \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with South Side Learning & Development Center, dba SproutFive, a non-profit corporation to provide operational funding in support of their Family Resource Center.\n \nSince 1922, the South Side Learning & Development Center, dba SproutFive, has provided exceptional early childhood education in Columbus, Ohio. The mission of SproutFive is to ensure every child benefits from a holistic, high-quality early education. SproutFive’s vision is that all children are given the opportunity to thrive during their first five years of life, ensuring that every child and teacher is supported in a community-based early childhood program. \n \nThis grant will provide direct support to SproutFive families struggling to make ends meet by relieving overdue childcare costs. Childcare costs have only become more burdensome to families, as relief that was available in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has evaporated. Low-income families faced childcare costs that had not been factored into their budgets during the years of the pandemic. This grant will support SproutFive’s “bridge fund” to remove the financial burden of overdue childcare costs and provide additional temporary relief to families in need of financial support as they seek employment.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with South Side Learning & Development Center, dba SproutFive, in support of their Family Resource Center; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $20,000.00 within the Job Growth subfund.

That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with South Side Learning & Development Center, dba SproutFive, in support of their Family Resource Center, in an amount of up to $20,000.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the City Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $20,000.00 in the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  That the expenditure of $20,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1 of this ordinance, is hereby authorized in the Job Growth subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100015 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 6. That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
