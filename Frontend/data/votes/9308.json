    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 0798-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on March 21, 2024, to allow for a change of the type of contract from a “not-for-profit service contract” to a “grant agreement”. This will allow the city greater flexibility to provide CSB with advanced payments that will help the organization avoid delays in payment, particularly in winter months when there is a greater demand for their services.  \n \nOrdinance No. 0798-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on March 21, 2024, authorized the Director of the Department Development to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $5,409,650.00 to administer five initiatives to address homelessness in the City of Columbus and to authorize the payment of expenses starting January 1, 2024.\n \nTo increase the capacity of the funds provided to CSB, advanced payments are needed.  This change will resolve cash flow issues the organization has faced in Q4 of our fiscal year. This was not an issue the city was aware of when the ordinance was originally drafted. The city is not able to provide advanced payments under a not-for-profit service contract, so this request will amend the original ordinance to a “grant agreement”.  The authorization to purchase food and non-alcoholic beverages, as “operating costs” to serve the public purpose for populations experiencing homelessness, housing insecurity and food insecurity.\nEmergency action is requested in order to avoid any disruption of essential services to our vulnerable unhoused residents.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 0798-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on March 21, 2024, to allow for a change of the type of contract from a “not-for-profit service contract” to a “grant agreement”, to authorize the payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 0798-2024, passed by Columbus City Council on March 21, 2024, authorized the Director of the Department Development to enter into a non-profit service contract with the Community Shelter Board (CSB) in an amount up to $5,409,650.00 to administer five initiatives to address homelessness in the City of Columbus and to authorize the payment of expenses starting January 1, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, to increase the capacity of the funds provided to CSB, advanced payments are needed.  This change will resolve cash flow issues the organization has faced in Q4 of our fiscal year; and\n \nWHEREAS, this was not an issue the city was aware of when the ordinance was originally drafted.
