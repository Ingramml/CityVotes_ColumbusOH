    "description": "Explanation                     \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Our Community Group in support of their Break Bread Men's Wellness Series. \n \nThe mission of Our Community Group is to educate, mobilize, and empower African Americans in wellness, education, and economics. They strive to create a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals can thrive and reach their full potential. By offering resources, advocacy, and opportunities for growth, they aim to improve the overall quality of life for black people across central Ohio.\n \nThe Break Bread program is an integral part of the \"Brother to Brother\" initiative, aimed at addressing mental health challenges within the African American male community in Columbus, Ohio. This innovative program recognizes the unique needs of this demographic and offers a supportive environment where African American men can come together, engage in open dialogue, receive valuable education, and access group therapy facilitated by mental health professionals. Through the Three Ts: Talking, Teaching, and Therapy, this program aspires to foster a culture of emotional well-being, resilience, and empowerment among its participants. Up to $9,000.00 of food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses are authorized under this grant.\n \nBreak Bread meetings are scheduled to take place twice a month throughout the year, once virtually and once in person. This balanced approach ensures accessibility while allowing for the benefits of both virtual and in-person interactions.\n \nThe Break Bread Wellness Series will also have a Brother to Brother Men’s Summit which is a half-day summit comprising informative workshops, engaging keynotes, and community resources specifically focused on addressing the needs of Black Men. Attendees will complete a survey as well as a needs assessment and will have a success coach follow up with them to assist with referrals to appropriate resources, follow up programming, and track outcomes. \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Our Community Group in support of their Break Bread Men's Wellness Series; to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for residents; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
