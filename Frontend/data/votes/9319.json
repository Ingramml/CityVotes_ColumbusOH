    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Director of Public Service, to associate all General Budget Reservations resulting from this ordinance to pay for an increase in price for three (3) Peterbilt 348/ Galbreath Holtz Roll-off Hoist Trucks. This purchase was awarded through RFQ017103, and has been approved by the Division of Fleet Management.  \n \nThe purchase of these trucks was originally authorized by Ordinance 0488-2021, and awarded to ESEC Corporation dba Columbus Peterbilt, on the original purchase order (PO267486) confirmed April 8, 2021. However, effective October 30, 2021, ESEC Corporation dba Columbus Peterbilt was acquired by Ohio Machinery Co. dba Ohio Peterbilt (FID 34-0672363), and all existing orders for ESEC Corporation were to be transferred to Ohio Machinery Co. dba Ohio Peterbilt (Ordinance 2634-2021). PO267486 was cancelled, and a new encumbrance was established (ACPR002599). \n \nDuring the elapsed time between the initial order, and the upcoming delivery, surcharges in the amount of $194,375.70 have been applied to the original purchase price of $611,856.30 executed on PO267486, due to the increase of production costs associated with supply chain demands during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Public Service, and the Division of Refuse collection have approved the increase in price. The Purchasing Department will approve the surcharge increase contingent upon documentation provided by the vendor prior to the approval of this legislation. \n \nOhio Machinery Co. dba Ohio Peterbilt is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for Ohio machinery dba Ohio Peterbilt is CC006428 and expires 6/8/2024. \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT:\nFunding for this purchase is available within the Refuse Bond Fund, Fund 7703. It is necessary to amend the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget to transfer budget authority within the fund to align with the proper project. The funds are appropriated.\n \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is for an equipment purchase and is exempt from the MBE/WBE program. \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis ordinance is to be considered an emergency to meet the urgent need of replacing trucks that are currently unavailable due to mechanical repairs that are not cost effective or the vehicles are no longer operational. Also as explained in the Background section above, the acquisition of the vendor with whom the original purchase order was executed, required a new PO to be executed with the new vendor. Therefore, since the order will soon be arriving, it is urgent that a new PO with the increase for surcharges is established in order to pay for the increase in price. \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to associate all General Budget reservations resulting from this ordinance with Ohio Machinery Co. dba Ohio Peterbilt; to authorize the expenditure of up to $194,375.70 from the Refuse Bond Fund for the cost of surcharges; and to declare an emergency.
