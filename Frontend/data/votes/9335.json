    "description": "Explanation                     \nBackground:  This ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Tech Corps Ohio in support of their Hackathon event for under-served Franklin County high school students.\n \nThe mission of Tech Corps Ohio is based on the belief that all K-12 students should have access to high-quality computer science learning experiences, and this vision can be achieved through computer science programs, alongside partners and people in the technology space. Tech Corps Ohio’s work gives students the opportunity to make connections between the technology they love to use and the education and career pathways associated with the creation of this technology. Their programming also results in deeper learning and problem-solving for students, professional development for teachers, and an increase in high school students pursuing computer science and IT-related degrees or enrolling in IT training programs. \n \nThe Tech Corps Ohio hackathon will serve up to 150 Franklin County high school students, focusing on students traditionally underrepresented in technology. This includes black and brown students, students from low-wealth families, new Americans, and students from families without a history of higher education. Support from Columbus City Council will help fund marketing costs, prizes for students participating in the final hackathon event, and other supplies, services, and personnel costs. No funds will be used for the purchase of food or beverages.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Tech Corps Ohio in support of their Hackathon event; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $100,000.00 within the Job Growth subfund.
