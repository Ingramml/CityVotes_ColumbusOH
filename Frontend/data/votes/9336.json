    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation seeks to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $1,250,000.00 of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grants ($756,459.62 from the 2022 grant and $9,057.62 from the entitlement portion of  the 2023 grant) and $484,482.76 of program income from the 2023 grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute a commitment letter and loan agreement and authorizes the city to act as a lender and have a promissory note, mortgage, and restrictive convent executed for this project with Elevate 340 LLC., to construct Elevate 340 project.  The term of the agreement is 30 years with 1% interest.  \n \nElevate 340 is the newest high-quality, sustainable, and inclusive residential housing solution in Columbus’ downtown Discovery District. The development adjacent to Nationwide Children’s Hospital is an attainable housing apartment community.  This community will have a mix of 74 three, two, and one-bedroom family units. Fifty-five units are to be set aside for families at or below 60% of the AMI. Of the 55 low-income housing tax credit units, four are set aside at 30% AMI to serve the formerly homeless through Community Shelter Board referrals and rental assistance. Nineteen units are set aside as market-rate to bring together and create opportunity for the economically diverse Downtown workforce.\n \nThe Elevate 340 site is in a desirable neighborhood, rich in amenities and employment opportunities. Elevate 340 is uniquely positioned on the corner of Fulton and Grant between major employers including Nationwide Children’s Hospital, OhioHealth Grant Hospital, and Franklin University. The location provides close access to grocery stores, restaurants, childcare facilities, parks, schools, employment opportunities, health care services, and entertainment venues.\n \nThe building will feature five-stories with thirty-three secure on-site parking spaces and bike storage, onsite property management, a fitness room, and a large community room for residents. Elevate 340 will obtain LEED Silver green certification from the U.S. Green Building council rating system. \n \nElevate 340 received confirmation of its CRA eligibility for a 15-year 100% (building) tax abatement. Financing partnerships with the Ohio Housing Finance Agency, the City of Columbus, the Affordable Housing Trust for Columbus and Franklin County, the Franklin County Treasurer, the Columbus-Franklin Finance Authority, and Fifth Third Bank are instrumental to Elevate 340 and the creation of much needed affordable housing in downtown Columbus.\n \nFunding of the project will not close until the HUD required environmental review is completed.\n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2022 Action Plan per ordinance 2800-2021, the 2023 Action Plan per ordinance 3353-2022, and the 2024 Action Plan per ordinance 2993-2023.\n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 048374 and expires 3/12/2026.\n \nFiscal Impact: $756,459.62 is available from the 2022 HOME grant (G442102) and $493,540.38 is available from the 2023 HOME grant (G442202) comprised of entitlement funds and program income.  The commitment of funds through this legislation is conditioned on compliance with HUD’s environmental review requirements. The funding from HOME Fund (2201) is only authorized if all HOME review and comment requirements have been met prior to any commitment of funds, as approved by the Responsible Entity Agency Official. An Authorization to Utilize Grant Funds will be received by the City from HUD in advance of the execution of documents for this project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $1,250,000.00 of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grants ($756,459.62 from the 2022 grant and $9,057.62 from the entitlement portion of  the 2023 grant and $484,482.76 of program income from the 2023 grant) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute a commitment letter and loan agreement that authorizes the city to act as a lender and have a promissory note, mortgage, and restrictive convent executed for this project with Elevate 340 LLC., for the Elevate 340 project.
