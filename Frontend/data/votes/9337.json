    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Building and Zoning Services to modify and extend the professional services contract with RAMA Consulting Group, Inc. for the Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Assistance for the extension of the contract term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025.  The initial contract in May 2022 was for a 24-month period and was authorized by Ordinance 1044-2022.  Because the project was expected to extend beyond two years, the contract included two optional twelve-month extensions, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation. This extension authorizes the first of two extensions, with no additional funding.  \n                     \nThis effort is necessary to act on the findings of an independent analysis which determined that the City’s Zoning Code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city.  An updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth.  Collaborative action will be critical in this effort and RAMA will be assisting the City in the Communications and Engagement aspects of the effort, including measures to reach underrepresented constituencies. \n \nThe Department of Finance, Purchasing Office solicited Requests for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Bonfire portal from January 19, 2022 to February 16, 2022.  The evaluation committee, including representatives from the Building and Zoning Services and Development departments, assessed the proposal and determined that it was highly responsive.  A representative of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion served as an advisor to the process.  The Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized contract negotiations between the City and RAMA, which were successful.    \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  RAMA Consulting Group, Inc.'s contract compliance number is CC001370 and the expiration date is November 20, 2025.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency ordinance is necessary in order to extend the contract prior to its expiration on May 8, 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  There is no additional funding necessary for this ordinance.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Building and Zoning Services to modify and extend the professional services contract with RAMA Consulting Group, Inc. for the Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Assistance for the extension of the contract term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City undertook an independent analysis of the Zoning Code and process, which determined that the current code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city; and\n \nWHEREAS, an updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Finance, Purchasing Office solicited Requests for Proposals on behalf of the Department of Building and Zoning Services for the Zoning Code Update Communications and \nEngagement contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, RAMA Consulting submitted a responsive proposal as determined by the evaluation committee and the Building and Zoning Services Director subsequently authorized negotiations with the \nfirm; and\n \nWHEREAS, because the project was expected to extend beyond two years, the contract included two optional twelve-month extensions beyond the initial 24-month period, subject to Council reauthorization and additional funding allocation; and \n \nWHEREAS, it is now necessary to modify and extend the contract from the term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025, to allow RAMA Consulting Group, Inc. to continue its work on the Zoning Code update communication and engagement; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Building and Zoning Services in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify and extend the contract with RAMA Consulting Group, Inc prior to May 8, 2024, the current expiration date of the contract, for the preservation of the public peace, property, health safety and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of Building and Zoning Services be, and hereby is, authorized to modify and extend the professional services contract with RAMA Consulting Group, Inc. for the Zoning Code Update Communications and Engagement Assistance for the extension of the contract term end date of May 8, 2024 to May 8, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
