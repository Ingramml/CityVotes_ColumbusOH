    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with General Temperature Control, Incorporated, for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant EAC HVAC and Air Purification project, CIP #650372-100000, in an amount up to $7,583,290.00; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $7,585,290.00. \n \nThe HVAC & Air Purification Units in the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) East Aeration Building are approaching the end of their useful life and are becoming increasingly difficult to repair and maintain.  Furthermore, the current configuration is inefficient and overly complex.  The project consists of installing a new HVAC and air purification system according to the detailed plans and specifications set forth by the design engineer. This includes making necessary structural modifications to facilitate the system's installation, ensuring compliance with contemporary building standards, and integrating the system seamlessly with the facility's current Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, with the objective of achieving an upgraded, efficient, and fully functional system.\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 64, Far South.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 365 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $7,583,290.00, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                      $7,583,290.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                          $            0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                          $      2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                              $7,585,290.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project is necessary for replacement of failing HVAC and Air Purification systems at our facility.  Environmental benefits will likely be inherent in the project, because newly designed units will be more energy efficient.  No community outreach or input is believed to be necessary.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Southerly WWTP EAC HVAC and Air Purification project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 1/16/24 through 2/14/24.  One bid was received for the project and was opened on 2/14/24.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                                         Bid Amount        Compliance Number      ODI Status\nGeneral Temperature Control, Incorporated        $7,583,290.00               CC004830                    MAJ\n \nThe General Temperature Control, Incorporated bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $7,583,290.00.\n \nThe certification of General Temperature Control, Incorporated was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nGeneral Temperature Control, Incorporated’s contract compliance number is CC004830 and expires 3/18/26.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for

contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.  General Temperature Control, Incorporated anticipates using City-certified MBE/WBE companies for $3,332,088.00, or 43.9% of the contract dollars.  \nGeneral Temperature Control,

administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2767-2023, passed by Council on 10/30/23.  The loan is expected to be approved in May, 2024.  Funds will need to be certified against the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to proceed with this project until the loan has been approved.\nFunds will need to be appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, transferred to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, and then appropriated in the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the WPCLF and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to reflect the loan funding for this project. \nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into
