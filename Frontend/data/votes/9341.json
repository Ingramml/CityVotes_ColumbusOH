and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal.  This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.\n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThese contracts are expected to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2767-2023, passed by Council on 10/30/23.  The loan is expected to be approved in May, 2024.    \n \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary System Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund, Fund 6111, in the amount of $16,799,258.08 is needed to fund this proposed expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as a loan is executed with the Ohio EPA to reimburse the Sanitary System Reserve Fund.  The funds will need to be appropriated in Fund 6111. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget will also be necessary.  These funds will need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nThis project is being undertaken to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) rebate being offered to energy communities and municipalities. Under the available IRS guidance, the City of Columbus will be eligible for a rebate up to 50% of the construction cost. According to our current construction cost estimate, this project would be eligible for approximately $90 million in rebates. However, to obtain this rebate, this project must meet what the IRS is calling the “Beginning of Construction” deadline. This deadline is currently set to December 31, 2024. This means that this project must either have 5% of the construction cost paid to the Contractor (5% Safe Harbor) or must have substantial construction begin and continue through the completion of the project (Substantial Work Test). The rebate amount will be reduced if the deadline is missed. Emergency legislation is being requested to aid in meeting these deadlines. The pre-construction procurement of this equipment will allow for the City to meet the “Substantial Work Test” portion of the “Beginning of Construction” activities through significant fabrication of the digester mixing system.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to establish contracts with Unison Solutions, Inc., Boiler Tech, Inc., Olympus Technologies, and Hydro-Thermal Corporation for the purchase of equipment to be utilized in the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Organics Receiving and Bioenergy Utilization Facility for the Department of Public
