The work will consist of, but not limited to, providing labor, materials and equipment for installing, repairing and removing electric transmission, distribution and street lighting systems, such as setting poles, installing equipment, underground cable, wire conductors, providing emergency services during power outages, poles down, cable hits, weather events, vehicle accidents, vandalism and other emergencies that will require the successful bidder to respond and provide services when contacted by the City of Columbus, Division of Power, twenty four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week, three hundred sixty five (365) days per year.\n \nDue to the need for a quick response time and emergency services, the bid specifications required bidders to submit extensive utility electrical experience, a list of experienced employees, safety records, a list of available equipment that will be necessary to complete the jobs and the dielectric testing log for the equipment for safety purposes.\n \nFunds in the amount of $2,000.00 will also be encumbered with the Department of Public Service for Prevailing Wage Services.\n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids for Emergency & Non-Emergency Services for Electric Transmission, Distribution & Street Lighting Systems in accordance with the relevant provisions of Section 329 (RFQ027041). Three hundred and thirteen (313) vendors were solicited (18 EBE, 2 EBE/MBE, 1 EBE/WBE, 241 MAJ, 26 MBE, 2 MBE/VBE, 4 MBE/WBE, 1 VBE, 18 WBE). Eleven (11) bids (1-not registered in Vendor Services, 9 MAJ, 1 WBE) were received and opened on March 27, 2024.  \n \nAfter a review of the bids, the Division of Power has determined:\n \nIntren, LLC was the lowest overall bidder, however, they did not submit the required experience information. The pricing is only valid through December 31, 2024, per the bid specifications, pricing was to be valid through the end of the contract. Therefore, they have been deemed non-responsive. \n \nHilscher-Clark Electric Co was the next lowest overall bidder, however, they failed to meet the bid specifications by not providing pricing on equipment deemed necessary to complete the services and by not providing a list of qualified employees, an equipment list and the dielectric testing for the equipment which were a requirement of the bid specifications, therefore, they have been deemed non-responsive.\n \nState Line Construction and Maintenance, LLC was the next lowest overall bidder, however, they failed to meet the bid specifications by not providing a list of qualified employees and experience, an equipment list and the dielectric testing log for the equipment which were a requirement of the specifications. Therefore, they have been deemed non-responsive.\n \nHydaker-Wheatlake Co was the next lowest overall bidder, however, they failed to meet the bid specifications by not providing a list of qualified employees and experience, an equipment list and the dielectric testing log for the equipment which were a requirement of the specifications. Therefore, they have been deemed non-responsive.\n \nNew River Electrical Corporation was the next lowest overall bidder and met all the specifications of the bid. Therefore, the Division of Power recommends an award be made to New River Electrical Corporation as the most responsive and responsible bidder. \n \nThe contract will be in effect for one year from the date of execution with the option to renew for four additional one year periods. If unforeseen issues or difficulties are encountered that would require additional funding, a modification would be required.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION: The Department of Public Utilities respectfully requests the legislation be deemed an emergency due to multiple recent weather events in the last few weeks and the need to have essential services restored in a timely manner.\n \nSUPPLIER: New River Electrical Corporation, vendor #009173, expires 12/22/24, majority status\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.   \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $1,698,000.00 is budgeted and needed for this purchase. \n \nThe following amounts were spent for this service:\n$1,158,520.61 was spent in 2023\n$1,699,947.96 was spent in 2022\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with New River Electrical Corporation for Emergency & Non-Emergency Services for Electric Transmission, Distribution & Street Lighting Systems for the Division of Power and to provide for payment of prevailing wage services to the Department of Public Service, Design and Construction Division; to authorize the expenditure up to $1,698,000.00 from the Power Operating Fund; and to declare an emergency.
