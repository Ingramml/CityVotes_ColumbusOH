    "description": "Explanation\n \nE-bikes are electric bicycles with a motor that gives riders a boost. E-bikes are a low-cost, energy efficient, climate-friendly form of transportation. E-bikes use rechargeable batteries and travel up to 28 mph. When you use an e-bike to get around, you can: \n•                     Save thousands of dollars per year on fuel and maintenance by replacing daily car trips with e-bike rides \n•                     Bike greater distances and across harder terrain \n•                     Set aside worries about arriving sweaty at your destination \n•                     Reduce your carbon footprint while running errands or commuting to work\nIn addition to creating low-cost, affordable transportation, e-bikes also provide climate-friendly transportation and will help Columbus reach its Climate Action Plan goals by reducing the carbon footprints in the Columbus community. \nIn July of 2023, the City launched the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program and provided vouchers for residents who were interested in purchasing an e-bike. Residents applied for the program and, once selected to receive a voucher, were able to redeem the voucher at the point of sale and the bike shop would in turn receive that money. This program was wildly successful with over 1300 applicants within 24 hours; nearly 70% of the vouchers have been claimed and redeemed. \nAs a result of this success, this ordinance authorizes additional funding to support the cost of additional vouchers for the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program by entering into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus, LLC, a nonprofit entity, that will issue vouchers for resident purchases of e-bikes in accordance with the Program parameters.\n \nCity Council has previously authorized the then Director of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus twice, under Ord. 3548-2022 and Ord. 2872-2023, for the administration of an e-bike pilot program.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Interim Director of the Department of Public Service to enter into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus, LLC in an amount up to $500,000.00 for the Resident E-bike Subsidy Program to continue the creation of multimodal transportation options for residents that reduce the carbon footprint in Columbus and support our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure in the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund and to declare an emergency. ($500,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, creating multimodal forms of transportation is paramount; and\n \nWHEREAS, e-bikes serve as a low-cost, affordable form of transportation compared to single-occupancy vehicles; and\n \nWHEREAS, encouraging mode shift away from single-occupancy vehicles toward electric modes of transportation assists in lowering our carbon footprint; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is the goal of Columbus to be carbon neutral by 2050; and\n \nWHEREAS, an e-bike subsidy programs helps low-to-moderate income individuals access transportation choices that might be otherwise unavailable; and\n \nWHEREAS, this program provides vouchers for residents who are interested in purchasing an e-bike. Residents will need to apply for the program and once selected to receive a voucher, they would be able to redeem the voucher at the point of sale and the bike shop will in turn receive that money; NOW THEREFORE, and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation in the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to pass this ordinance because Smart Columbus requires ample time to release program vouchers in waves over the course of several months to accommodate retail partners, and it is paramount to schedule these waves as soon as possible over the course of the City’s clement weather to most effectively engage residents for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety; now, therefore:\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Interim Director of the Department of Public Service is hereby authorized to enter into a grant agreement with Smart Columbus, LLC in an amount up to $500,000.00 for the Resident E-bike Subsidy program to continue the creation of multimodal transportation options for residents that reduces the carbon footprint in Columbus and supports our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.\n \nSECTION 2. That the Auditor is hereby authorized and directed to appropriate $500,000.00 to the Department of Public Service within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, in Other Expenditures-05 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That per the action authorized by Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $500,000.00 or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 5. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6. That this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.\n \nSECTION 6. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or 10 days after its passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
