    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify an existing professional services contract with Heart and Hunter Inc. doing business as Hunter Marketing.\n \nOrdinance 0403-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract for the Park Columbus Educational Communications Campaign providing the City of Columbus, Division of Mobility & Parking Services with a comprehensive stakeholder outreach campaign highlighting innovative parking projects in 2022, including the installation of multi-space parking meters and the launch of the Dynamic Curb Lane Management Program. Ordinance 0719-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the aforementioned contract to add additional funds to support the provision of stakeholder outreach services in 2023. The Division of Mobility & Parking Services now wishes to modify the existing service contract to support the provision of services in 2024. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended:                                          $250,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                                    $250,000.00                      (PO315867, Ord. 0403-2022)\nThe total of modification 1:                                                                                     $250,000.00                      (PO376675, Ord. 0719-2023)\nThe total of modification 2:                                                                                    $250,000.00                     (Total this Ordinance)--_______      \nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $750,000.00\n \n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen:\nThis is a planned contract modification for the purpose of continuing the Park Columbus Educational Communications Campaign. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:\nHeart and Hunter has knowledge and experience with this specific stakeholder outreach, bidding the work out would add more costs and time to the completion.\n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract.\n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Heart and Hunter Inc. is 035651, which expires April 13, 2025.\n \n3. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $250,000.00 is available within Fund 6500, the Mobility Operating Fund, to support this expenditure.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract modification is not subject to City of Columbus MBE/WBE/SLBE program requirements because the original service contract was executed prior to the implementation of this program. However, Heart and Hunter Inc. is a certified WBE, and the proposed expenditure will count towards the Department’s overall goal. \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to modify a service contract with Hunter Marketing relative to the Park Columbus Educational Communications Campaign; and to authorize the expenditure of $250,000.00 from the within Fund 6500, the Mobility Operating Fund.
