    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing design and construction agreement with the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation (CDDC) for the administration of the Bicentennial Park Scioto Mile Fountain Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $160,000.00. \n \nThis modification includes installation of special event electric service in Bicentennial Park. CDDC will manage the work through a change order on the existing design and construction agreement in place for the fountain improvements. This modification will provide for the design and construction of the additional electric improvements throughout the site to be used for events. These improvements will focus on safety and provide electrical access to the special events section. It will also minimize the expenses of event electric distribution charges.  \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department recognizes the benefit that the Bicentennial Park Scioto Mile Fountain Improvements Project will have on residents by continuing to provide an important downtown riverfront attraction available without admission to the families of the community. \n \nThe Recreation and Parks Department will reimburse CDDC upon completion of this modification, up to $160,000.00. The total of $160,000.00 includes a $20,000.00 contingency to account for unexpected underground conditions and obstacles.

The project will provide a new interactive fountain, along with additional seating capacity for people to enjoy the fountain. Additionally, this modification will install a permanent electric distribution system, which will allow for more robust events. \n \nCommunity Input/Issues: CDDC has conducted a public process for downtown Columbus which included this area.
