How cost of modification was determined:\nCost proposals were provided by Osborn Engineering based upon established contract job titles, pay rates for those job titles, and allowable expenses.  The final cost was determined through negotiations between the Division of Water and Osborn Engineering.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project will address miscellaneous safety needs at various Division of Water facilities to improve employee working conditions and reduce the potential for employee injuries.  Most improvements will occur within secure areas that are not accessible to the public; for these projects no community outreach activities are anticipated.  Community outreach activities will be considered for improvements that occur within areas accessible to the public, but at this time, outreach is not expected to be needed.  \n \nThe consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying the Department of Public Utilities environmental management system (EMS) to the construction projects.\n \n3.
