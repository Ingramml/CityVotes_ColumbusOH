    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a professional services contract with Murphy Epson Inc for the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project, CIP 650004-100005, in an amount up to $629,060.00, to pay for continuation of services.\n \nThe services provided in the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project consist of: supporting the implementation of Blueprint Columbus in multiple project areas; educating and informing residents about Blueprint Columbus and the problem being addressed; providing adequate notification and keeping residents in project areas apprised of work being performed in their neighborhood; advising the City regarding residents’ concerns; and providing training or additional support for contractors and City field and other staff as needed.\n \nThe Community Area for this project is “99-Citywide” since the project spans more than one Community Area.\n \n1.1 Future Renewals/Modifications:  The original contract projected needing services through 2032.  Modifications are anticipated every few years to add funds to continue services.\n   \n1.2 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $629,060.00\n      Original Contract                                                                                          $368,118.00 (ORD 3172-2021; PO308187)\n                     Renewal No. 1                                                                                          $499,758.75 (ORD 0801-2023; PO379528)\n                     Modification No. 1 (current)                                                                                    $629,060.00 (current)\n                     Future Modifications (Estimated amount)                                             $2,021,181.25                                                               \n                     TOTAL ESTIMATED COST                                                                                       $3,518,118.00\n \n1.3 Reason other procurement processes are not used:  This contract was bid and awarded through the City’s RFP process as a multi-year contract with several modifications planned to add funding.  Another procurement process is not required.\n \n1.4 How the cost of modification was determined:  Pricing was developed using current contract job titles, rates, and allowable expenses, with the final cost negotiated. \n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nAdministration of the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project contract ensures community input is received and utilized to design the best solutions for unique neighborhood needs. Not only does this help Blueprint develop comprehensive solutions for our community, it also helps create an efficient process that reduces excessive costs resulting from engineering redesigns and time frame extensions associated with addressing resident concerns through a less formal process.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nMurphy Epson Inc’s contract compliance number is CC-004934 and expires 01/26/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Murphy Epson Inc is classified as a WBE company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Murphy Epson Inc plans to use one subconsultant that is ODI certified as a majority company.  Murphy Epson plans to perform $331,280.00 of the work on this contract, so 52.6% of the work will be performed by a WBE.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Murphy Epson Inc has proposed the following subcontractor to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                           City/State                      ODI Certification Status \nD&D’s Policy Works, LLC                           Columbus, Ohio                             MAJ\n \nThe certification of Murphy Epson Inc and the above company was in good standing at the time the contract was modified.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund is also needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested so funding can be added to the contract before work has to stop due to the contract being out of funds.  Contract dollars are running low due to unexpected delays with the negotiations of the contract modification with the vendor.  A stoppage in this contract work will threaten consent order deadlines for Blueprint projects as the Blueprint projects require community involvement and neighborhood engagement provided by this contract for the design and construction of the Blueprint projects.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase a professional services contract with Murphy Epson for the Blueprint Columbus Public Information Outreach Project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Sanitary Bond Fund; to authorize an expenditure of up to $629,060.00 from the Sanitary Bond Fund to pay for the contract modification;
