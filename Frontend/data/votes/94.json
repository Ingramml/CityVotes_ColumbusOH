    "title": "To enact new Chapters 1914 and 1915 of the Columbus City Codes pertaining to the activation of body-worn cameras and the rendering of first aid by the Columbus Division of Police.",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe purpose of this ordinance is to enact new Chapters 1914 and 1915, pertaining to the use of body-worn cameras and establishing requirements for the rendering of aid by Columbus Division of Police officers.  \n \nEarly on the morning of December 22, 2020, Andre Hill, a Black Columbus resident, was shot by a Columbus police officer who had not activated a body-worn camera to record the incident.  In the minutes that followed, neither the police officer that fired on Mr. Hill nor his partner rendered any medical aid to Mr. Hill.  Several minutes passed before emergency medical services were even requested.  Andre Hill died at the hospital over a half hour following the shooting.  \n \nGiven these events, it is imperative to strengthen rules surrounding the use of body-worn cameras and requirements to render aid; not only in policy, but also in law.  So Council is proposing the following changes to the Columbus City Codes: \n•                                          * Requiring the activation of body-worn cameras during any enforcement action or other situation outlined in the directives of the Columbus Division of Police\n•                                          * Require Police to request aid from emergency medical services upon a use of force that results in serious bodily harm, as well as the rendering of medical aid under certain circumstances.  Also, requiring police officers to obtain regular recertification to render aid.\n \nThose who violate these new chapters can be subject to discipline, per City policy and applicable collective bargaining agreements.  However, in egregious cases, where the behavior evidences a reckless disregard for the express requirements of the new chapter pertaining to rendering aid, the City may pursue remedies beyond discipline, including the filing of criminal charges against violators for dereliction of duty.\n \nCity Council is proposing these changes to promote accountability and to assure the safety of all Columbus residents.  This action further contributes to Council’s efforts to reimagine public safety in the City.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo enact new Chapters 1914 and 1915 of the Columbus City Codes pertaining to the activation of body-worn cameras and the rendering of first aid by the Columbus Division of Police.\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, early on the morning of December 22, 2020, Andre Hill, a Black Columbus resident, was shot by a Columbus police officer; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus Police officer that fired at Andre had not activated his body-worn camera prior to the shooting, only turning it on afterward; and \n \nWHEREAS, in the minutes that followed, neither the police officer that fired on Mr. Hill nor his partner rendered any medical aid to Mr. Hill, and several minutes went by prior to any request for emergency medical services; and  \n \nWHEREAS, Andre died at the hospital over half an hour after being shot; and \n \nWHEREAS, the shooting of Andre Hill follows the tragic deaths of several other young Black men at the hands of law enforcement, including Casey Goodson, Jr. and Kareem Ali Nadir Jones; and\n \nWHEREAS, though there are currently some Police directives pertaining to activation of body-worn cameras, as well as mentions of rendering aid, the City has determined that additional safeguards are necessary to ensure the proper use of these cameras and the rendering of necessary medical aid; and \n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance will enact new Chapters 1914 and 1915 in the Columbus City Codes, putting in code parameters for the activation of body-worn cameras and rendering of medical aid in such circumstances; and\n \nWHEREAS, in egregious cases involving the reckless disregard for the express requirements of the new chapter pertaining to rendering aid, the City may pursue remedies beyond discipline, including the filing of criminal charges against violators for dereliction of duty; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance will be known as Andre’s Law, to keep these terrible events in the City’s memory and go toward preventing similar tragedies in the future; and\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance furthers Council’s efforts to reimagine public safety in the City of Columbus, as additional accountability is crucial to its success; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \n \nSECTION 1.
