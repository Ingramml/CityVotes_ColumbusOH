    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: To authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (CFCFA) in the amount of $1,000,000.00 to administer a pilot program that will provide funding support to small-scale development projects for public improvements.\n \nSmall-scale development projects that rehabilitate vacant/underutilized properties are often burdened by unanticipated City-mandated public improvement requirements. The costs associated with these improvements can sometimes impose such a significant burden on a project budget that it can become unfeasible.  These small-scale investments are important to revitalizing the City’s commercial corridors and serving as catalysts for continued private investment.\n \nTo promote advancement towards City equity goals associated with business climate and neighborhood building, the City would like to support these types of projects by providing funding to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (“CFCFA”) for the administration of a neighborhood public improvements pilot program that will provide funding assistance to small-scale development projects with costs associated with unanticipated City-mandated public improvements.\n \nGrant funding will be advanced to CFCFA to fund the pilot program.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding in the amount of $1,000,000.00 is available through the Department of Development’s 2023 Capital Improvement Budget within the Development Taxable Bonds Fund, Fund 7739. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funds is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the program. The funding will need to be authorized for expenditure from Fund 7739.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 009436 and expires January 12, 2026.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Development Taxable Bonds Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Grant Agreement with Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority to provide funding for a neighborhood public improvements pilot program that will provide funding to support small-scale development projects in the City’s urban neighborhoods; and to authorize the expenditure of $1,000,000.00 from the Development Taxable Bonds Fund. ($1,000,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, small-scale development projects are essential to strengthening the City’s urban neighborhoods; and\n \nWHEREAS, these small, yet impactful, investments rehabilitate vacant/underutilized properties and contribute to a diversity of scale and building type along our commercial corridors and in the provision of diverse housing options; and\n \nWHEREAS, these developments are often burdened by unanticipated City-mandated requirements for public improvements that can make investment in these types of projects infeasible; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City desires to support small-scale investments that advance neighborhood building efforts and promote a business climate where every business has equal access to resources and opportunities to succeed through the provision of funding in the amount of $1,000,000.00 to the Columbus-Franklin County Finance Authority (“CFCFA”) for the administration of a pilot program that will provide funding for small scale development projects that need assistance with unanticipated City-mandated public improvement costs; and\n \nWHEREAS, the CFCFA will work directly with the City in order to determine project eligibility; and\n \nWHEREAS, grant funding will be advanced to the CFCFA to fund the pilot program; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to amend the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and transfer cash to align funding for project expenditures; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the CFCFA in an amount of up to $1,000,000.00 to administer a pilot program that provides funding assistance to small-scale development projects for public improvements, in the amount of $1,000,000.00; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
