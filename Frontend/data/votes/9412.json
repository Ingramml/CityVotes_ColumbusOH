    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with ParkMobile LLC relative to the ParkColumbus mobile payment application.\n \nOrdinance 0689-2023 authorized the execution of the original contract between the Department of Public Service and ParkMobile LLC to facilitate the performance of various professional and technical tasks necessary to the operation and maintenance of the Mobile Payment Application System commonly known as ParkColumbus, . This legislation seeks to authorize the encumbrance and expenditure of additional funding to sustain the ParkColumbus mobile payment application through at least March 31, 2025. \n \nAmount of additional funds to be expended: $1,200,000.00\nOriginal contract amount:                                                                                    $800,000.00                      (Ord. 0689-2023; PO398124)\nModification 1:                                                                                                                              $1,200,000.00                      (This legislation)\nTotal contract amount including all modifications:                     $2,000,000.00\n \nReason additional goods/services could not be foreseen: \nThis is a planned contract modification. \n \nReason other procurement processes are not used:  \nParkMobile LLC has been operating and maintaining ParkColumbus since its inception in 2019. Therefore, it is unlikely that seeking out and engaging another company to do so will result in significant cost savings for the City at this time. \n \nHow cost of modification was determined:\nCost associated with this modification are consistent with the rates established in the contract that was executed last year.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nParkMobile LLC’s contract compliance number is CC030903 and expires July 28, 2025.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this expenditure is available within Fund 6500, the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund.  \n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThe original contract for the Mobile Payment Application System was executed prior to the start of the MBE/WBE program, and this proposed contract modification also is exempt from this program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so that the requisite contract may be executed as soon as reasonably practicable so to avoid unnecessary disruptions in current on-street parking operations as the funds for the current contract only allow operation through the end of May\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Interim Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with ParkMobile LLC relative to the Mobile Payment Application System; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,200,000.00 from the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund to pay for an additional year of this contract; and to declare an emergency.  ($1,200,000.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance 0689-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with ParkMobile, LLC to facilitate the implementation, maintenance and continued operation of the Mobile Payment Application System; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing contract to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,200,000.00 to support the continued operation of the ParkColumbus mobile payment application as it is commonly known; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this legislation so that the requisite contract modification may be executed as soon as reasonably practicable so to avoid unnecessary disruptions in current on-street parking operations as the funds for the current contract only allow operation through the end of May, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the interim Director of Public Service be, and hereby is, authorized to enter into a contract modification with ParkMobile LLC of 1100 Spring Street NW, Suite 200, Atlanta, GA 30309, relative to the Mobile Payment Application System.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $1,200,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, is hereby authorized in Fund 6500 (Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund), Subfund 650001 (Mobility Enterprise), Dept-Div 5906 (Public Service - Parking Services), in Object Class 03 (Services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.  Funds are hereby deemed appropriated and expenditures and transfers authorized to carry out the purposes of this ordinance and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
