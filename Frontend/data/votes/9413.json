    "description": "Explanation\nBackground:\nOrdinance 1424-2023 authorized an appropriation and expenditure of $300,000 from the Neighborhood Initiatives fund and subfund 1000-100018, to the Department of Neighborhoods, to continue administration of the Neighborhood Beautification Program known as 614 Beautiful. 614 Beautiful is a program aimed at beautifying and unifying Columbus communities through place-based, public-facing improvements.\nThis ordinance is needed to modify PO404829 by extending the contract with Neighborhood Design Center through July 31, 2025. The current contract began on August 31, 2023 and runs through July 31, 2024. This extension will provide time for an additional round of beautification grant projects to be completed.\nIn compliance with Columbus City Code 329.09(a) this contract modification is necessary for the continuation of a beautification grant program that was established in 2022. In an effort to provide the most recent grant recipients a reasonable amount of time to complete their projects, a contract extension is being requested.\nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is required to modify and extend this contract.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to modify the contract with the Neighborhood Design Center by extending the contract through July 31, 2025.
