    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and transfer of $1,078,587.63 within the Recreation and Parks Grants Fund to reinvest funds secured by the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging as part of a service contract with CareSource for the provision of case management services for the Ohio Home Care Waiver (OHCW) program. \nAs of December 31, 2023, the agreement between the Central Ohio Area Agency on Aging and CareSource has expired. Thus, COAAA is no longer acting as the case management service provider for the OHCW program in Central Ohio. At the termination of the service contract, COAAA maintained the remainder of the unspent funds secured for providing case management services, which was $1,078,587.63. This ordinance authorizes COAAA to reinvest the remaining funds to support additional home and community-based services for older adults and people with disabilities in Central Ohio. \nFiscal Impact: \nThis ordinance authorizes the appropriation and transfer of $1,078,587.63 from the unencumbered cash balance of the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund. A transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund is needed to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $1,078,587.63 from the unencumbered cash balance of the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund for the provision of home and community-based services for older adults in Central Ohio; and to authorize the transfer of funds and appropriations between projects in the Recreation and Parks Grant Fund.
