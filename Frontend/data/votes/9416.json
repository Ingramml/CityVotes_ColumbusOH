    "description": "Background\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $350,000.00 with Choice Network, Inc. to support their Choice Center. \nChoice Network, Inc. (\"Choice\") is a not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to provide factual information, affirmative counsel, and barrier free support to pregnant people, people seeking to parent, and at-risk parents and their children - without judgment of their circumstances, identities, or choices. Choice Network specializes in working to ensure every family makes the best choice for themselves with the guidance of a trusted and objective team of professionals. Services offered for birth mothers include: a personalized adoption plan, counselor and support network available 24 hours a day, as well as grief counseling and support groups. Services provided for adoptive applicants include: application interview, home study, education and training, placement, pre and post finalization services, as well as pre and post counseling and support groups.\n \nChoice Network is coalescing their programs into the “JustChoice Center,” through which they can better counsel pregnant people in Franklin County and Ohio about their options and help those parenting on the margins. Unlike the ubiquitous Crisis Pregnancy Centers that trick and coerce pregnant people into keeping their pregnancies at all costs, the JustChoice Center will provide affirmative, factual counsel and tangible support whether their clients choose abortion, to place their child for adoption, or to parent - because they believe that reproductive freedom is a cornerstone of thriving families and thriving communities. \n \nChoice Network is also committed to public partnership and education. Their community advocacy group includes staff, community members, and volunteers. Additionally, Choice Networks partners with other local organizations and aid in coordination of events that help increase knowledge and awareness.\n \nNo public funds shall be used to subsidize abortion procedures and associated services such as anesthesia, laboratory tests, or hospital services as proscribed by RC §§5101.55 and 5101.56.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding of $350,000.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement in an amount up to $350,000.00 with Choice Network to support their Choice Center; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $350,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
