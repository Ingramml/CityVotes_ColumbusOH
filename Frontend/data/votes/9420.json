BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with AECOM Technical Services, Inc. for the Water Distribution System SCADA Improvements, Mod. #1, CIP #690522-100001, in an amount up to $1,699,708.93 for Division of Water.\n \nThis contract involves having a consultant evaluate SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system upgrade options and design state of the art improvements for the City of Columbus water distribution system.  SCADA system upgrades are needed on an approximate six-year cycle to keep hardware and software updated and ensure that the system functions reliably.\n \nThe initial funding for the contract was for preliminary design services.  This included a cyber security study, radio evaluation, SCADA system hardware evaluation, SCADA operating system evaluation, and graphics package upgrade evaluation.  This is the first of two planned contract modifications.  This contract modification will fund detailed design services.  The second planned contract modification will be for engineering services during construction.\n \nWater Distribution System SCADA Improvements project serves multiple planning areas so this project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $1,699,708.93\nOriginal Contract - Preliminary Design                                                   $485,538.62      (ORD 0093-2023; PO369398)\nModification No. 1 - Detailed Design                                                   $1,699,708.93   (current)\nModification No. 2 - Services during Construction      $250,000.00     (estimated)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                $2,435,247.55 (estimated)\n                     \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a planned contract modification as stated in the original authorizing legislation under Ordinance No. 0093-2023.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nAECOM Technical Services, Inc. provided a proposal as requested by the City based on the scope identified in the preliminary design work of the contract.  The cost was determined using existing contract job tiles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.  The final cost was negotiated between the City and AECOM Technical Services, Inc.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will determine the most economic approach to upgrading current SCADA system components.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nAECOM’s contract compliance number is CC-010897 and expires 6/22/24.   \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was assigned a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10.0% by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  The 10% goal is required to be met for the overall contract spend, including contract modifications.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, AECOM Technical Services, Inc. Engineers has proposed the following two subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nCDM Smith                                                                                         Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\nAdvanced Engineering Consultant                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \nThe certification of AECOM Technical Services, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds for this expenditure are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project.  A transfer of funds and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund will be necessary to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with AECOM Technical Services, Inc.
