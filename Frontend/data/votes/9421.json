    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1 project, CIP #650724-100000, in an amount up to $5,072,270.32.\n \nProfessional construction management services are needed to ensure construction of the Lower Olentangy Tunnel follows the requirements and specifications of the project design and that the City receives an end product capable of providing the intended function.  Existing City staff is not adequate to devote multiple qualified personnel full time to management of the project construction activities. These activities include full time construction inspection, project coordination, reporting, budgeting, scheduling, document tracking, and startup coordination.   Much of the project alignment generally follows Olentangy River Road.  This is a planned contract modification to add funds to continue the work.\n \nThe project is in the Citywide Community Planning Area #99.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $5,072,270.32\nOriginal Contract                                          $4,174,157.47 (ORD 0247-2020; PO221727) \n                     Mod.

No. 2                                          $4,933,165.65 (ORD 0761-2023; PO396061)\n                     Mod. No. 3 (current)                                          $5,072,270.32\n                     Mod. No. 4 (estimated)                                          $3,500,000.00\n                     Mod. No. 5 (estimated)                                          $   500,000.00\n                     TOTAL                                          $22,887,167.28\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded through the City’s RFP process as a multi-year contract with planned renewals to add funding until the construction project is complete.  Another procurement process is not required. \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work using established contract job titles, rates of pay, and allowable expenses.  City Project Manager and associated staff reviewed the proposal and negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe project is part of the Division of Sewerage and Drainage’s 2015 Blueprint program which included significant outreach for the program.  The project will improve water quality in the Olentangy River by substantially reducing wet weather overflows from seven combined sewer overflow structures as well as three other sewer relief structures. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  \nBlack & Veatch Corporation’s contract compliance number is CC008038 and expires 8/22/25.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Black & Veatch Corporation is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Black & Veatch Corporation anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of two City-certified MBE/WBE sub-consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 34.2%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Black & Veatch Corporation has proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nMarshWagner Inc.                                                            Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nAnser Advisory Management, LLC              Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    MAJ\n7NT Enterprises, LLC                                                                     Dublin, Ohio                                                                                    MBE\n \nThe certification of Black & Veatch Corporation and the above companies was in good standing at the time of the contract modification.\n \n 5. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized applying for these types of loans and the acceptance of the loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  \n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Black & Veatch Corporation for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Black & Veatch Corporation and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.\n   \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program, Fund 6124 in the amount of $5,072,270.32 is needed to fund construction for this project.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with the OWDA to reimburse the Sanitary Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in June 2024.  These funds will need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new fund. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with Black & Veatch Corporation for the Lower Olentangy Tunnel - Phase 1 project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the appropriation and transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund to the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund; and to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $5,072,270.32 from the Sanitary-Fresh Water Market Rate Program Fund for the contract.
