    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with RCC Global, LLC (RCC) for the Customer Information System (CIS) and Integrated Systems Upgrade Project. The project is expected to be complete sometime in 2026.\n \nDPU’s current CIS, Hansen’s Banner, was implemented in 1999. The CIS is used to calculate and generate bills. It includes the database that is the primary repository for all utility rates, fees, charges, service orders and customer information. As business requirements evolved over the years, DPU has added several custom programs, as well as workaround solutions to the existing platform which has significantly added to system complexity and operating risk. \n \nDPU implemented Oracle’s Customer Cloud Service (CCS) for meter data management in 2022 as part of the Enhanced Metering Project (EMP). AMI Meter installation is expected to continue through 2027.  \n \nNumerous custom integrations were created to sync meter data between Oracle’s CCS and Hansen Banner. It is challenging to manage the lifecycle of meters with two separate systems. Since DPU is already using Oracle CCS for meter data management and analyzed the functionality of the CIS side of Oracle CCS, DPU would like to implement the entire Oracle CCS solution, including Oracle Reporting and Analytics tools. Merging these systems into one platform should reduce system complexity, increase data and billing accuracy and make it easier to support the system into the future. In addition, similar benefits are expected with the implementation of Oracle Field Services (OFS), which is also developed by Oracle and built to integrate with Oracle CCS. OFS will replace DPU’s current Mobile Dispatching System, CGI’s PragmaCAD. \n \nA Customer Self-Service Portal, Electronic and Traditional Bill Presentment and Job scheduling software are components of the CIS Ecosystem that are critical to the success of this project.  \n \nPROCUREMENT:  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids through the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from October 13, 2023 to November 10, 2023 for this project in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code (RFQ026106). Four (4) bids, all by majority vendors, were received. The bids were deemed responsive and were evaluated on November 16, 2023. The Committee felt RCC Global, LLC submitted the strongest proposal overall for the following reasons:\n \n1.                     RCC Global, LLC presented the most thorough and logical project approach.\n2.                     RCC Global, LLC demonstrated a highly skilled project team, which includes numerous Oracle Certified resources.\n3.                     Project team provided thorough overall understanding of DPU needs and included a good plan for change management.\n \nIncluded in the RFQ was the request to perform an evaluation, selection and implementation of three components of the CIS ecosystem: Electronic and Traditional Bill Presentment, Customer Self-Service Portal and Job Scheduling Software. These were included in the RFQ because they are critical integration points with Oracle CCS and OFS. The selection process for these systems will be based on the vendor’s experience integrating with Oracle’s Utility Software solutions with Utilities that are similar to DPU. In addition, RCC Global, LLC will work with DPU to document and compile a Functional and Technical Capabilities Matrix to score the vendors.  \n \nAll of these systems must work together seamlessly and go-live simultaneously to avoid costly rework.  Contracting with RCC Global, LLC to implement the entire solution set helps to ensure we have a complete system at go-live and achieve the following goals:\n \n1.                     Evaluate and reengineer our existing business processes related to the CIS ecosystem by adhering to best practices and out of the box Oracle CCS and OFS functionality in order to reduce business process and system complexity.  \n2.                     Improve Customer Experience by providing a “One Stop Shop” customer portal for customers to obtain information, pay their bills, utilize self-service options etc. By providing more services online, DPU will also be reducing call center call volumes, reduce work redundancy and focus resources in more critical areas to increase operational efficiency.  \n3.                     Streamline existing integrations to reduce complexity in our CIS ecosystem.\n4.                     Implement Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions to help keep our CIS ecosystem current with more frequent technology and functional updates.  \n \nThe implementation project will include 3 phases:\n \n1.                     Vendor Selection, engagement and discovery\n2.                     Implementation of Oracle’s Utilities Customer Cloud Service (CCS), Oracle Field Service (OFS) and other software in the Oracle solution set. This phase also includes system integration support.\n3.                     Implementation of supporting systems to be determined by phase one, which includes traditional bill printing and electronic bill presentment, customer self-service portal and a cloud-enabled batch scheduler.  \n \n \nMINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM:\n \nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding. ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal. This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nRCC Global, LLC | EIN on file | D365 #048789 | Expires April 11, 2026\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$5,997,529.00 is available for this contract. It is about $2M over budget, but will be supported by forgoing or deferring other Computer Services’ related budget items.\n \n$0.00 was spent in 2023\n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with RCC Global, LLC for the Customer Information System (CIS) and Integrated Systems Upgrade Project; and to authorize the expenditure of $5,997,529.00 split among the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds.
