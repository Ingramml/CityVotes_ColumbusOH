    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Performance Pipelining, Inc., via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Blueprint Clintonville 2 Old Beechwold Lateral Lining project, CIP #650872-139161, in an amount up to $1,600,479.70; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $1,602,479.70.\n \nThis project involves the lining of sanitary laterals of 133 homes, approximately 5,800 linear feet, via “trenchless” methods using curing-in-place pipe (CIPP) technology, to prevent excess stormwater from entering the City's sanitary sewer system.  Trenchless pipe lining uses existing pipes to guide new and improved pipes into the sewage system.  Sewer lateral lining repair uses special sewage pipes that are flexible and able to fit inside existing pipes.  Once the new pipes have been pulled through, they are inflated and effectively replace the old pipes.\n \nNo future phases are expected at this time. This project is a Consent Order project. A Consent order is a negotiated agreement entered as a court order that is enforceable by the court. In 2005, the City of Columbus entered its Wet Weather Management Plan to the Ohio EPA to bring the City in compliance with its consent orders regarding the City’s sewer overflows. This project is an improvement identified in the Integrated Plan and the 2015 Wet Weather Management Plan Update Report.  The project is needed to mitigate water in basement events and sanitary sewer overflows to the goal of a 10-year Level of Service (LOS).\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance is 39, Clintonville.  \n \nTIMELINE:  All contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 300 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.  The Notice to Proceed is anticipated to be issued in June 2024.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $1,600,479.70, including a 15% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                        $1,600,479.70\nFuture Anticipated Needs                           $            0.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                           $      2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                               $1,600,479.70\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project is part of the 2015 Integrated Plan to address wet weather overflows from the sanitary sewer system.  This project will complete 1 of the 4 pillars for the Old Beechwold neighborhood, located in Clintonville, by rehabilitating the existing sanitary sewer laterals to prevent infiltration and inflow into the sanitary system from storm water.  There have been multiple public meetings with the neighborhood association over the past 2 years during the progress of the other work in the area.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Public Sanitary Sewers for Blueprint Clintonville 2 Old Beechwold Lateral Lining project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 01/16/24 through 02/14/24.  Two bids were received for the project and were opened on 02/14/24.  The following companies submitted bids:\n  \nCompany                                      Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\n1.
