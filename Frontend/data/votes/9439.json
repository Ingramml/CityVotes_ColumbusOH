This contract was most recently renewed by authority of ordinance 1103-2023, passed May 1, 2023. This contract will be for one year, starting on June 30, 2024, and ending on June 29, 2025 at a cost of $170,741.49. This contract will not automatically renew. However, there are three optional one-year renewals, subject to the mutual agreement of interested parties and the authorization of funds by City Council.\n \nThere were 6 responsive bidders to RFQ027044. The bid submitted by Brown Enterprise Solutions was the second lowest bid. However, with application of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion’s (ODI) incentive discount, Brown’s bid was the lowest responsive bid.
