    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: In 2014, the White House, under President Barack Obama, launched the My Brother’s Keeper (MBK) initiative to address persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential. Through this initiative, the Administration called on cities, businesses, and foundations to take important steps to connect young people to mentoring, support networks, and help them gain the skills they need to find a good job or go to college and work their way into the middle class. The milestones associated with the My Brother’s Keeper initiative include having young people enter school ready to learn, reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school ready for college, completing post-secondary education or training, successfully entering the workforce, and providing a second chance to those with past criminal offenses.
