($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Department of Public Service to enter into a construction administration agreement, and any future amendments or modifications thereto if needed, with the City of Canal Winchester (“Canal Winchester”) and to accept payment from Canal Winchester for the performance of construction administration and inspection services relative to the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6 project. \nThe aforementioned project encompasses various improvements to the stretch of Gender Road between Winchester Boulevard and Trillium Avenue, including installing a sidewalk and reconfiguring the US 33 ramp to permit safe pedestrian travel across the interchange and installing dedicated turn lanes from northbound Gender Road to the eastbound and westbound US 33 ramps. \nThe Ohio Department of Transportation (“ODOT”) previously awarded Canal Winchester a $2 million traffic-safety grant to facilitate the construction of the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6 project, which is slated to begin this summer. Canal Winchester recently determined that it is in its best interest to have the Department of Public Service to perform construction administration and inspection services necessary to the successful completion of the project. This legislation seeks to authorize the Department of Public Service to execute a construction administration agreement with Canal Winchester and to accept payment from the same for said services. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nUnder the terms of the construction administration agreement, Canal Winchester will pay the Department of Public Service for performing construction administration and inspection services during the completion of the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6. The estimated cost of those services is $380,103.00. \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow the parties to execute the requisite construction administration agreement as soon as reasonably practical so as not to delay the start of construction, which is slated to begin this summer. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Department of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to accept payment from the City of Canal Winchester for the performance of construction administration and inspection services relative to the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6 project; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2022, Canal Winchester received a $2 million traffic-safety grant from ODOT to facilitate the construction of the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6 project, which is slated to begin this summer; and \nWHEREAS, the aforementioned project encompasses various improvements to the stretch of Gender Road between Winchester Boulevard and Trillium Avenue, including reconfiguring the US 33 ramp to permit safe pedestrian travel across the interchange and installing dedicated turn lanes from northbound Gender Road to the eastbound and westbound US 33 ramps; and \nWHEREAS, Canal Winchester desires to have the Department of Public Service to perform construction administration and inspection services necessary to the successful completion of the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6 project; and \nWHEREAS, this legislation seeks to authorize the Department of Public Service to execute a construction administration agreement with Canal Winchester and to accept payment from the same for said services; and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the passage of this legislation in order to allow the parties to execute the requisite construction administration agreement as soon as reasonably practical so as not to delay the start of construction, which is slated to begin this summer, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Department of Public Service, acting through its Director, be and hereby is authorized to enter into a construction administration agreement, and any future amendments or modifications thereto if needed, with the City of Canal Winchester and to accept payments from the same for performing construction administration and inspection services necessary to the successful completion of the Gender Road Improvements Phase 6 project. \n \nSECTION 2.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
