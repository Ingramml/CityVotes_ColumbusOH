The project commenced construction in 2019 and construction is expected to continue for several more years.  The funds encumbered by this ordinance will be available for use on current and future phases of the project.\n \nOrdinance 2066-2019 authorized the Director of Public Service to grant consent and propose cooperation with ODOT relative to the Roadway Improvements - I-70/71 South and East Freeways project and to expend $8,200,000.00 to defray the cost of anticipated construction and inspection services necessary for the completion of the project.  Ordinance 0556-2020 authorized the encumbrance and expenditure of funding in the amount of up to $625,315.00 to support anticipated utility relocation, construction, and inspection costs in current or future phases of the project.  That ordinance also authorized the Director of Public Service to execute agreements, including any future amendments or modifications thereto, if needed, with ODOT to advance the construction of the needed public infrastructure improvements.  \n \nThere are additional phases planned for this project which will need funding.  Funding needs in excess of the amount encumbered with this ordinance for the current project phases and for future phases of the project will be submitted for Council consideration with future ordinances.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this project is available in the Streets and Highways Bond Fund, Fund 7704, in an amount of up to $4,650,000.00.  A transfer of appropriation is necessary to establish funding in the proper project.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to allow ODOT to maintain the planned project schedule and to promote highway safety. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the transfer of appropriation within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund;
