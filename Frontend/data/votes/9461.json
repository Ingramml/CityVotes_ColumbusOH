    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into a grant agreement with End the Violence in support of their community violence intervention program.\n \nEnd the Violence (ETV) is a crisis management and intervention organization that leverages the widely-recognized “credible messengers” approach to stemming violence before it escalates. ETV utilizes a team of community-based interventionists to provide alternative activities for residents who may otherwise engage in criminal and/or violent activity. ETV’s goals are to engage underserved hotspots in a culturally-informed manner, provide close-to-home work opportunities with pay, and to expose residents to opportunities for sustainable employment paying a living wage. In addition, ETV interventionists provide continuity and connections to supportive services to residents needing additional ongoing assistance.\n \nThis funding is expected to support community interventionists working throughout Columbus neighborhoods, as well as the funding necessary to support the activities that engage youths and residents most at-risk of engaging in violence. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The funding of $500,000.00 is available within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is requested in order to immediately disburse funds in time for the summer months in order to address neighborhood violence in Columbus.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into a grant agreement with End the Violence in support of community violence intervention; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure of $500,000.00 within the Public Safety Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
