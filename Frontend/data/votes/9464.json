    "description": "...Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City possesses title to a storm sewer easement described and recorded in Instrument Number 201910280142988, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio (“Easement”). The Easement burdens real property located in the vicinity of the intersection of Central College Road and Ulry Road (“Servient Estate”) currently owned by Asherton Grove Condominium Association, an Ohio non-profit corporation. The City’s Department of Public Service (“DPS”) has obtained a new easement as part of its Northeast MOU - Central College Road Ulry Road Reconstruction Project (440106-100000) and as part of that acquisition has reviewed a request by the owner of the Servient Estate to vacate a 2.480 acre portion of the existing Easement and determined, along with City’s Department of Public Utilities (“DPU”), that a portion of the Easement is no longer needed as a new 4.002 acre storm sewer easement was granted in Instrument Number 202402140015383 covering most of the same area. DPS and DPU have determined that terminating the City’s rights to the 2.480 acre portion of the Easement does not adversely affect the City and should be granted at no monetary cost. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Not applicable.  \n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Not applicable.\n \n...Title\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to execute those document(s) necessary to release a 2.480 acre portion the City’s storm easement rights described and recorded in Instrument Number 201910280142988, Recorder’s Office, Franklin County, Ohio.
