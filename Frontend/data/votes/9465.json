    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify the contract with RCC Global, LLC (RCC) for managed and project services related to Oracle’s customer cloud service meter data management system (Oracle CCS) that supports the Department of Public Utilities’ (DPU) Enhanced Meter Project. The term of the modification will be from date of execution through June 30, 2025. This legislation also authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify past outstanding, present and future contracts and purchase orders with Red Clay Consulting Inc and authorizes the assignment of all past outstanding, present and future business done by the City of Columbus from Red Clay Consulting Inc, vendor #033208 (FID on file) to RCC Global, vendor #048789 (FID on file)\n \n \nIn 2019, DPU initiated the Enhanced Meter Project (EMP) and awarded Sensus, a subsidiary of Xylem, a contract to install smart meters, implement the Sensus Regional Network Interface (RNI) head-end system to collect meter reads, and implement Oracle’s CCS meter data management system. RCC was the subcontractor that was responsible for implementing Oracle’s CCS. RCC is a partner with Oracle Utilities and Oracle Cloud, with specializations in multiple Oracle Cloud services.\n \nThe meter data management system is live in production and various system integrations are complete. Due to departmental resource constraints, DPU wished to continue receiving professional and managed service support from RCC for Oracle CCS and Ordinance 1212-2023 authorized DPU to waive competitive bidding and enter into a contract for these services. Under the proposed contract modification, RCC will continue its focus on CCS production issue triage, submission of Oracle product service requests including their escalation, and providing manual regression analysis, along with manual and automated testing of CCS product releases prior to deployment to DPU’s Oracle hosted environments. These services are intended to avoid quality of service impacts to DPU customers that may arise during the mass meter deployment period.\n \n1.   Amount of additional funds: The total amount of additional funds needed for this contract modification #1 is $918,432.00. Total contract amount including this modification is $1,819,402.00\n2.   Reason additional funds were not foreseen: The need for additional funds was known, expected and budgeted for.\n3.   Reason other procurement processes were not used: While other vendors provide support for Oracle CCS, because RCC provisioned, configured and implemented DPU’s meter data management system, they are the only vendor who can provide the necessary support for the system configurations and processes related to the City’s meter data management\n4.   How was cost determined: The cost is based upon estimated requirements for 2024 and a vendor quote for those requirements.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nRCC Global, LLC | EIN on file | D365 #048789 | Expires April 11, 2026\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$918,432.00 is budgeted and available for this contract.\n \n$227,492.50 has been spent in 2024\n$447,312.00 was spent in 2023\n$0.00 was spent in 2022\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the contract with RCC Global LLC for managed and project services related to Oracle’s customer cloud service meter data management system; to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify past outstanding, present and future contracts and purchase orders with Red Clay Consulting Inc, to authorize the assignment of all past outstanding, present and future business done by the City of Columbus from Red Clay Consulting Inc to RCC Global; and to authorize the expenditure of $918,432.00 split among the Electricity, Water, Sanitary Sewer, and Stormwater Operating Funds.
