    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with numerous non-profit organizations (see Exhibit A attached to this ordinance) in support of grassroots, community-oriented events and services.\n \nColumbus City Council seeks to provide support to small, grassroots, community-oriented organizations through small, high-impact grants for programs that directly serve neighborhoods and communities in Columbus. A grant process was established to reach these organizations and achieve this goal.\n \nThe following criteria were established. All grants shall be in support of community-oriented events or services. No individual grant agreement shall exceed $20,000.00.  Grants shall be paid out at two points in time to grantees, 50% in advance and 50% after the first tranche is spent or after the first three months of the grant term. All grantees must be not-for-profit organizations as defined in City Code 329.01(ff).\n \nMany of the programs serve youth and other community members who are food insecure or otherwise host events with food-related costs. Therefore, this grant authorizes up to $50,000.00 of food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses.\n \nAn application for the grant was published on the City Council website. City Council received 35 applications for the grant program. A review committee read all of the applications and scored them on a scale of 0 to 50 based on four criteria:\n \n•                     Alignment with City Council’s priorities of furthering: Affordable and Quality Housing, Good Jobs and Training, and Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods\n•                     Provision of a direct service or benefit to local community members\n•                     A clear plan and budget in place for the proposed program/event\n•                     A plan to ensure that the community will be made aware of the program/event\n \nFollowing an evaluation period and conversation, the committee narrowed down the group of top-scoring organizations for funding based on their geographic location, to ensure that a variety of neighborhoods and communities would be reached by the program.\n \nThe thirty five requests totaled approximately $625,000.00 across all proposals. Sixteen non-profit organizations were recommended for the $250,000.00 in available funding. Sixteen non-profit organizations will be awarded funding in this ordinance. \n \nEmergency Justification:  Emergency action is requested as it is immediately necessary to appropriate funds for necessary expenditures which will begin in June.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with numerous non-profit organizations to support grassroots, community-oriented services and events; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($249,845.00) \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, Columbus City Council seeks to support small not-for-profit community organizations providing services on a grassroots level to their local neighborhood; and\n \nWHEREAS, the grants program seeks to support not-for-profit organizations whose programs align with City Council’s three priority areas in 2024 including safe and healthy neighborhoods, affordable and quality housing, and good jobs and training; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into numerous grant agreements with local not-for-profit organizations for the purpose of supporting grassroots, community-oriented events and services, totaling $249,845.00; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Clerk in that it is immediately necessary to transfer and appropriate funds for necessary expenditures starting in early June; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
