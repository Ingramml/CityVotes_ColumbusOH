The City of Columbus lacks the human resources to provide for the services that are the subject of this contract. \n \nFiscal Impact: This ordinance authorizes the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the General Fund for this contract.\n \nContract Compliance: The Ohio State University, CC 006163, exp. 03-29-25\n \nEmergency action is requested to avoid any delay in providing critical assistance and support as it relates to violence prevention and the reduction of gun violence in the community.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention to enter into a not-for-profit service contract with The Ohio State University to assist the Office with identifying evidence-based practices to address overarching violence prevention strategies in our communities; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency ($150,000.00).\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Violence reduction and prevention technical assistance is needed to assist with identifying evidence-based practices to address overarching violence prevention strategies; and\n \nWHEREAS, these best practices will be used to develop a Strategic Plan in combination with an Evaluation and Monitoring Plan that will include indicators to track progress and make necessary changes if applicable; and\n \nWHEREAS, OVP will be performing this work with the support of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Evaluation Studies (HOPES) at The Ohio State University; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Office of Violence Prevention in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to enter into a contract with The Ohio State University to avoid any delay in providing critical assistance in the reduction and prevention of violence in our communities, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Office of Violence Prevention is hereby authorized to enter into a service agreement with The Ohio State University.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the expenditure of $150,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed in regard to the action authorized in Section 1, is hereby authorized from the General Fund 1000 in Object Class 03 per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3.
