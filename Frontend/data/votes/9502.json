    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to renew a contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC for licenses, maintenance and support for Tableau software. Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence software that provides instantaneous insight by transforming data into visually appealing and interactive visualization. It helps the user to see and understand the data quickly and find patterns that otherwise may be very difficult to detect and understand. Tableau connects to almost every database and its resulting visualizations can be easily shared with others both on and off City’s web pages. \nOn June 23, 2022, RFQ022015, a solicitation for Tableau maintenance and support, was opened. There were three bids submitted. Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC submitted the lowest, responsive bid. Two other bids were received in response to this solicitation. Communication Square and SHI submitted bids of $150,615.00 and $154,371.63, respectively.\nOrdinance 1937-2022, which authorized the original contract with Brown Enterprise Solutions, LLC, included a provision to renew for three additional one-year terms.
