    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The need exists to amend the City of Columbus Job Creation Tax Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) between the City of Columbus (“City”) and ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “Grantee”).  Columbus City Council (“Council”), by Ordinance No. 1492-2014, passed on July 21, 2014, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into an Agreement with the Grantee that granted a non-refundable tax credit allowed against the tax imposed under Section 362.06, “Income Subject to Net Profit Tax” of the Columbus City Codes of sixty-five percent (65%) of the new income tax revenue received by the City for a calendar year from New Employees, commencing January 1, 2015 and for ten (10) consecutive years thereafter (i.e., January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2024 for a 10-year credit). The Grantee committed to invest a total capital expenditure of approximately $80.5 million, which included $42 million in new construction, $15 million in leasehold improvements, $11.6 million in furniture and fixtures, $10.8 million in machinery and equipment, and $1.1 million in stand-alone computers to construct a three-building campus to house its corporate associates for its Alliance Data Retail Services.  Additionally, the Grantee committed to create 700 net new full-time permanent positions with an annual payroll of approximately $52.5 million, and retain 1,300 full-time associates with an estimated payroll of $124.4 million (the “Project”) at an undeveloped site near Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219 (the “Project Site”).  The Agreement was made and entered into effective November 4, 2014.  \n \nIn a letter from the Grantee received by the City on February 16, 2024, and through additional correspondence, the Grantee confirmed that its legal name changed from ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. to Bread Financial Payments, Inc. noting that the company had changed their name effective March 23, 2022. Additionally, the Grantee is requesting that the Project Site be updated to reflect the Grantee’s current location. At the time of construction in 2014, only one street address and parcel number existed. Upon completion of the aforementioned Project, the Project Site evolved into additional street addresses and parcel numbers that were not part of the original Project, but now houses the Grantee’s corporate associates as part of their three-building campus at Easton. \n \nAs a result, the Grantee is requesting the Agreement be amended to (1) change the company’s name from ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. to Bread Financial Payments, Inc. and (2) change the Project Site in the Agreement from Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219 to 3075, 3085, and 3095 Loyalty Circle, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel numbers 010-294116, 010-294117, and 010-295705.      \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to amend the Agreement for the first time to (i) remove ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. as Grantee and to be replace with Bread Financial Payments, Inc. and (ii) to revise the Project Site from Easton Square Place, Columbus, Ohio 43219, to 3075, 3085, and 3095 Loyalty Circle, Columbus, Ohio 43219, parcel numbers 010-294116, 010-294117, and 010-295705.  This legislation is presented as 30-day legislation.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNo funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to amend the City of Columbus Job Creation Tax Credit Agreement with ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. to remove ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc. as the Grantee to be replaced with Bread Financial Payments, Inc. as Grantee; and to revise the Project Site; and to amend Ordinance No. 1492-2014.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus (“City”) entered into a Job Creation Tax Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) with ADS Alliance Data Systems, Inc.
