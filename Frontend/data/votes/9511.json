    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City established the Stelzer-Stygler Community Reinvestment Area (CRA) in 1986 to stimulate private investment and job creation.  In 1994, changes in the CRA law placed additional obligations on municipalities to compensate school districts for lost revenues arising from tax abatements.  In May 2002, the City entered into a Compensation Agreement with the Gahanna-Jefferson School District to compensate the District for revenues from real property taxes forgone due to abatements on parcels in the Stelzer-Stygler CRA.\n \nThe present legislation authorizes the payment of $96,455.16 to the Gahanna-Jefferson City School District as the compensation due in 2024 for tax year 2023. This sum is calculated using the definitions in the Compensation Agreement and is based on one parcel (520-250987) in the Gahanna-Jefferson School District area of the Stelzer-Stygler CRA with building improvements and CRA tax abatements.  The abatement for parcel 520-250987 commenced with tax year 2017 and will terminate in tax year 2026.\n \nThe total private investment subject to exemption in the new buildings constructed on this parcel was approximately $9,945,700.00 in 2023.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order for the City to make the $96,455.16 payment to the Gahanna-Jefferson City School District according to the schedule established in the Compensation Agreement.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The 2024 General Fund budget (citywide account) includes funding for this payment to the Gahanna-Jefferson School District.  An amount equal to 25 percent (25%) of the payment will be expended from the Income Tax Set Aside Subfund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to appropriate funds within the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund; to authorize the City Auditor to transfer $72,341.37 within the General Fund; to authorize the payment of $96,455.16 to the Gahanna-Jefferson School District to compensate for real property tax revenues forgone as a result of CRA tax abatements in the Stelzer-Stygler CRA; to authorize the expenditure of $96,455.16 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
