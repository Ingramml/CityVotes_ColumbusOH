The work performed to date for this project consists of installation of a dry detention basin, outlet structure, emergency spillway, access drive, and tree planting.\n \nOrdinance 0031-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract with Shelly & Sands, Inc. to fund additional work not anticipated during design and not covered by the 10% project contingency. Additional work included pumping costs due to encountering groundwater at a higher elevation than anticipated, additional clay liner costs associated with the higher ground water table, and additional fencing costs to completely fence in the property after it became apparent ATVs were accessing the site through the creek side.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $120,000.00\nThe original contract amount, no inspection:              $1,986,801.41     (PO312718, Ord. 0179-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1, no inspection:             $184,183.00     (PO368235, Ord. 0031-2023)\nThe total of Modification No. 2, no inspection:                             $120,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:        $2,290,984.41  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to allow additional resources for additional work related to pumping costs due to encountering groundwater at a higher elevation than anticipated during additional clay liner work associated with the higher ground water table, also includes installation of new bulkhead in 36” line.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt has been deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nCosts were obtained using actual cost force account records with applicable markups as agreed by contractor and project staff.\n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Shelly & Sands, Inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Shelly & Sands, Inc. is CC006043 and expires 1/29/26.\n \n3.  Pre-Qualification Status\nShelly & Sands, Inc. and all proposed trades subcontractors have met Code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated for this modification within the Streets and Highways Bonds Fund, Fund 7704.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project. \n5.
