    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with ms consultants, inc. to add additional funds for design on the Roadway - Stormwater Design General Engineering contract.\n \nOrdinance 3241-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with ms consultants, inc. for the Roadway - Stormwater Design General Engineering contract.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources for engineering services for the design and investigation of regional stormwater basins and roadway drainage improvements. This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $115,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $150,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $650,000.00     (PO364723, Ord. 3241-2022)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $115,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:             $765,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary in order to authorize the environmental services and monitoring work required to obtain final acceptance from Department of Sewers and Drains (DOSD) on the Parsons Avenue Basin.  Due to issues with the existing high water table, we are unable to achieve permanent stabilization on the bottom 1-2’ of the constructed Parsons Avenue basin. DOSD will not provide final construction acceptance until complete stabilization is achieved. This modification will provide the necessary funding for the design, environmental, and monitoring services that ms consultants, inc. will complete in order to achieve the required stabilization.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nms consultants, inc. is the original designer of the Parsons Basin and has all of the historical information on the project. The environmental work required also needs to be completed within a certain window this June/July, and such bidding this out separately would not allow for that schedule to be met.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against ms consultants, inc.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for ms consultants, inc. is CC006998 and expires 12/1/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of cash is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.  Funds are appropriated.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 18% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner, to preserve the safety of the traveling public.  Additionally, the associated environmental work needs to be completed within a window this June/July 2024 - emergency legislation will be needed in order to issue a Notice To Proceed that allows for completion of that work within that window.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with ms consultants, inc. in connection with the Roadway - Stormwater Design General Engineering project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $115,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($115,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
