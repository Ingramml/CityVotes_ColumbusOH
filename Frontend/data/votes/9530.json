    "title": "To amend Ordinance No. 1442-2024, which was approved by Columbus City Council May 20, 2024, to correct three organization names listed in an attachment to the Ordinance; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1442-2024, due to two errors in the attachment to the ordinance identifying grant recipients.\n \nOne of the vendor names listed in the attachment was “Grove City United Methodist Church.” While this church is a recipient, their name was placed in the incorrect row due to a drafting error. This row should read “St. John’s Episcopal Church.” Additionally, an organization provided notice to the City on May 20th, after the deadline for amendments to legislation for the May 20th Council agenda, of a change in their selection of which non-profit entity would receive grant funds. Therefore, “Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., Columbus (OH) Alumni Chapter” must be changed to “Columbus Kappa Foundation.” Lastly, \"St. Mark's United Methodist Church\" should read \"Grove City United Methodist Church.\" The legislation must be amended to allow execution of a valid agreements with the organizations.\n \nA spreadsheet titled “1442-2024 Awardees” is attached to this Ordinance and has been updated to reflect this amendment.\n \nEmergency action is requested as it is immediately necessary to appropriate funds for necessary expenditures beginning early this summer.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No additional funding is required.
