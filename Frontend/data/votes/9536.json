    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into contract with Sky Nile Consulting for support of the We Got US campaign.\n \nIn 2023, Columbus City Council and the NAACP teamed up on a new anti-violence campaign known as “We Got US.” We Got US is a campaign for civic engagement and involvement, asking residents to commit to creating a safer Columbus by taking the pledge:\n \nWe believe that everyone in Columbus deserves to thrive in a safe and secure environment, whether in their homes, at work, and especially in their communities. To achieve this we must collectively invest resources, time, and effort into supporting our communities, especially those who are most vulnerable and experiencing higher rates of crime. Together, we pledge to make a positive impact by:\n \nSetting a New Standard: We will not allow crime and gun violence to be the norm in Columbus. Instead, we commit to being responsible and accountable neighbors who uphold just laws and take ownership of our actions and choices. We will work to resolve conflict without violence.\n \nBuilding Stronger Neighborhoods: By actively participating in block watch meetings, engaging in conversations with our neighbors, and investing our time and energy in the youth of our community, we will play an integral role in enhancing our neighborhoods' safety.\n \nEmpowering Youth: Through our affiliations and professions, we will become mentors and Champions for the youth. By spending quality time with them, offering guidance, and being accessible, we provide unwavering support during their journey.\n \nResponsible Gun Ownership: As an example to others, we will lock up our guns in secure lockboxes, ensuring they are not accessible to unauthorized individuals, especially our young people. We will secure our homes and cars to protect us and our children.\n \nEnriching Opportunities: When the chance arises, we pledge to share enriching summer and after-school programs with young people we encounter to help them access opportunities for jobs, continuing education, and volunteer opportunities. By keeping our young people engaged and busy, we provide them with outlets that meet their needs\n \nSky Nile Consulting will provide marketing, awareness, and community engagement to advance the goals of the We Got US campaign. The campaign will focus primarily on digital execution with on-the-ground support. The goal will be to target at-risk Columbus neighborhoods and their surrounding communities to engage residents with the campaign, with a focus on storytelling. Sky Nile will also deploy newsletters, video content, social media content, yard signs, email marketing and more, with the goal to achieve 2,500 pledges.\n \nA bid waiver is requested for this contract. Sky Nile Consulting has extensive prior experience engaging the community in a manner that is consistent with Council's priorities. With the approaching summer months and the typical corresponding rise in neighborhood violence, there is a need to engage this campaign work immediately, and there is insufficient time to complete a complete competitive bidding process.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that Sky Nile Consulting can undertake critical communications activities in advance of the summer months.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into contract with Sky Nile Consulting for support of the We Got US campaign; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency. ($100,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, in 2023, Columbus City Council and the NAACP teamed up on a new anti-violence campaign known as We Got US; and\n \nWHEREAS, We Got US is a campaign for civic engagement and involvement, asking residents to commit to creating a safer Columbus; and\n \nWHEREAS, Sky Nile Consulting will provide marketing, awareness, and community engagement to advance the goals of the We Got US campaign; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the city Clerk's office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Clerk to enter into contract with Sky Nile Consulting so that the organization can undertake critical communications activities in advance of the summer months; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
