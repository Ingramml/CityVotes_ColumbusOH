    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:   This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Safety to modify a contract with TargetSolutions Learning, LLC in the amount of $3,401.97 to continue the Division of Fire's Distance Learning program.  Contract modification is necessary as a price increase occurred on January 22, 2024, the same date ordinance # 0169-2024 that authorized $175,648.00 for the Division of Fire to contract with TargetSolutions Learning, LLC was read by Columbus City Council.  The price increase was unforeseen and unknown by the Division of Fire prior to January 22, 2024, which resulted in authorization to contract and expend funds in an amount insufficient to fund and pay TargetSolutions Learning, LLC’s updated cost.  The increase in cost was determined by TargetSolutions Learning, LLC, the sole provider of their specialized proprietary software, and was based upon industry-wide inflationary cost increases.  Since 2008, the Columbus Fire Division has contracted with a computer-based training content provider for their Distance Learning Project.  The Fire Division's Distance Learning project was implemented to provide remote training in all fire stations via computer network.  A computer-based training content provider is used to continue to provide and implement training, scheduling, and logging of employee training history, as well as software updates and support for the Fire Division.  \nColumbus Fire contracts with TargetSolutions Learning, LLC to deliver online Fire and EMS continuing education, under the parent company Vector Learning.  Target Solutions is expandable and customizable, offering credentials tracking for many different specialties including DART, Haz-Mat, FAO, Investigator, Professional Standards, and ARFF training.  TargetSolutions can track and notify members plus add informative videos to help fire personnel members meet their fitness and nutrition goals, and is also being used to track performance measures and identify training deficiencies.  All Columbus Fire members are required by state law and the city to maintain the Firefighter, Fire Inspector, and EMS credentials.   Columbus Fire has been using the TargetSolutions training platform since 2008, and is not currently seeking a alternative to the current solution; the Fire Division has built out credentials for Recruit, Apprentice, EMS Officer, and In-Service Training on a platform that is available 24/7 to fire personnel from any computer or portable device.\nContract Compliance:  TargetSolutions Learning, LLC ~ 263827779 / Vendor 002494\n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency action is required so that Fire's Distance Learning Program can continue uninterrupted.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $3,401.97 from the General Fund, for the additional expense for this contract between the Columbus Division of Fire and TargetSolutions Learning, LLC for 2024.  Ordinance 0169-2024 authorized the expenditure of $175,648.00 for this service for 2024.  The Fire Division spent $167,301.00 in 2023, $153,735.00 in 2022, and $153,735.00 in 2021 for these services.  \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Public Safety Director to modify a contract with TargetSolutions Learning, LLC for computer-based distance learning services for the Division of Fire; to authorize the expenditure of $3,401.97 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($3,401.97)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Fire Division needs to modify the yearly contract with TargetSolutions Learning, LLC for computer-based distance learning services, including training content, implementation, scheduling, and history logging, as well as software updates and support; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Public Safety, on behalf of the Division of Fire, to modify a contract with TargetSolutions Learning LLC for the aforementioned services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Fire, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify a contract with TargetSolutions Learning, LLC for computer-based distance learning services so that Fire's Distance Learning Program can continue uninterrupted, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
