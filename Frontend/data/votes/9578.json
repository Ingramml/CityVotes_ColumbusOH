    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nThis legislation authorizes the City Treasurer’s Office to waive competitive bidding and enter into contract for IT staff augmentation services with the State of Ohio's IT Staff Augmentation Contract (state term schedule) with OST, Inc. or the current contract provider.\nThe City Treasurer’s Office is in the midst of transitioning its merchant services and gateway solution from Huntington Merchant Services and Fiserv (First Data) to JP Morgan Chase Bank.  Many City merchants employ the use of third-party software and services providers.  Such transitions are complicated and require much in the way of IT support such as project management, business analysis, or technical resources.  While JP Morgan Chase Bank provides technical expertise for its implementations, the Treasurer’s Office needs its own IT support for this citywide effort.\nThe City Treasurer’s Office reached out to the City’s Department of Technology (DoT) for technical expertise but DoT was unable to provide the support needed.  Some project resource needs are still to be determined and will be defined during discovery phase of product implementation.\nAs the market for technical expertise is competitive, the State IT Staff Augmentation Contract offers the best opportunity for the Treasurer’s Office to obtain this expertise. It is hoped that the addition of technical expertise will enable the Treasurer’s Office to provide assistance to City merchants for the forthcoming implementations as well as documentation of business processes, solutions assistance, problem-solving and other needed expertise.  The contract is competitive and, if the contract employee is needed on an ongoing basis, a contractor to direct hire is possible.\nIt is therefore in the City's best interests to authorize the City Treasurer to waive competitive bidding in order to enter into contract with OST, Inc., the current State of Ohio's IT Staff Augmentation Contract provider.\nEmergency designation is requested to permit the procurement of support for the City’s banking implementations without delay.  Delays in the procurement of these services affects the ability of the Treasurer’s Office to timely and effectively implement the merchant services for collecting revenue on behalf of the City and also can result in the risk of increased costs and time needed to complete the necessary and secure transition of these services.\nOST Inc. vendor 042892, contract compliance 522175314, expiration 8/31/2024\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Treasurer to enter into contract with OST, Inc., the current State of Ohio's IT Staff Augmentation Contract provider, as may be necessary to support the City Treasurer’s banking implementations and citywide merchant activities; to waive the competitive bidding provisions to enter into such contracts; to transfer funds within the City Treasurer’s 2024 budget to provide funding for the contract; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the general fund; and to declare an emergency ($150,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the City Treasurer to enter into contract with a consultant vendor as may be necessary to securely and effectively modernize banking services and replace an antiquated payment gateway.  Pricing for the consulting services will be obtained from state cooperative contracts, from vendors qualified to provide the necessary services; and\nWHEREAS, it is in the City's best interests to waive the competitive bidding provisions to enter into such contracts; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Treasurer's Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Treasurer to enter into contracts with OST (or the current contract provider) for Ohio IT staff augmentation for professional services related to the management of the citywide banking and gateway services, for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1. That the City Treasurer be and is hereby authorized to enter into contracts with OST Inc., the current State of Ohio's IT Staff Augmentation Contract provider, for Ohio IT staff augmentation for professional services related to the management of the citywide banking and gateway services.  Pricing for such services will be obtained from the state cooperative contracts.\nSECTION 2.  That City Council deems it in the best interests of the City to waive the competitive bidding provisions of the Columbus City Code and does hereby waive the same.\nSECTION 3. That the transfer of $150,000.00 is hereby authorized from within the City Treasurer’s 2024 general fund budget from personnel (object class 01) to services (object class 03) per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 4. That the expenditure of $150,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed is hereby authorized from the City Treasurer’s 2024 general fund budget per the account codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\nSECTION 5. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\nSECTION 6. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications with this ordinance.\nSECTION 7. That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
