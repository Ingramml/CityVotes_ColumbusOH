    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinances authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify the agreement originally authorized by ordinance 0417-2024.\nExperience Columbus is the county convention and visitors bureau and provides marketing services to increase tourism and convention business. Data has shown that for every dollar spent by Experience Columbus toward the organization’s marketing and promotion services, visitors spent $13.60.\n \nAt the same time, there is acknowledgement that familiarity with Columbus as a destination remains low outside of Ohio. Surveys indicate that those who are familiar with Columbus have a strong, positive perception of it, and that increasing familiarity and awareness of the city is critical toward positioning Columbus as an appealing leisure destination, and subsequently an attractive city to host conventions and other large gatherings.\n \nExperience Columbus intends to leverage additional funding to target singles and families within a 250-500 miles radius of the city. The organization will lean heavily on digital, paid social, video, and unique public relations activations. Additionally, Experience Columbus intends to increase the city’s presence at conventions, conferences, trade shows, and other events.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the general fund and the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund to support this modification.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide Experience Columbus with the resources necessary to immediately undertake marketing activities during summer, the busiest tourism months of the year.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Finance and Management to modify the agreement with Experience Columbus; to authorize a transfer of appropriations; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the general fund and the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
