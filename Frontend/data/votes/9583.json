Improvements will consist of converting the roadway to two-way traffic and needed widening to provide for a parking lane on the west side. Improvements include of new curbs, sidewalks, storm sewer, electric distribution relocation, and street lighting.  \n \nIn the course of effecting roadway improvements, it is sometimes necessary to relocate aerial utilities in the project.  Due to this project there is a need to relocate them at the City's expense and allow Bridgewell Resources LLC to acquire the utility poles needed for the project.  \n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE \nThe contract compliance number for Bridgewell Resources LLC is CC002964 and is currently inactive.  The contract compliance requirement will be fulfilled by the time council reads the ordinance. \n  \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this expense is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.
