The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $1,200,000.00.\n \nGender Road Park and McCoy Park are two different park parcels owned by the Recreation and Parks Department that are currently undeveloped. Gender Road Park is a 32 acre undeveloped parkland in the City’s South East Community. McCoy Park, along Harmon Avenue, is an underutilized greenspace of nearly 20 acres in the City’s Southwest Community. This project will provide professional services to develop improvements for Gender Road Park and McCoy Park. The project will involve master planning, conceptual design, construction oversight, and public engagement.  \n \nFor Gender Road Park, the consultant team will provide a report detailing the existing public recreational facilities in the surrounding three square mile area, conduct public engagement with the surrounding community, and conduct internal program discussions with staff to develop a high quality programming plan for the Recreation and Parks Department to utilize over the next decade of development as the design for this park is put together. The public engagement open houses held during the first phase of this project helped to develop a master plan for this park that includes a basketball court, a pickleball court, playground, walking trails, and a Frisbee golf course.\n \nFor McCoy Park, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department will develop a new master plan for the site including a detailed diverse and inclusive park design layout. This design will include therapeutic recreation space that accommodates multiple inclusive outdoor sports opportunities including athletic fields, pickleball courts, and a splash pad. It will also provide improvements to parking, family park amenities, and access points at the park. A modification for this contract was planned and is needed to complete the detailed design phase and furnish complete construction documents.\n     \nPrincipal Parties: \nKimley-Horn and Associates, Inc.\n7965 North High Street, Suite 200\nColumbus, Ohio 43235                                                      \nChris Hice, (380) 215-0732                                                   \nContract Compliance Number: 024725\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: February 1, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as this project is currently in design development and this will allow progress to continue without disruption, allowing the Department to take full advantage of the upcoming 2025 construction season to reduce impacts on overall project costs and allowing the Department to make the park amenities available to the public as soon as possible.\nBenefits to the Public: The two parks will provide new amenities such as therapeutic recreation space capable of accommodating multiple outdoor sports opportunities, athletic fields, pickleball courts, a splash pad, and family park amenities for two separate communities. The Columbus Recreation and Parks Department is looking to add more inclusive opportunities for therapeutic recreation at McCoy Park, which is much needed.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Southwest and South East Communities have been heavily involved in providing ideas and input for this project. The Recreation and Parks Department also conducted two public meetings regarding the improvements at Gender Road Park and McCoy Park to gather additional input from the communities.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Southwest (59), South East (65)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to update sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $413,402.82 was legislated for the Gender Road Park and McCoy Park Improvements Project by Ordinance 1418-2023.
