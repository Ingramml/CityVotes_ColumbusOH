    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with various non-profit entities for the Village programs. The entities are:\n•                     At Home on High\n•                     Central Community House for Village Central\n•                     Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center for Village in the Ville\n•                     Village Connections\n \nEach of these programs utilizes a member-driven, strengths-based model focused on developing a mutually supportive network for successful and healthy aging-in-community. The programs serve neighbors age 50 and over. As the older adult population grows, there is a need for innovative approaches to service delivery. \n \nIt can be difficult to hire professionals for “small jobs,” such as unclogging a downspout or replacing furnace filters. These may seem like small tasks, but they can have a big impact on an older adult’s quality of life. Village members also have peace of mind when receiving services through neighborhood volunteers. The Village programs provide older adults with substantial savings compared to market rate services. In an average month, members benefit from $1,500 worth of volunteer service. \n \nThe Village Movement approach to aging is successful not only to ensure that older adults are able to age in their homes, but also in community. This movement fosters interdependence between neighbors that supports aging members, in addition to honoring the contributions of younger members. Older adults participating in these programs will experience a more connected way of life, whether they are a recipient of services, a provider, or both. In order to generate a strong sense of community, the programs engage members in creating and coordinating the activities of the Village. Members have the opportunity to coordinate and attend social outings, volunteer for the Village organization or for other Village members, and act as advocates for other older adults. \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into grant agreements with the not-for-profit entities At Home on High, Central Community House, Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center, and Village Connections in support of their various Villages programs; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, as the older adult population grows there is a need for innovative approaches to service delivery; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Villages program utilizes a member-driven, strengths-based model focused on developing a mutually supportive network for successful and healthy aging-in-community; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Villages program fosters interdependence between neighbors that supports aging members, in addition to honoring the contributions of younger members; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is authorized to enter into grant agreements with the not-for-profit entities At Home on High, Central Community House, Clintonville-Beechwold Community Resources Center, and Village Connections in support of their various Villages programs.\n \nSECTION 2. That the appropriation and expenditure of $50,000.00, or so much thereof as may be needed pursuant to the action authorized in SECTION 1, is authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 3. That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 4. That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That this ordinance will take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
