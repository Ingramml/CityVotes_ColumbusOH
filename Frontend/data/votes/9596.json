    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with EN-Tech Corp., via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Large Diameter Sewer Rehabilitation - Alum Creek Trunk South Section/Deshler Tunnel-Alum Creek Interceptor Sewer/Truro Sewers (hereafter referred to as Alum Creek Trunk South (Phase 1)) project, CIP #650725-100004, in an amount up to $30,559,381.60; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00. (for a total expenditure of $30,561,381.60).\n \nThis sewer rehabilitation project is located almost entirely within Three Creeks Metro Park.  A previous condition assessment of the sewer revealed it is in poor structural condition and in need of rehabilitation.  This project will rehabilitate approximately 8,431 lineal feet of 102-inch diameter reinforced concrete pipe via shotcrete methods.  Shotcrete is a method of applying concrete projected at high velocity onto a surface, giving the sewer pipe the hardened properties of conventional cast-in-place concrete.  This method is less expensive than cast-in-place concrete and is expected to extend the life of the sewer pipe a minimum of 50 years.\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 64, Far South.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Contract work is required to be completed in a manner acceptable to the City within 720 days from the date that a Notice to Proceed (NTP) is given by the City.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $30,559,381.60, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                       $ 30,559,381.60\nFuture Anticipated Needs                           $                0.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                           $          2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                               $  30,561,381.60\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nRehabilitation of the sewer will prevent structural failures that would result in overflows to homes and/or receiving streams, as well as extend the useful service life of the sewer for a minimum of 50 years.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the Public Sanitary Sewers for Alum Creek Trunk South (Phase 1) project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 02/02/24 through 03/13/24.  Two bids were received for the project and were opened on 03/13/24.  The following companies submitted bids:\n  \nCompany                                      Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\n1.
