    "description": "Title\n \nTo declare Friday, February 5, 2021 as Wear Red Day in the City of Columbus and to raise awareness regarding cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death among women. \n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women, claiming the lives of one of every three - more than 50 percent of women are unaware that heart disease is the leading cause of death for women - women of color are even less likely to be aware of this; moreover, nearly 60 percent of stroke deaths are attributed to women and about 4 million of the stroke survivors who alive today are women - African American women have the highest prevalence of stroke among all women; and  \n \nWHEREAS, eighty percent of all cardiovascular disease is preventable as the risk factors for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol can be controlled - unfortunately even with this knowledge, cardiovascular disease kills one woman almost every 80 seconds: and \n \nWHEREAS, the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women® movement was designed to motivate women to learn their family history; to encourage women to meet with their healthcare provider to assess their risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke -to commit to making physical activity and healthy eating a priority ¬- to take charge of their heart health by knowing their total cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar and body mass index, - as these steps will improve heart health; and \n \nWHEREAS, the American Heart Association, recognizing the importance of raising awareness through community collaboration has community programs which include relationships with the Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority  blood pressure program, the Ward Family YMCA blood pressure program,  the Links - Go Red for Women/women’s heart-health education, Celebrate One’s - CPR program, the African American Men’s Wellness Walk Initiative - blood pressure program and  Life’s Simple 7 program, the East Linden and Salem Elementary School’s  Teaching Gardens program, and the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority’s - Pink Goes Red, Go Red for Women/women’s heart-health education, and a host of other community partners, now therefore, \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:  \n \nThat this Council does hereby recognize the importance of the ongoing fight against heart disease and stroke, and proclaim Friday, February 5, 2021 to be NATIONAL WEAR RED DAY® in Columbus, Ohio, and urge all citizens to show their support for women and the fight against heart disease by commemorating this day by wearing the color red - By increasing awareness, speaking out about heart disease and empowering women to reduce their risk for cardiovascular disease, we can save thousands of lives each year.  \n \nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: \n \nThat this Council urges Columbus residents to wear red in recognition of family, friends and neighbors who have suffered from heart disease to show support for women and cardiovascular health.",
