    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio (NAICCO), a non-profit corporation, in support of the Investing in Indianness to Ensure Our Future project.\n \nThe Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio (NAICCO) is devoted to preserving and restoring balance in the lives of Native Americans through traditional, cultural, educational, family, community, and wellness driven values and initiatives.\n \nThe Investing in Indianness to Ensure Our Future project will serve to provide access to Native American cultural and traditional programming and resources at NAICCO. This project will be an extension of the previously implemented Honoring Our Past to Ensure Our Future project, which was well received and deemed beneficial by all who partook in the project. Just like that project, this project will distinctly focus on enhancing cultural preservation/restoration and community development. Through participation in this project Native Americans will develop a deeper connection to their Native American identity (individual, family, and community levels), attain cultural knowledge, develop important life skills, and grow more balanced in life-mind, body, and spirit. The targeted constituency for this project will be individuals from the intertribal community at NAICCO. At the end of the project, NAICCO will implement a survey measuring participants’ views of whether or not they were satisfied with the overall project. Through a satisfaction survey NAICCO will track four key participant satisfaction metrics: 1) Overall Satisfaction Measure, 2) Participant Loyalty Measurement, 3) Attribute Satisfaction Measurements, and 4) Intentions to Return Measurements.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Native American Indian Center of Central Ohio (NAICCO) in support of the Investing in Indianness to Ensure Our Future project; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
