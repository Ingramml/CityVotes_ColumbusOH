This is a planned modification for construction administration services and wetland mitigation bank fee scope items. The wetland mitigation bank fee is the fee for filling in wetlands that are not able to be mitigated on site. The roundabout design was unforeseen during the time of the first contract modification because the Department of Public Service provided direction on moving forward with a roundabout design versus a traffic signal after the first modification of the design contract.  The design fees for these improvements were determined using existing rates in the already established contract.\n \nThis contract modification is necessary for the completion of the design of the project and for adequate technical support during the construction phase of the project.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nDLZ Ohio, Inc.\n6121 Huntley Road\nColumbus, Ohio 43229\nBob Kirkley, (614) 888-0040\nContract Compliance Number: 004939\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: October 24, 2024\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the soccer amenities and programs the City can offer to the public.
