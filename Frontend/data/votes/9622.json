    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\nBy Resolution Nos. 0268X-2019 and 0284X-2019, City Council, as the “organizational board of commissioners,” previously established the Marble Cliff Quarry Community Authority (the “Authority”) pursuant to Ohio Revised Code (“ORC”) Chapter 349 to support that redevelopment of approximately 300 acres of real property located at the northeast corner of Dublin Road and Trabue Road adjacent to a new metro park.  Pursuant to Ordinance 3095-2019, the City and the Authority subsequently entered into the Marble Cliff Quarry Utility Cooperative Agreement to authorize the Authority to provide water and sewer service within its new community district. In order for The Columbus and Franklin County Metropolitan Park District (“Metro Parks”) to obtain water and sewer service for the new metro park under the aforementioned utility cooperative agreement, City Council approved Resolution Nos. 0197X-2022 and 0227X-2022 to add Metro Park’s property to the Authority’s new community district. Now, QT Apartments III LLC, an affiliate of Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC who is the developer of the Authority, (the “Affiliated Developer”), desires to also obtain the same water and sewer services for Tax Parcel ID No. 560-239130 through the Authority. On March 14, 2024, the Affiliated Developer submitted to the Clerk of City Council a Consent to Add Property to a New Community District (the “Consent”) to add an additional parcel to the Authority’s new community district. City Council, by Resolution No. 0052X-2024, adopted on March 18, 2024, determined the sufficiency of the Consent and set a public hearing date on the Consent, which was held on April 15, 2024.  This resolution authorizes the expansion of and defines the boundaries of the Authority’s new community district by adding property identified as Tax Parcel ID No. 560-239130. This resolution also certifies that the public hearing was held in compliance with the requirements of ORC Chapter 349 and authorizes and amendment to the existing Marble Cliff Quarry Utility Cooperative Agreement to include the additional property within the scope of that agreement.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo approve the expansion of and define the boundaries of the new community district of the Marble Cliff Quarry Community Authority by inclusion of Tax Parcel ID No. 560-239130 owned by QT Apartments III LLC; to certify compliance of the requirements for the public hearing on the expansion; and to authorize an amendment of the Marble Cliff Quarry Utility Cooperative Agreement.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to Chapter 349 of the Ohio Revised Code, on August 26, 2019, Marble Cliff Canyon, LLC (the “Developer”) filed a petition (the “Petition”) for the establishment of the Marble Cliff Quarry Community Authority (the “Authority”) with the Clerk of City Council;

and\nWHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance No. 3095-2019, the City and the Authority subsequently entered into the Marble Cliff Quarry Utility Cooperative Agreement dated as of May 1, 2020 (the “Utility Cooperative Agreement”) to authorize the Authority to provide water and sewer service within its new community district; and\nWHEREAs, Section 349.03(B) of the Ohio Revised Code authorizes this Council to add property to the Authority’s District, with the consent of the owner of the property, so long as the developer who submitted the Petition does not file a written objection; and\nWHEREAS, this Council, as the organizational board of commissioners, adopted Resolution No. 0197X-2022 on October 17, 2022, and determined that a consent filed by The Columbus and Franklin County Metropolitan Park District to expand the District with its property in order to obtain water and sewer services complied as to form and substance with the requirements of Section 349.03(B) of the Ohio Revised Code and fixed the time and place for a hearing on the expansion of the District;
