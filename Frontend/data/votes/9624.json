    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Due to increasing development pressure along Hayden Run in northwest Columbus during the early 2000’s, City Council adopted the Interim Hayden Run Corridor Plan pursuant to Ordinance 0662-2004. Next, City Council authorized the City to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding dated November 22, 2004 (the “NW MOU”) with MI Homes of Central Ohio, LLC, Dominion Homes, Inc., Huntington Tower Associates, LLC, Lifestyle Communities Ltd., and Franklin County pursuant to Ordinance 1433-2004. Then, City Council adopted the Hayden Run Corridor Economic Development Plan pursuant to Ordinance 1959-2004. Finally, City Council passed Ordinance 0349-2005 (as amended by Ordinance 2592-2014, the “TIF Ordinance”) to establish two tax increment financing (TIF) incentive districts on the south and north sides of Hayden Run Boulevard (with the northern TIF being, the “Hayden Run North TIF”) to provide funding for public infrastructure improvements in accordance with the plans and NW MOU. \n \nA successor of and subsequent developer who acquired property of Huntington Tower Associates, LLC, Hilliard 853, LLC (the “Developer”), is causing the design and construction of a daycare / preschool within approximately ±1.00 acre of real property near the southeast corner of Hayden Run Road and Leppert Road and the Hayden Run North TIF. The City and the Developer have determined, in relation to the NW MOU, to have the Developer cause the design and construction of certain public infrastructure improvements near the property serving the Hayden Run North TIF. This legislation will authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement (the “TIF Agreement”) with the Developer to reimburse it for the soft costs and hard costs of those public infrastructure improvements. This legislation will also appropriate and authorize the expenditure of the service payments from the Hayden Run North TIF for remittance to the Developer pursuant to the terms of the TIF Agreement.\n \nFiscal Impact:  The City is appropriating and authorizing the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes and property tax rollback payments deposited into the Hayden Run North TIF Fund (7426) to reimburse the Developer for constructing public infrastructure improvements, in accordance with the tax increment financing agreement between the City and Hilliard 853, LLC.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo appropriate and authorize the expenditure of service payments in lieu of taxes from the Hayden Run North TIF Fund; and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development, on behalf of the City, to enter into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement with Hilliard 853, LLC to reimburse the developer for soft and hard costs related to certain public infrastructure improvements required for its project located near Hayden Run Road and Leppert Road.\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, due to increasing development pressure along Hayden Run in northwest Columbus during the early 2000’s, City Council passed Ordinances 0662-2004 and 1959-2004 to respectively adopt the Interim Hayden Run Corridor Plan and Hayden Run Corridor Economic Development Plan; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council also authorized the City, pursuant to Ordinance 1433-2004, to enter into a memorandum of understanding dated November 22, 2004 (the “NW MOU”) with MI Homes of Central Ohio, LLC, Dominion Homes, Inc., Huntington Tower Associates, LLC, Lifestyle Communities Ltd., and Franklin County in order to implement those plans;

and\n \nWHEREAS, the TIF Ordinance (i) declared the improvement to certain parcels of real property to be a public purpose and exempt one-hundred percent of the improvements thereon  for a period of thirty years, (ii) required the owner of each parcel to make service payments in lieu of taxes to the County Treasurer who then will respectively distribute to the schools and the City their appropriate shares, (iii) established TIF funds for deposit of those non-school service payments to the City and (iv) specified the public infrastructure improvements made, to be made or in the process of being made that benefit or serve, or that once made will benefit or serve, the two TIF incentive districts; and\n \nWHEREAS, Hilliard 853, LLC (the “Developer”), a subsequent developer to a portion of the property owned by and a successor to Huntington Tower Associates, LLC, plans to cause the construction of a daycare / preschool within approximately ±1.00 acre of real property comprised of Franklin County Auditor Tax Parcel ID Number 010-318695 (the “Site”) near the southeast corner of Hayden Run Road and Leppert Road; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City and the Developer have determined, in relation to the NW MOU, it is in the best interest of the parties for the Developer to cause the design and construction of certain public infrastructure improvements near the Site that will serve the Hayden Run North TIF; and\nWHEREAS, the City desires to authorize the Director of the Department of Development (the “Director”) to enter into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement (the “TIF Agreement”) with the Developer for the reimbursement of eligible costs of those public infrastructure improvements therein;
