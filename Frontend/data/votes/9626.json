    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: Section 757.70 of House Bill 33 enacted by the 135th General Assembly and effective July 4, 2023, provides that the legislative authority of an impacted city may include a determination in an ordinance adopted under division (B) of Section 5709.40 of the Ohio Revised Code that satisfactory provision has been made for the public improvement needs of the parcels identified in the ordinance and may specify other improvements made, to be made, or in the process of being made that do not directly benefit the parcels identified in the ordinance but are in support of urban redevelopment within the meaning of Section 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code. This legislation makes the determination as to such satisfactory provision and allows the City, as an “impacted city” under Section 1728.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, to use tax increment financing in areas of the City other than the original TIF parcels for other public improvements in support of urban redevelopment within the meaning of Section 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code.  \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to adopt this legislation not later than the June 30, 2024 deadline required in Section 757.70 of House Bill 33 enacted by the 135th General Assembly.\n \nFiscal Impact: No funding is required for this legislation.\n \n \nTitle\nTo determine that satisfactory provision has been made for the public improvement needs of the parcels within certain tax increment financing areas previously adopted in an ordinance of the City under division (B) of Section 5709.40 of the Ohio Revised Code; to include additional public improvements made, to be made, or in the process of being made within the City in support of urban redevelopment within the meaning of Section 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code; to amend each of the TIF Ordinances identified in Exhibit A to this Ordinance; and to declare an emergency.\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”) Sections 5709.40(B), 5709.42, and 5709.43 authorized this Council, by ordinance as may be amended (collectively, the “TIF Ordinances,” attached hereto as Exhibit A), to create one or more tax increment financing (TIF) TIF areas (collectively, the “TIF Areas”), declare the improvement to parcels of real property located within each of the TIF Areas to be a public purpose and exempt from taxation (the “TIF Exemption”), require the owner of each parcel to make service payments in lieu of taxes (the “Service Payments”), provide for the distribution of the applicable portion of such Service Payments to the subjected school districts, establish a municipal public improvement tax increment equivalent fund (each, a “TIF Fund”) for the deposit of those non-school Service Payments, and specify the public improvements for which money in each TIF Fund will be expended; and\n \nWHEREAS, Section 757.70 of  House Bill 33, enacted by the 135th General Assembly and effective July 4, 2023, provides that the City, as an “impacted city” as defined in R.C.

Section 5709.41; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City is making a determination that satisfactory provision has been made for the public improvement needs of each of the TIF Areas; and\n \nWHEREAS, the City desires to specify other public improvements made, to be made, or in the process of being made that do not directly benefit the parcels of the TIF Areas but are in support of urban redevelopment within the meaning of R.C.
