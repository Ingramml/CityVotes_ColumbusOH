    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the appropriation of $800,000.00 in the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to be applied towards the costs of the Griggs Boat Launch Improvements Project via an interfund transfer to the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702. \n \nThe City of Columbus (City) Departments of Public Utilities and Recreation and Parks coordinated with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) to invest funding in the Nottingham and Trabue-Murphy Boat Ramps located at Griggs Reservoir along the east side of the Scioto River. The Director of Public Utilities and the Director of Recreation and Parks entered into a Maximum Reimbursement Cooperative Agreement with ODNR for the Nottingham Boat Ramp, located on the Griggs Reservoir, as authorized by Ordinance 1145-2020. ODNR designated a maximum of $800,000.00 in funding towards this improvement in the form of a reimbursement. \n \nOrdinance 2062-2020 authorized the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to enter into contract with The Righter Company, Inc. for the construction of the Griggs Boat Launch Improvements Project. The project has been completed and ODNR has provided the reimbursement totaling $800,000.00. This expenditure correction done via interfund transfer will apply these funds towards the costs of the project as intended. \n \nBenefits to the Public: The improvements being made to the existing boat launch ramps and abutments allows for residents to more easily and safely access the reservoir during the year. The project increased the efficiency of residents accessing and exiting the reservoir with their boats. \n \nCommunity Input Issues: The Recreation and Parks Department and the Department of Public Utilities Division of Water worked together to obtain feedback from the community during the design phase of the project. The community shared their discontent with the degrading boat launch ramps through various methods. The community has also expressed a desire to increase access capacity to Griggs Reservoir as it can often be crowded during peak season.\n \nArea(s) Affected: West Scioto (37) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department’s Master Plan by providing access for different types of watercraft, improving the ease of use and promoting blueways. \n \nFiscal Impact: $800,000.00 is available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747, as a result of the ODNR reimbursement, to meet the financial obligations of this expenditure correction done via interfund transfer.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $800,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747; to authorize an interfund transfer of $800,000.00 from the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 for the costs associated with the Griggs Boat Launch Improvements Project; to authorize the appropriation of $800,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702; and to authorize the amendment of the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget.
