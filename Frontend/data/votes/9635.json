    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Momentum-Excellence, Inc., a non-profit corporation, to provide operating support.\n \nThis year, approximately 1,000 elementary-aged school children took weekly dance classes set to live piano accompaniment in their school gyms during regular school hours. By May, these students came together from various corners of Columbus to deliver a full-scale performance on the Jo Ann Davidson Theatre stage, accompanied by a live band. The hour long production, Treasures Within, celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, tells a story conceived by Momentum about the treasures within the library, within a book, and within a child.\n \nMomentum’s after-school programs reach hundreds of other children and are also ready to expand, providing children with a safe and constructive alternative during hours when they might otherwise face challenges. Advanced Teams, comprised of children who excelled during their year-long, in-school classes, meet after school to learn more advanced dance techniques and prepare for featured roles in performances. These children also attend a two-week summer intensive day camp that culminates in a performance on the Columbus Commons stage. \n \nColumbus City Council wishes to support Momentum Excellence’s efforts to increase accessibility and make this transformative, life-enriching experience available for every 4th grader in Columbus. Expanding this year-long program will necessitate hiring and training numerous instructors and pianists in the unique method of using the arts to help children reach their full potential. Additionally, Momentum has other programs of shorter duration that are growing rapidly for special needs Early Learners at CCS and typical Early Learners through Headstart.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide Momentum-Excellence with the resources necessary to execute summer programming.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Momentum-Excellence, Inc in support of the organization’s youth dance programming; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
