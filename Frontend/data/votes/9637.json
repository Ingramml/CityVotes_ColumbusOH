    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance authorizes and directs the Director of the Department of Human Resources to modify the contract with CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge for cancer advocacy services. Human Resources has determined that it is necessary to increase the appropriations and expenditure authority by $36,000.00 as AFSCME 2191 and CWA have negotiated these services into their respective union contracts in the last bargaining cycle. As the City is currently in the middle of a contract cycle with CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge, it would not be in the City’s best interest to award these particular services through an additional procurement process. Per the current contract, CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge charges a fee of $1.00 per employee per month for their cancer advocacy services. The modification will increase the contract to include an additional $36,000.00 for these services. The most recent modification, legislated via Ord. 0197-2024, authorized appropriations and a one year extension through February 28, 2025 and provided expenditure authority for $54,000.00. \n \nThis modification provides appropriations, and contract and expenditure authority of $36,000.00 to provide cancer advocacy services to all covered employees.\n  \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nThe total obligation under the original contract and all modifications is $226,000.00.  Sufficient funding is available within the Employee Benefits Fund, administrative subfund, for this contract modification of $36,000.00.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Human Resources to modify and increase the existing contract with CancerLink, LLC dba CancerBridge, to provide cancer advocacy services to all eligible employees; to authorize an appropriation of $36,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Employee Benefits Fund; and to authorize the expenditure of an additional $36,000.00 from the Employee Benefits Fund, administrative subfund. ($36,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the City of Columbus to modify and increase the existing contract with CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge for cancer advocacy services; \n \nWHEREAS, funds for this appropriation are currently available in the Employee Benefits Fund; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the additional expenditure of up to $36,000.00; NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Human Resources is hereby authorized to modify and increase the existing contract with CancerLink LLC, dba CancerBridge, to provide cancer advocacy services to all eligible employees.\n \nSECTION 2.

That from the unappropriated monies in the Employee Benefits Fund 5502, and from all monies estimated to come into said fund from any and all sources and unappropriated for any other purpose, the sum of $36,000.00 is appropriated in Fund 5502, Employee Benefits Fund in the Department of Human Resources, in Object Class 03 Services, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.
