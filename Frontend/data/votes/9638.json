    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with See Brilliance in support of the organization’s STEAM programming for Columbus students.\n \nSee Brilliance is a local non-profit organization with a mission to provide youth and families with educational opportunities rooted in Black and Latinx cultures that equip them to discover their innate brilliance. See Brilliance’s STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) programming includes workshops on various topics such as electronics, micro:bit technology, coding, robotics, and engineering challenges. Programs are suitable for both beginners and more advanced learners, and are constantly updated and culturally relevant. The hands-on approach allows students to solve problems and challenges, and explore new subjects. \n \nSee Brilliance’s focus on culturally responsive STEAM education in Columbus results in a comprehensive educational endeavor designed to engage students in STEAM opportunities. Targeted constituencies include students from underserved communities in urban areas, where access to high-quality STEAM education is limited. Through engaging and interactive activities, See Brilliance aims to foster curiosity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills among participants, empowering them to explore and excel in STEAM fields. In addition to workshops, participants will receive STEAM toolkits containing educational materials, resources, and guides to continue their exploration beyond the program.\n \nEmergency legislation is needed in order to provide timely support to See Brilliance for program opportunities taking place this summer.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding to support this expenditure is available within the general fund and the Job Growth subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with See Brilliance in support of their culturally responsive STEAM education programming; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Job Growth subfund; and to declare an emergency.
