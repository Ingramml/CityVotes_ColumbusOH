    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the appropriation and expenditure of up to $200,000.00 of 2024 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, and restrictive convent with Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio to construct two single family homes.  Each address would have its own set of loan documents.\n \nHabitat for Humanity is a global nonprofit housing organization working in local communities across all 50 states in the U.S. and in approximately 70 countries. Habitat’s vision is of a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Habitat works toward the City’s vision by building strength, stability, and self-reliance in partnership with families in need of decent and affordable housing. Habitat homeowners help build their own homes alongside volunteers and pay an affordable mortgage.\n \nHabitat has a well-planned construction schedule that must take into account timing of public and private funding availability, volunteer labor, and subcontractor schedules.  Habitat for Humanity is the only developer building homeownership units with HOME funds for qualified home buyers who earn between 30-60 % AMI and every home on the list is one purchased or optioned from/with the Land Bank. \n \nHabitat offers a zero percent interest mortgage as well as brings up to 58% of the funding to each deal with the use of donor dollars, the mortgage payments of other Habitat homeowners, and in-kind donations for materials.  These two units are part of the eleven in Columbus that Habitat plans to build in the 2024-2025 construction season and funded, in part, with City of Columbus HOME funds:  \n \n1152 Minnesota Avenue (010-076119) (HOME 2024) Habitat will partner with a family from their pool of vetted applicants to build their single-family, two-story, four-bedroom house on this lot.  \n \n1156 Minnesota Avenue (010-076118) (HOME 2024) Habitat will partner with a family from their pool of vetted applicants to build their single-family, two-story, four-bedroom house on this lot.  \n \nThis legislation represents appropriation for a part of the HOME portion of the 2024 Action Plan per ordinance 2993-2023.\n \n \nContract Compliance:  the vendor number is 004859 and expires 3/20/2025.\n \nFiscal Impact: $200,000.00 is available from the 2024 HOME grant (G442302).  The commitment of funds through this legislation is conditioned on compliance with HUD’s environmental review requirements. The funding from HOME Fund (2201) is only authorized if all HOME review and comment requirements have been met prior to any commitment of funds, as approved by the Responsible Entity Agency Official. An Authorization to Utilize Grant Funds will be received by the City from HUD in advance of the execution of documents for this project.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $200,000.00 of the 2024 HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) entitlement grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD; and to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a commitment letter, loan agreement, promissory note, mortgage, and restrictive covenant with Habitat for Humanity-MidOhio to construct two single family homes with each address having its own set of loan documents.
