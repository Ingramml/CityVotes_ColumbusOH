    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis ordinance is submitted to City Council in response to an application to establish an Agricultural District within the City of Columbus. The Agricultural District designation was created by the Ohio General Assembly and is governed by Chapter 929 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). The five-year designation provides certain protections to farmers against utility assessment, nuisance civil actions, and land appropriation. Jerry Wildermuth and The Wildermuth Family Revocable Living Trust has filed an application for 378 acres located at 3801 Brice Rd (530-166394), 3771 Brice Rd (530-1663900), and Parcel IDs 530-166384, 530-166407, 181-000127, 181-000161. All properties are actively farmed. The application was received by the City Clerk’s Office on April 5, 2024. The ORC requires that the City hold a hearing to consider the designation within 30 days of receiving an application. A hearing was held on May 1, 2024 at which there was no opposition to the applications. The ORC further requires that City Council act on the application within 30 days of the hearing.
