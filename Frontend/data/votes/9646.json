    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with numerous not-for-profit, social service agencies for Year 2 of the department’s Elevate! 2.0 program. See Exhibit A for the list of 4 of the 64 not-for-profit social services agencies included in this ordinance, other agencies were listed on prior ordinances 0655-2024 and 0656-2024 which was approved by Columbus City Council on April 8, 2024. The term of each grant shall be for a 12- month period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. The total amount awarded to the agencies within this ordinance is $250,000.00.  \n                     \nColumbus, renowned as America's Opportunity City, remains a beacon of potential and hope for its residents. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the population faces challenges stemming from personal, societal, structural, and economic factors, which impede their full participation in the city's myriad of opportunities. Acknowledging the complexity of these challenges, the City is committed to implementing a comprehensive solution and is responsible for driving transformative changes to establish equitable opportunities for all residents.\n \nThe Elevate! Initiative plays a pivotal role in this transformative change. This initiative allocates funding to support 112 distinct non-profit organizations categorized into two programs, denoted as 1.0 and 2.0, collectively addressing 16 of the 21 aspirations outlined in The Mayor’s Opportunity Rising. Through various means, the Elevate! Initiative promotes and provides opportunities for collaboration, learning, and resource-sharing among member agencies, ensuring that every community member they serve can access the services needed based upon their unique circumstance.\n \nThe Elevate! 2.0 NOFA (Notice of Funding Availability) was made available to local not-for-profit organizations from September 12, 2022, to October 3, 2022. The Department received 142 applications, requesting a total funding of $14,050,000.00, which were reviewed by a 24-member team. Sixty-four programs were selected for funding in 2023, marking the inaugural year of the three-year Elevate! 2.0 program. Four community agencies are listed within this ordinance, the other agencies were approved by Columbus City Council in prior ordinance submissions.  The Grant Agreements for the second year will be distinct from the first year, although the overarching purpose remains consistent. Awards anticipate renewal in FY2025, contingent on funding availability and program performance as per agreements with each agency.\n \nFunding will be advanced to each agency on a predetermined schedule. Advancement of funds is needed because many of the organizations do not have funding available to be reimbursed for program expenses. The first advance will occur after confirmation of the Purchase Order. Before the second advance is made, the agency shall provide reports and documentation indicating how the funds were used to fulfill the scope of services in the grant agreement. Additionally, these programs/grant agreements may include reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of the programs (e.g. Mid-Ohio Foodbank) which the expenditure is hereby deemed to be a valid public purpose in that such purchase will address the immediate needs of program participants.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding for the agreements are within the Emergency Human Services Fund 2024 budget (Fund 2231), up to $100,000.00, and the Administration Division’s 2024 General Fund budget, up to $150,000.00 (Fund 1000). \n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: See attached Exhibit A for a list of social services agencies and the vendor registration and contract compliance data.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to execute grant agreements with numerous not-for-profit, social service agencies in an amount up to $250,000.00 for Year 2 of the department’s Elevate! program; to authorize the provision of services for a 12 month period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024; to authorize the payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverages for participants of programs included in the grant agreements; to authorize the advancement of funds on a pre-determined schedule during the term of the agreement; to authorize the expenditure of up to $150,000.00 from the Hotel Motel Tax Fund and up to $100,000.00 from the General Fund.
