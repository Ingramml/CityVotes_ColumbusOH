    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: Ordinance 3278-2022 authorized the Franklin County Municipal Court Clerk (\"Municipal Court Clerk\") to modify the contract with CourtView Justice Solutions, Inc., d/b/a Equivant (“CourtView Justice Solution, Inc.”)  for the provision of commercial carrier software, maintenance, support and professional services. \n \nOrdinance 2248-2023 authorized the City Auditor to transfer $200,000 and the Columbus City Council authorized the Municpal Court Clerk to enter into a contract for the provision of commercial carrier service and allow the Municipal Court Clerk to enter into the program established by the Ohio Association of Municipal/County Court Clerks. This program allows courts to have exclusive pricing and service to aid in the delivery of court documents unmatched by the state term contract. The cost saving program utilizes the OneRate pricing program from FedEx. Through the implementation process, it was discovered by CourtView Justice Solution, Inc. that the OneRate pricing program needed to be added to the FedEx Portal. Ordinance 1164-2024 authorized the program change to be implemented. \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the existing contract with FedEx to add an additional pricing agreement. FedEx agreed to change the pricing agreement to allow the FedEx Portal to issue out FedEx mailers by the Two-Day Rate while the OneRate programming is being added. This will allow the Clerk’s Office to start offering FedEx service immediately. \n \nContract Compliance:  71-0427007\nExpiration Date: 7/19/2025\nDAX Vendor Number: 009933\n \nFiscal Impact:  No funds are required.\n \nEmergency:  There is an immediate need to modify the current contract with FedEx for commercial carrier service by adding an additional pricing agreement to ensure proper service procedures are met as soon as possible.\n   \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the contract with FedEx for the addition of a pricing agreement; and to declare an emergency. ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Municipal Court Clerk's Office has a need to modify the existing contract with FedEx services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Municipal Court Clerk’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Municipal Court Clerk to modify the current contract with FedEx by adding an additional pricing agreement to ensure legally required, proper service procedures are met as soon as possible; thereby, preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; now, therefore,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Municipal Court Clerk is authorized to modify the existing contract with FedEx to include the additional pricing agreement for the provision of commercial carrier service for the Municipal Court Clerk's Office.\n \nSection 2.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure, which shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approved by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
