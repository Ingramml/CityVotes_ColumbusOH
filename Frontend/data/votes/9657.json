    "description": "Explanation\n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities (DPU) to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Dynotec, Inc. for the Morrison Booster Station Improvements, CIP #690473-100020, in an amount up to $158,792.93 for Division of Water Contract No. 2414.\n \nAn evaluation of the Morrison Booster Station determined the roof was at the end of its service life and needed a full replacement.  It was also determined improvements could be made to the process piping and more energy efficient lighting should be installed to reduce the energy consumption of the facility. A request for proposals was issued for the design work.  Ordinance 1937-2023 approved the awarding of a design contract to Dynotec, Inc. for this project, and approved initial funding to be used for preliminary design of the project.  Preliminary design is nearing completion.  A planned modification to add funding for detailed design is requested with this ordinance.  A final planned contract modification is anticipated to be needed for engineering services during construction.\n \nThe project is located within the City of Columbus in the Far East planning area (58).\n \nTIMELINE:  The duration of the initial contract for Phase 1 - Preliminary Design Services is 7 months and is expected to begin in September, 2023.  Phase 2 - Detailed Design Services (Modification No. 1) is expected to have a duration of approximately 9 months.  Phase 3 - Engineering Services during Construction (Modification No. 2) is expected to have a duration of approximately 12 months.\n \n1.1                     Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $158,792.93\nThe amount of the initial contract and the anticipated future contract modifications is listed below.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract - Phase 1 Preliminary Design                                                               $  132,906.27\nModification No. 1 - Detailed Design                                                                                         $  158,792.93  (current)\nModification No. 2 - Services during Construction                                          $    50,000.00  (estimated)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                                                               $  341,699.20  (estimated) \n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was awarded under the City RFP process and expected to use two planned contract modifications to add funding as needed.  This is the first of the two planned contract funding modifications.  Another procurement process is not required.  \n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe funding being added is an estimate of the amount needed over the upcoming year.  Once tasks are assigned to this contract, the consultant is able to develop a work breakdown structure for each task.  The fee for each task is then negotiated between Dynotec, Inc. and City project managers based upon the existing contract job titles, hourly rates of pay for each title, and allowable expenses.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nBy completing this project, the Morrison Booster Station will be upgraded with new roof to protect pumps and electrical equipment. This booster station is critical to meet demands of the east area of the water distribution system. The project will incorporate measures, such as energy efficient lighting, to reduce the energy demand of this facility.\n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION \nDynotec, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC005053 and expires 2/12/2026.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% for this contract, including any contract modifications.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the terms and conditions that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Dynotec, Inc. anticipates the following subcontractors will perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                               City/State                       ODI Certification Status \nAdvanced Engineering Consultants                                 Columbus                                                                            MBE\nCDM Smith                                                                                                Columbus                                                                                     MAJ\nLawhon & Associates                                                                           Columbus                                                                                     WBE\n \nThe certifications of Dynotec, Inc., and the above subcontractors were in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n 5.
