    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract, in accordance with the sole source provisions of Columbus City Code, with KNS Services, Inc. for the PAWP Facility Misc. Improvements - Camera Upgrades project, CIP #690291-100000, in an amount of up to $169,000.00.  \n \nThis contract will replace cameras at the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP).  Work will include: providing goods and services to remove existing cameras and cabling; installation of new cameras, cabling, and related appurtenances; and commissioning services.  \n \nThe PAWP is located in planning area “64”.\n \n1.1  Contract Amount\nThe contract amount is $169,000.00, which includes a contingency amount of $16,000.00 (approximately 10% of the quoted amount) to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                               $169,000.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                          $ 0.00         \nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $169,000.00\n \n1.2  Timeline\nIt is anticipated the work will begin in September 2024 and be completed by December 31, 2024.  The contract term will be from the date listed for the commencement of the work on the Notice To Proceed to the time the City accepts the work as completed.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe PAWP provides potable water to a large portion of the City’s service areas and the camera system is an important tool for maintaining awareness of the plant environment and treatment process. Existing camera equipment at the PAWP is past its useful life, is experiencing issues, and is no longer reliable, and needs to be replaced.  All work will be conducted within secure areas of the water plant that is not accessible to the public, so no public meetings are anticipated.\n \n3.  SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT\nA quote for this work was obtained from KNS Services, Inc.  KNS is the only Genetec Unified Elite integrator in the Central Ohio area.  Due to the proprietary nature of the security software and the need to maintain compatibility with the Genetec system for equipment already installed, it is in the best interest of the City to enter into a contract with KNS Services, Inc. in accordance with the City’s sole source procurement provisions rather than incurring additional expense to replace the entire system. \n \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for KNS Services, Inc. is CC-005443 and expires 2/22/2025.  \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal due to the proprietary nature of the equipment.  This contract was not implemented with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  The anticipated MBE/WBE spend for this project is 0.0%.  KNS has not proposed the use of any subcontractors for this contract.\n \nThe certification of KNS Services, Inc. is in good standing at the time of this ordinance.\n \n6. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nThis is a service contract.  Pre-qualification status is not required.\n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  Cash and appropriation also need to be transferred between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract with KNS Services, Inc. for the PAWP Facility Misc.
