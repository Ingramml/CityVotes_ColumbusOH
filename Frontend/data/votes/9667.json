    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a $15,705,443.00 Grant Agreement (Agreement) with the Franklin County Educational Service Center of Central Ohio to support the program goals of the Franklin County Digital Action Agenda and take actionable steps to make meaningful progress toward ensuring people have access to affordable broadband. This ordinance repeals and replaces ordinance 3089-2023, which passed on December 4, 2023.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Columbus worked with the Columbus Metropolitan Library, the Columbus Foundation, Jewish Family Services, YWCA as well as SMART Columbus and other non-profit organizations on making broadband accessible and affordable. An AECOM study done in 2020 provided that over 77,000 residents of Franklin County do not have access to affordable high-speed internet. Reliable internet should be as ubiquitous and affordable as water and electricity.\nIn addition to affordable, high-speed internet access, residents should have access to quality devices with screens large enough to do real work, and skills training to do what they want and need to do online. This partnership and the study started a comprehensive examination of affordable broadband and inclusion in our community and produced the Franklin County Digital Equity Action Agenda which identifies the following program goals: \n•                     Support the Franklin County Digital Equity Coalition\n•                     Create a dedicated program office\n•                     Provide devices and digital skills training for 9,600 households\n•                     Create a digital community anchor force and digital coaches\n•                     Provide continued outreach and adoption efforts for the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)\n•                     Explore and seek opportunities to establish partnerships to extend city fiber for fiber connectivity opportunity\n•                     Fund the assessment of ongoing research and affordable broadband, equity and inclusion outcomes to measure and demonstrate value based outcomes for program activities\n•                     Create a program library of shared resources content, curriculum and support that ensures high-quality services to program participants across multiple anchor partners.\n \nThe above-referenced Agreement authorizes the City of Columbus to provide a total of $15,705,443.00 to the Franklin County Educational Service Center of Central Ohio to assist in the efforts stated herein. These funds will be encumbered for three years with passage of this ordinance and released over that same time period.\nThis ordinance also authorizes the transfer of $15,705,443.00 within the general fund, from the Finance Department’s general fund citywide account to the Department of Technology. These funds will then be subsequently appropriated to the Department of Technology. Additionally, the total expenditure of $15,705,443.00, over a three year period, for the above described purpose from the appropriated moneys is authorized.\nFinally, this Ordinance repeals and replaces Ordinance 3089-2023.\nFISCAL IMPACT\n$15,705,443.00 is available and budgeted in the Finance Department’s general fund citywide account to accommodate the requested transfer and appropriation to the Department of Technology.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nFranklin County Educational Service Center of Central Ohio\nVendor no. 021589\nEMERGENCY\nEmergency designation is requested to ensure that the needed funds are released to the Franklin County Educational Service Center of Central Ohio on the earliest possible date so that the noted project can begin.  \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into a Grant Agreement with Franklin County Educational Service Center of Central Ohio; to authorize the transfer of $15,705,443.00 within the general fund, from the Finance Department’s general fund citywide account to the Department of Technology; to authorize the subsequent appropriation of $15,705,443.00 to the Department of Technology; to authorize the expenditure of $15,705,443.00; to repeal and replace Ordinance 3089-2023; and to declare an emergency.
