    "description": "...Explanation\n \nColumbus Public Health has been awarded a grant from the Ohio Department of Health.  This ordinance is needed to accept and appropriate $156,325.00 in grant monies to fund the Moms Quit for Two Grant program for the period of July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025.  \n \nSmoking during pregnancy remains one of the most preventable causes of infant mortality (CDC, 2004). According to 2020 data released by the Ohio Department of Health 17% of all Ohio mothers smoked during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, a rate that is double that of the nation. In Franklin County, 23.4% of WIC recipients reported smoking before or during pregnancy. The purpose of the Moms Quit for Two Program, an evidence-based smoking cessation program, is to increase smoking cessation rates among pregnant and postpartum women, by offering individualized tobacco cessation treatment, monitoring progress, and providing incentives for remaining smoke-free. This program aims to improve birth outcomes, reduce low birth weights and preterm birth rates, and increase overall quit rates as part of a larger strategy to reduce infant mortality.  \nSince 2014, the Baby & Me Tobacco Free Program at CPH has had a direct impact on infant mortality in Franklin County. Baby and Me Tobacco Free has unequivocally become the largest perinatal smoking cessation program in Ohio serving over 1,000 participants and their families since its inception. Participants are paired and case managed with a Registered Nurse. Baby & Me Tobacco Free nurses have Labor and Delivery, Post-partum, Pediatrics, Breast-feeding, lactation, and Women’s Health specialty experience and expertise. This allows patient and family-centered care as well as support from their nurses, during pregnancy and throughout the first year of their baby’s life. \nThis award-winning and evidence-based program was named a “Best Practice” in May of 2018 by the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs and continues to positively impact the community.  In 2022, 89% of the babies delivered in the program were full term and healthy, with 93% of participants remaining smoke-free through the baby’s first year of life. \nThis ordinance is submitted as an emergency in order to meet the deliverables of the grant; avoid forfeiture of the grant; and to avoid disruption of critical smoking cessation programs for current participants. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The program is fully funded by the Ohio Department of Health and does not generate revenue or require a City match ($156,325.00).   \n \n \n...Title\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to accept a grant from the Ohio Department of Health for the Moms Quit for Two grant program in the amount of $156,325.00; to authorize the appropriation of $156,325.00 from the unappropriated balance of the Health Department Grants Fund; and to declare an emergency.  ($156,325.00) \n \n...Body\n \nWHEREAS, grant funds have been available to Columbus Public Health through the Ohio Department of Health for the Moms Quit for Two Grant program; and,\n  \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to accept and appropriate these funds and any additional funds from the Ohio Department of Health for the support of the Moms Quit for Two grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, the City may receive additional funds awarded for the Ohio Department of Health for the support of the Moms Quit for Two grant program; and,\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to allow the City Auditor to transfer appropriations between object classes for the Moms Quit for Two Grant program as needed upon request by the Columbus Public Health department; and,\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to accept these grant funds from the Ohio Department of Health to meet deliverables and to appropriate these funds to Columbus Public Health for the immediate preservation of the public health, property, safety and welfare, and to avoid delay in client services; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized and directed to accept a grant award of $156,325.00 from the Ohio Department of Health for the Moms Quit for Two Grant for the period July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025.\n \nSECTION 2.  That from the unappropriated monies in the Health Department Grants Fund, Fund No. 2251, and from all monies estimated to come into said Fund from any and all sources for the period ending June 30, 2025, the sum of $156,325.00 and any eligible interest earned during the grant period is hereby appropriated upon receipt of an executed grant agreement to the Health Department, Division No. 5001 per the accounting codes attached in this ordinance. \n                 \nSECTION 3.  That the monies appropriated in the foregoing Section 2 shall be paid upon the order of the Health Commissioner, and that no order shall be drawn or money paid except by voucher, the form of which shall be approved by the City Auditor.\n \nSECTION 5.   At the end of the grant period, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 6.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 6.
