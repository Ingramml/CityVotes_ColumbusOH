    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis Ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to modify and increase the professional engineering services agreement with Hill International, Inc., for the Professional Construction Management Services (PCM) - 2018 Project, CIP #690587-100000, in an amount up to $1,134,700.00.\n \nThis Professional Construction Management (PCM) contract provides assistance to the Division of Water with managing its capital improvement program that consists of multiple capital improvement projects.  The PCM team will help ensure completion of projects in accordance with design requirements and City’s needs, while serving as a liaison between the construction contractor, design professional, and City personnel.  The PCM team shall furnish all necessary personnel, equipment, and materials to perform the work, which will generally consist of program support services, design phase services, and construction management services.  Funds will be authorized through annual contract modifications, or more frequent modifications if required by fiscal needs.\n \nWork performed to date includes program support services, design phase services, and construction management services.  Future phases of the contact will continue program support services and construction management services.  \n \nThe Community Planning Area is “99 - Citywide” because the water facilities associated with this contract serve multiple planning areas.\n \nUPDATED TIMELINE  \nThe original contract began in September 18, 2018 and was legislated to provide construction phase services to projects having a construction notice to proceed date within a two year assignment window running from September 18, 2018 to September 18, 2020.  Several projects that were expected to fall within the two year assignment window for this contract were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. To maintain these projects under this PCM contract as planned, the assignment window was extended to May 31, 2021, by Ordinance 1423-2020, passed by City Council on 7/20/20.\n                     \nThe PCM contract will provide construction services through completion of all assigned construction projects.  The estimated contract end date will be tied to completion of services for the O’Shaughnessy Hydroelectric project, the last project to be assigned to this contract during the assignment window,\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT\n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended:    $  1,134,700.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                                                             $  2,644,800.00\nRenewal #1:                                           $  5,082,200.00\nModification #2:                                           $  5,603,300.00\nModification #3 (contract extension):                                           $              0.00 \nRenewal #4:                                           $  5,429,700.00\nModification #5:                                           $  3,931,400.00\nModification #6:                                                                                  $  3,693,100.00                     \nModification #7 (current):                                                                   $  1,134,700.00\nModification #8 (future):                                                                      $     300,000.00\nContract Total:                                                                                                                                 $27,819,200.00\n \n1.2.  Reason other procurement processes are not used:  This contract was awarded via the City’s RFP process with anticipated modifications to add funding until the last project assigned to the contract under the assignment window is completed.  This ordinance is adding funding to continue the last assigned project.  Another procurement process is not needed to do this.\n \n1.3.  How the cost of modification was determined:  The City identified the services that would be needed for each project over the modification period.  The consultant developed a proposal for the hours/resources necessary to complete the services based upon existing contract job titles, hourly rates, and allowable expenses.  The final price was determined by negotiation between the City and the consultant.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis PCM contract supports a project to provide a safe and reliable water supply to the central Ohio area.  This is necessary for the economic vitality of the service area.  This project is located within secure areas of the water supply system that are not accessible to the public so no community outreach activities are anticipated.  The consultant team has identified a commitment to the Mayor’s Green Initiative in their business practices and will be involved in applying Department of Public Utilities environmental management system (EMS) to the construction project.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHill International’s contract compliance number is CC000990 and expires 11/30/25.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Hill International is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Per the Utilization Plan submitted with this ordinance, Hill International plans to utilize City-certified MBE/WBE firms to perform 3.6% of the work of this contract modification. \nAs part of their proposal, Hill International, Inc. has proposed the following subconsultants/subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                       City/State                                ODI Certification Status\nPrime AE Group                                                   Columbus, Ohio                                      MAJ\nCTL Engineering                                                  Columbus, Ohio                                      MBE\nCDM Smith                                                          Columbus, Ohio                                      MAJ\nDonahue Ideas                                                                                                    Columbus, Ohio                                                                    WBE\n \nThe certification of Hill International, Inc and the above companies was in good standing at the time the contract was modified.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated for this expenditure within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper projects.  A transfer of funds and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund is necessary to align cash and appropriation with the proper projects.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Hill International, Inc. to add funding for the Professional Construction Management Services - 2018 contract; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize a transfer of cash and appropriation within the Water Bond Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of $1,134,700.00 from the Water Bond Fund to pay for the modification.  ($1,134,700.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Professional Construction Management Services - 2018 Project;
