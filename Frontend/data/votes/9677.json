    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract modification with Hazen and Sawyer for professional engineering services for the Fourth Water Plant project, CIP #690600-100000, in an amount up to $55,617,700.00.  \n \nThe Fourth Water Plant (FWP) project will design and construct a new water plant to meet water supply needs and increase the resiliency and reliability of the water supply system.  The FWP site will be located on City owned property in Delaware County, Concord Township, at the southeast corner of Dublin Road (S.R. 745) and Home Road (C.R. 124). \n \nWork performed to date includes Study Services (Phase 1) and Preliminary Design Services (Phase 2).  The Phase 1 Study Services researched and evaluated options related to the new water plant and developed a basis of design for the recommended improvements.  The project was further developed in Preliminary Design.  The preliminary design process advanced the study phase by determining process components, evaluated technology alternatives and developed the design components contained in the final Preliminary Design Report.  This report includes: permitting efforts, site/civil design, process design, opinion of probable construction cost, and project schedule updates. The Preliminary Design Report, prepared in this phase, serves as the foundation for developing the detailed design documents in the next phase of design.\n \nThis modification provides funding for Detailed Design Services (Phase 3), which will develop detailed design drawings for the main plant project and will also provide funding for engineering services during construction for two of the FWP subprojects, the Site Preparation project and the Electrical Substation project.\n \nIt is the City’s intent to execute future contract modifications for Engineering Services During Construction for the rest of the plant construction needs.  \n \nPlanning area = “99-Citywide”\n \nTIMELINE & FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  Phase 1 - Study Phase services began first quarter 2023 and was completed third quarter 2023.  Phase 2 - Preliminary Design Services (Modification No. 1) began 3rd quarter 2023 and is concluding.  Phase 3 - Detailed Design Services (Modification No. 2) is expected to have a duration of approximately 20 months.  Phase 4 - Engineering Services during Construction (Modification No. 3) is expected to have a duration of approximately 36-48 months.  Phase 5 -Additional Engineering Services during Construction (Modification No. 4) is expected to have a duration of approximately 12 months.  December 2030 is the estimated ending date of the agreement based on the total term.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:\nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract - Study Phase                                                                                $  7,470,000.00 (ORD 3316-2022; PO363156)\nModification No. 1 - Preliminary Design                                                      $ 11,838,000.00 (ORD 1692-2023; PO394443)\nModification No. 2 - Detailed Design                                                                    $ 55,617,700.00 (current)\nModification No. 3 - Services during Construction           $24,000,000.00 (estimated)\nModification No. 4 - Services during Construction II                     $ 16,000,000.00 (estimated)\nModification No. 5 - Services during Operation                                 $   8,000,000.00 (estimated)\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                                                                          $122,925,700.00 (estimated)\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT:  \nThe City currently has three water plants that collectively provide drinking water to approximately 1.2 million customers in the City of Columbus and surrounding communities.  The existing water plants include the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP), the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP), and the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP).  The FWP will position the City to meet anticipated water system demands and will improve the reliability and resiliency of the water supply system and help support economic growth of the Central Ohio Area.  Sustainable design options are being evaluated for integration into the project.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nHazen and Sawyer’s contract compliance number is CC000630 and expires 2/27/2026.  Hazen and Sawyer’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract renewal. \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Hazen and Sawyer\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Hazen and Sawyer has proposed the following 18 subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status \nBlack & Veatch                                     Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ\nARCADIS                                             Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ\nAECOM                                                Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ\nStantec Consulting Services Inc.              Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ\nEagon & Associates, Inc.                       Worthington, Ohio                                            MAJ\nKorda/Nemeth Engineering, Inc.             Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ\nRibway Engineering Group                     Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nSmoot Construction Company                 Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nMoody Engineering                                Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nRAMA Consulting                                 Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nResource International                           Columbus, Ohio                                               WBE\nColdwater Consulting                             Columbus, Ohio                                               WBE\nHydrous WD                                         Columbus, Ohio                                               MAJ\nRegency Construction Services              Columbus, Ohio                                               WBE\nAdvanced Engineering Consultants         Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nDynotec                                                Columbus, Ohio                                               MBE\nLanham Engineering                              Powell, Ohio                                                   WBE\n360Water                                              Columbus, Ohio                                              WBE\n \n5.
