The City’s expectation of the CMaR is to keep the construction of the facilities on schedule and on budget.\n \nThis is a large 3-phased project expanding over 3 years.  The 3 phases include:\n \nPhase 1 - Site Development / Pre-Construction Services\nPhase 2 - Building Core and Shell\nPhase 3 - Interior Construction\n \nThis Ordinance will provide funding for Phase 1, pre-construction services, which includes: program validation, construction schedule development, construction cost estimating, constructability reviews, providing the design team with industry best practices, preliminary site logistics and other construction-related items specific to the downtown location such as traffic management.  CK Construction Group, Inc. will work with the design team as they develop three design concepts to present to the City.  Each design concept will have a construction estimate. \n \n2.  FUTURE MODIFICATION(S):  Multiple modifications within each phase may be necessary depending on changes to the scope and/or availability of funds.  A future modification of Phase 1 is expected for construction management services.\n \n3.  BID INFORMATION: The project was let by the Office of Construction Management through Vendor Services and Bonfire on January 11, 2024.

While CK Construction’s score was slightly lower than Elford, their price proposal was $382,158.00 lower than Elford’s. In fact, CK Construction Group, Inc. submitted the lowest price proposal of all respondents. Columbus City Code, Section 329.01(c) defines Best Value as “A selection process in which proposals contain both pricing and performance components, and award is based upon a combination of pricing and performance considerations to determine the offer deemed most advantageous and of the greatest value to the City.” It is the determination of the Department of Finance and Management that the RFSQ proposal submitted by CK Construction Group, Inc. represents the best value for the City of Columbus.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  CK Construction Group, Inc., CC# 006875, expires 8/23/25, Majority-designated\n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against CK Construction Group, Inc \n \nThe ODI goal for this contract is 10%.\n \n5.
