    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes a modification to the agreement with AVI Systems Inc. for the Conference Room 225 project.\n \nOrdinance 3537-2023 authorized the City Clerk to contract with AVI Systems for a technology overhaul in Conference Room 225. That project includes replacing technology equipment that is beyond its useful life, including media devices that have already failed or are beyond maintenance and repair. As part of this renovation project, AVI Systems Inc. is replacing all existing cameras, display monitors, install microphones and corresponding rack components, and implementing a new presentation system.\n \nDuring the course of the project, the need for additional equipment beyond what was included in the original scope became evident. There is a need to add additional funding to the contract to support the acquisition and installation of this additional equipment. This modification will add $5,105.84 to the original agreement, a cost provided by AVI Systems Inc. for the replacement of that specific equipment. The need for additional funding was not known at the time of the original agreement as the equipment had not been identified for replacement or upgrade under the original scope of the agreement, but during the course of work it became evident that replacement was necessary. A modification is the most practical approach given that AVI Systems Inc is already working directly on the associated system components during the rest of the project. \n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to immediately authorize the aforementioned modification to complete the project and bring the room to full functionality.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to modify an agreement with AVI Systems Inc. for the Conference Room 225 project; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($5,105.84)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, ordinance 3537-2023 authorized the City Clerk to contract with AVI Systems for a technology overhaul in Conference Room 225; and\n \nWHEREAS, during the course of the project, the need for additional equipment beyond what was included in the original scope became evident; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Clerk in that it is immediately necessary to authorize a contract modification with AVI System Inc. to complete the project and bring Conference Room 225 to full functionality; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Clerk is hereby authorized to modify an agreement with AVI Systems Inc. for the Conference Room 225 project.\n \nSECTION 2.

That per the action authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance, the expenditure of $5,105.84 is hereby authorized in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, fund 1000, subfund 100018, per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all contracts or contract modifications associated with this legislation.\n \nSECTION 5.  That, for the reasons stated in the Preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
