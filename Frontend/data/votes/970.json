    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: In 2011, city leaders, in coordination with the Forestry Section of the Recreation and Parks Department, committed to an organized project approach to address the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) crisis. To date, more than 30,000 ash trees have been lost and removed city wide. As the EAB project focuses on its last primary objective of reforestation, new related objectives have been created as part of the new Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP). These objectives now include preservation of existing canopy and social equity. As a result, the EAB project is now transitioning into the newly emerging Urban Forestry Master Plan. This ordinance will allow immediate funding for administration, staffing, services, supplies, tree replacements, and to remove hazardous trees. The staffing, supplies, services, and equipment needs that will be paid for as part of this funding request will include, but are not limited to, tree removal contracts, stump removal contracts, tree replacement contracts, cellular service contracts, office supplies, uniforms, computer supplies, forestry supplies, and safety equipment. All supply, service, and equipment needs related to the EAB response have been established as one overall capital improvement approved project. Each direct purchase order, or universal term contract will be written separately based on all City of Columbus Codes that apply.\nThis ordinance is requesting the authorization of $508,985.62 in voted bond funds and the authorization for the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various contracts relating to the Emerald Ash Borer and Urban Forestry Master Plan management process. This ordinance will establish auditor's certificates and authorize expenditures in conjunction with the management of the Emerald Ash Borer infestation and Urban Forestry Master Plan. Contracts will be entered in compliance with the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code Chapter 329, however this legislation will set up all of the funding required to enter into contracts with vendors on an as-needed basis. All purchases will be through competitive bidding, through any current universal term contract, or through any current State of Ohio purchasing contract pre-approved by the City of Columbus Purchasing Office, per Ordinance No. 0582-87.\nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order to continue the Emerald Ash Borer remediation program uninterrupted, continuing to address the EAB crisis as efficiently as possible. It is necessary to authorize this expenditure to have the funding and approval complete when bidding on EAB contracts has been finalized. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Hazardous trees and stumps will be removed, addressing safety concerns in public parks and rights of way. Replacement trees will be planted, adding back to the tree canopy that has been lost to the EAB crisis citywide.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Communities and neighborhoods hit the hardest by the Emerald Ash Borer crisis have expressed their desire for the dangerous trees to be removed and replacement trees planted to restore the tree canopy lost as a result of the infestation.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Citywide (99)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project supports the department’s Master Plan helping to meet the tree canopy goals established by the city and helping to ensure that parks remain safe. \n \nFiscal Impact: $508,985.62 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 to meet the financial obligations of these various expenditures.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to enter into various contracts for management of the Emerald Ash Borer infestation; to authorize the amendment of the 2020 Capital Improvements Budget; to authorize the transfer of $450,000.00 within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; to authorize and direct the City Auditor to establish auditor’s certificates in the amount of $508,985.62 for various expenditures in conjunction with the management of the Emerald Ash Borer infestation; to authorize the expenditure of $508,985.62 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
