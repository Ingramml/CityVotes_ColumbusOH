    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract with Canvaas Consulting, Inc. to run and champion an education and engagement campaign. This Dignity in Transit initiative aims to empower individuals and challenge societal perceptions surrounding public transportation, fostering a culture where public transit is celebrated as a viable and respected mode of transportation for all residents.\n  \nPublic transportation plays a vital role in ensuring accessibility and mobility for diverse communities. However, negative stereotypes and misconceptions about transit ridership persist. This stigma not only undermines the dignity of transit riders but also discourages others from considering public transportation as a viable option. This campaign seeks to address these issues and foster a culture of dignity and respect in transit.  Public transit ridership is diverse, encompassing individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds, ages, and cultural identities. By celebrating the benefits of public transportation, and empowering individuals to make informed choices about their mobility options, this campaign seeks to create a more inclusive and respectful transit environment for all residents.\n \nThrough collaboration with community stakeholders, transit agencies, and advocacy groups, the City aims to promote a positive and empowering narrative around public transit, emphasizing its role as a vital lifeline that connects individuals to opportunities, services, and each other. By elevating the voices and experiences of transit riders and fostering a sense of pride in using public transportation, the City seeks to build a more equitable and dignified transportation system that serves the needs of all members of the community.\n \nCanvaas Consulting, LLC is located within Columbus, Ohio and is well-suited to this work.
