(AMT) in the amount of up to $250,000.00 for the Resurfacing - Urban Paving General Engineering 2024 project.\n \nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus with contractual access to additional design resources that are necessary to perform professional engineering and survey services as well as provide technical expertise for the Department to complete its capital budget commitments. The two individual projects to be analyzed and designed as part of this contract are Design of a Local Public Agency (LPA) project and small to moderate size improvement projects that may be grouped into larger projects.  The contract may be modified as additional funding becomes available.\nThe Department of Public Service, Office of Support Services, solicited Requests for Proposals for the Resurfacing - Urban Paving General Engineering 2024 contract.  The project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bonfire web sites from April 3, 2024, to May 1, 2024.  The City received two (2) responses.  Both proposals were deemed responsive and were fully evaluated when the Evaluation Committee met on May 13, 2024.  The responding firms were:  \nCompany Name                                                     City/State            Majority/MBE/WBE/VET/EBE/LGBTBE/SLBE\nDLZ Ohio, Inc.                                                                                    Columbus, OH                                                                MBE\nAMT                                                                                                         Columbus, OH                                                                MAJ\n \nAMT received the highest score by the evaluation committee and will be awarded the Resurfacing - Urban Paving General Engineering 2024 contract.  \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against AMT. \n \nThe certification of AMT and all associated subcontractors was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \nAs part of their bid AMT has proposed the following 3 subcontractors to work on the project:\n \n\n\n\nCompany Name\n\nCity/State\n\nMajority/ODI Certification\n\n\n\n2LMN, INC. \n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\nMBE\n\n\n\nCompass Infrastructure Group\n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\nWBE\n\n\n\nASC Group INC. \n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\nWBE\n\n\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nAMT’s contract compliance number is CC 045672 and expires 6/9/2025.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align spending with the proper project.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 20% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5.
