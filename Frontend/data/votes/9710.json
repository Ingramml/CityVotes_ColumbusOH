    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton (EMH&T) in the amount of up to $200,000.00 for the Roadway - General Engineering 2020 project.\nThe intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources to perform professional engineering and survey services as well as provide technical expertise for the Department to complete its capital budget commitments.  \n \nOrdinance 0410-2020 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with EMH&T in the amount of up to $250,000.00 for the Roadway - General Engineering 2020 project.  Ordinance 1936-2022 authorized the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $370,000.00.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $200,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $200,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $250,000.00                     (PO215262, Ord. 0410-2020)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $370,000.00                     (PO338071, Ord. 1936-2022)\nThe total of Modification No. 2:                                                                      $200,000.00                     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                            $820,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis modification is necessary to add funding for additional tasks identified that need to be completed to support identified projects.  Design plans, estimates, contract documents, autocad files, reports and supporting information related to the design of the following projects: Roberts Road bridge widening over Clover Groff Run, Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons on Central College Road and Warner Road as part of the Central College Road and Ulry Road projects. As well as formatting the Fee Guidance Memo to follow the same style and layout of the Design Memos being prepared for the City.\n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nThe anticipated schedule for these tasks would be significantly delayed if they were bid out under a new contract. The designer also has established knowledge and experience with the tasks, bidding these tasks out would result in higher costs and longer schedules. It was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract than to bid this part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original contract. \n \nSearches in the System for Award Management (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against EMH&T.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for EMH&T is CC004214 and expires 11/8/2025.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $200,000.00 is available and appropriated within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund within the Department of Public Service.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvements Budget and a transfer of funding is necessary to align funding for these project expenditures. \n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis expenditure is to modify a contract that was put in place prior to the implementation of the Minority and Woman Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise program and as such is not a part of the program.\n \n5.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nTimely preparation and delivery of the plans associated with the noted tasks will be required in order to meet the schedule established for these tasks. Emergency action is requested to complete the project in a timely manner, to preserve the safety of the traveling public.                     \n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of funds within the Streets and Highways Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into a contract modification with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton in connection with the Roadway - General Engineering 2020 project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $200,000.00 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund for the project; and to declare an emergency.  ($200,000.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, contract no.
