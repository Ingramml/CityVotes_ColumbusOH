    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects, P.C. (Gannett) in the amount of up to $562,735.57 for the Bridge Rehabilitation - Front Street and Nationwide Boulevard project.\n \nOrdinance 0824-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Gannett for the Bridge Rehabilitation - Front Street and Nationwide Boulevard project in an amount up to $520,781.96.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, additional resources for design services to rehabilitate the Front Street and Nationwide Boulevard bridges over the railroad tunnel in downtown. The project will include deck replacements, conversion of the bridge abutments to semi-integral, painting of the superstructures, approach slab replacements, and joint replacements.  \n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $562,735.57\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $520,781.96     (PO382727, Ord. 0824-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $562,735.57     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                                            $1,083,517.53  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThe modification was anticipated because the first task on the contract only included the study. The study produced critical information that informed the scope of the design task covered in this modification. \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract to have the company familiar with the project complete the design work rather than to bid the remaining part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract.  The dollar amount for this modification was negotiated between the vendors and the City through multiple rounds of fee proposals, meetings, and negotiations. These fee proposals were evaluated by in-house experience of acceptable bridge engineering design effort quantities and partially by referencing ODOT standard hours for individual bridge design engineering tasks where applicable.\n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nGannett Fleming Engineers & Architects, P.C.’s contract compliance number is CC001829 and expires 12/28/2025.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available and appropriated within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5. EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to expedite this contract to proceed with the rehabilitation, to ensure the safety of the traveling public.\n \nTitle\nTo amend the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Gannett Fleming Engineers & Architects, P.C. for the Bridge Rehabilitation - Front Street and Nationwide Blvd project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $562,735.57 from the Streets and Highways Bond Fund to pay for this contract; and to declare an emergency.
