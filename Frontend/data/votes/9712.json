The site for the new fifty-three acre park was acquired in 2013 for a community park for thousands of residents in one of the city’s fastest growing communities.  The parkland has been on the community’s highest priority list for development. Funds for this project are being provided by the Central College Community Development Authority project account within the Department of Development Hamilton-Central College TIF Fund.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nFacemyer, LLC\nPO Box 304\nSunbury, Ohio 43074\nAda Facemyer, (740) 965-4616\nContract Compliance Number: 005926\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: July 16, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order keep the construction project on schedule in order to open to the public in the fall of 2024.\n \nBenefits to the Public: The Warner Woods Park will be one of the major greenspaces for the entire Rocky Fork-Blacklick Community and far northeast region of the city.

Future subdivision projects currently underway are expected to add an additional 1,000 residents within a 10 minute walk to the park within the next two years.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Since 2014, the surrounding communities have been extensively engaged with the Recreation and Parks Department in the acquisition, anticipated uses, access, surrounding zonings, services, street improvements, and land use planning for this park. The TIF committee charged with prioritizing the City’s TIF and CDA funds for the community’s infrastructure identified the park as one of the highest priorities for development and worked with the City’s Development Department to organize the funding. Civic groups involved include Asherton Grove Condominium Association, Upper Albany West Homeowners' Association, and Albany Crossing Homeowners' Association. Two new large subdivisions are currently under construction surrounding the park space and the future residents will benefit from this new nearby park.   \n \nArea(s) Affected: Rocky Fork-Blacklick (33)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by providing quality recreational parks, trails, and connectivity for Columbus residents.  \n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $9,985,958.00 was legislated by Ordinance 0102-2023 for a construction contract with Ironsite, Inc. DBA Facemyer for the Ulry-Warner Parkland Improvements Project, which is now referred to as Warner Woods Park.
