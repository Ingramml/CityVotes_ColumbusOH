    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with American Structurepoint, Inc. for the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project to increase funding. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $94,421.00. The original contract was authorized by Ordinance 1319-2020. \n \nThe central 0.6 mile segment of the Olentangy Trail, between Northmoor Park and Clinton Como Park, was never completed, forcing users to leave the trail and use a one mile signed on-street route traveling on five different streets. The route is widely recognized as difficult to navigate, congested, narrow, and unsafe. The route includes constricted sections where combined two-way car and trail traffic is on 11 feet to 13 feet wide pavement. This project will complete this final trail gap by designing and constructing a crossing of the Olentangy River at Northmoor Park, traveling along the west bank of the river. At North Broadway, the trail will use an enhanced bike and pedestrian crosswalk and signal to the Ohio Health Campus. The trail will then continue south and cross the river to Clinton Como Park using boardwalks in environmentally sensitive areas where it rejoins the existing trail. Ordinance 1319-2020 authorized the contract for Stage 1 Preliminary Design. Ordinance 1473-2021 authorized the contract for Stage 2 Detailed Design phase of the project. \nThe Olentangy Trail is Central Ohio’s most heavily used greenway trail. Recent trail count data shows over 4 million trail miles per year are traveled on this path. In 2018, Recreation and Parks applied for and received grant funding from the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) to construct the final gap of the 14 mile Olentangy Trail, from Northmoor Park to Clinton Como Park. This modification will complete the final stage of design including construction administration costs that will ensure the compliance with all contractual specifications and documents and the wetland mitigation fees.\nPrincipal Parties: \nAmerican Structurepoint Inc\n2550 Corporate Exchange Drive\nColumbus, Ohio 43231                                        \nTom Hibbard, 614-901-2235 \nContract Compliance Number: 007019\nContract Compliance Expiration Date: June 12, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested as construction for this project is scheduled to begin in June 2024 and this will allow for necessary construction administration services to start immediately, allowing the project to progress without disruption in order to make the amenities available to the public as soon as possible.\n \nBenefits to the Public: Cycling, walking, running, and active trail uses provide highly recognized year round benefits to urban lifestyles. Access to trails and to key destinations is one of the top rated active transportation priorities noted by Columbus residents. It is estimated that over 30,000 residents, 100 businesses, six parks, and 15 schools are within the trailshed of this project.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The Recreation and Parks Department received letters of support from the community, the Clintonville Area Commission, Ohio Health, private developers, and trail users. A public open house was held in early 2021, with over 230 attendees. Over 450 comments have also been received via website, letters, emails, and voicemails.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Olentangy West (38), Clintonville (39)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by improving access to existing trails from surrounding neighborhoods, business districts, and parks. It will also improve trail safety while expanding bicycle infrastructure and accessibility.\n \nFiscal Impact: \n \nThe expenditure of $1,164,026.00 was legislated for professional services in conjunction with the Olentangy Trail - Northmoor to Clinton Como Project by Ordinances 1319-2020 and 1473-2021.
