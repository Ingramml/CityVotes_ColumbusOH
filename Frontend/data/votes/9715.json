Ameresco, Inc. will complete the energy audit under an existing contract for grant application assistance, per Ordinance 2095-2023. \n \nGrant applications are due June 28, 2024. The notification of grant awards is expected in the fall of 2024. The award is expected to be between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00 and will require a 10% match.
