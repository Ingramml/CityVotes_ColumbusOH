    "description": "Explanation\nBackground: \nOrdinance 1960-2023 authorized the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a beneficiary grant agreement with United Way of Central Ohio in the amount not to exceed $126,680.00 to support the implementation of the One Linden Schools Initiative (OLSI) at Hamilton STEM Academy and Windsor STEM Academy.\nOLSI utilizes the Community Collaboration Model (CCM), an evidence-based model developed by leaders at the Community and Youth Collaborative Institute at the College of Social Work at the Ohio State University, to directly engage students, parents, guardians, and educators at the two schools.\nThis legislation authorizes an amendment to Ordinance No. 1960-2023, passed by City Council July 17, 2023, to allow a correction that authorizes the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages for the One Linden Schools Initiative community events and will authorize the Interim Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to modify and extend the existing beneficiary agreement with United Way to June 30, 2025.\nThe legislative language authorizing the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverage was inadvertently omitted from the legislation. Any cost of food and non-alcoholic beverage incurred before the effective date of the original ordinance will not be reimbursed. Food and non-alcoholic beverage related expenditures will be subject to what is allowable in the respective grant agreement and shall not exceed $15 per person.\n \nThe authorization to modify and extend the existing beneficiary agreement with United Way to June 30, 2025 will allow additional time for the OLSI team to continue their work and reach more families in the 2024-2025 school year.\n \nEmergency legislation is necessary to allow for the approval and reimbursement of food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses incurred since the effective date of the contract, and to avoid any program disruption due to the beneficiary grant agreement expiring July 31, 2024.\n \nFiscal Impact: No additional funding is required to modify and extend the contract. This legislation does not have a fiscal impact.\nContract Compliance: The vendor number is 006101 and expires on 03/07/25.\nTitle\nTo amend Ordinance No. 1960-2023 passed by City Council on July 17, 2023, to authorize payment for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses; to authorize the Interim Director of Department of Neighborhoods to modify and extend an existing beneficiary agreement with United Way of Central Ohio, Inc. to June 30, 2025; and declare an emergency. ($0.00) \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Ordinance No. 1960-2023, passed by City Council on July 17, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Neighborhoods to enter into a beneficiary agreement with the United Way of Central Ohio to support the implementation of the One Linden Schools Initiative at Hamilton STEM Academy and Windsor STEM Academy; and\nWHEREAS, One Linden Schools Initiative OLSI utilizes the Community Collaboration Model (CCM), an evidence-based model developed by leaders at the Community and Youth Collaborative Institute at the College of Social Work at the Ohio State University, to directly engage students, parents, guardians, and educators at the two schools; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary amend the ordinance to include food and non-alcoholic beverage as an allowable expense; and\nWHEREAS, the current beneficiary agreement terminates July 31, 2024; and\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to extend the existing beneficiary agreement to June 30, 2025 to allow additional time for the OLSI team to continue their work and reach more families; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Neighborhoods in that it is immediately necessary to amend Ordinance 1960-2023, passed by Columbus City Council on July 17, 2023, in order to reimburse food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses incurred since the date of the agreement, and to prevent OLSI from experiencing undue hardship, for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
