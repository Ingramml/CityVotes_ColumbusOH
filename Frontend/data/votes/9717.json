    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with ARTWAY Inc., a non-profit entity, in support of the ongoing development of arts exchange with Cuba.\nIn 2022, Council sponsored the “Cartes desde Cuba - Letters from Ohio” program. Cartas desde Cuba - Letters from Ohio is a creative collaboration between individuals who share a passion for creating art, cultural dialogues, and supporting communities. From that engagement arose a number of exchange opportunities. Leaders of the Riera Studio, Samuel Riera Mandez and Derbis Campos Hernandez, visited Columbus from June 1 to June 9. During their visit, they conducted a series of lectures and workshops at various locations across the city, including CCAD, Goodwill Studio, Open Door Art Studio, and the Priscilla Tyson Cultural Arts Center. Additionally, an exhibit featuring their works will be showcased at the Lindsay Gallery through June 2024. Furthermore, local Cuban-American pianist Orlay Alanso will perform as part of the project's opening and closing ceremonies in Havana, showcasing a diverse range of artistic expressions.\n \nAs a proud participant in Cuba's Bienal de La Habana, ARTWAY Inc. will be showcasing the vibrancy and diversity of contemporary art from Columbus in this international show. Founded in 1984, this esteemed event held biennially in Havana, Cuba, provides a platform for artists from around the world to express their vision and perspectives. ARTWAY Inc. will prioritize promoting Columbus artists in the global art scene. Through their participation, ARTWAY Inc. aims to bridge cultures, provoke reflection, and foster dialogue on themes such as tradition, challenges, society, memory, and urban life. ARTWAY Inc. will achieve these goals through engaging both visual and performing artists from Columbus by collaborating with Cuban artists.\n \nIn March, ARTWAY Inc. returned to Cuba and met with key figures within the Cuban arts community. During these meetings, ARTWAY Inc. presented a proposal to feature 27 Ohio artists, which was received with enthusiasm. Funding from this grant will support travel expenses, stipends for participating artists, and production costs.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide ARTWAY Inc. with the resources necessary to plan and execute the international engagement without delay.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with ARTWAY Inc. in support of the ongoing development of arts exchange with Cuba; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
