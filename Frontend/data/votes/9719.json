    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe purpose of this ordinances is to allow the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Your Life Has Possibilities in support of the Stop the Summer Slide Summer Camp.\n \nStop the Summer Slide Summer Camp is an academic camp that focuses on the Common Core Reading standards for grades K-5; which helps students to continue their learning over the summer. By implementing this summer camp in 2022, Your Life Has Possibilities was able to prevent their students from losing 39% of what they learned during the academic school year over the summer. The effects of summer learning differences are a primary cause of widening achievement gaps between students of lower and higher socioeconomic levels. The camp will help the students beat the odds, and see cumulative summer learning gains. The students will learn various reading strategies through the following curriculum: Leveled Literacy Intervention, supplemented with Scholastics reading bags for non-fiction, and technology-based reading using Raz Kids. Students attended the following field trips: Columbus Zoo, Slate Run Farm, COSI, Columbus Art Museum, and Innis Woods Parks. Camp participants receive support from the following: Girl Scouts, St. Vincent’s Social Skills training, Columbus Public Health Y.E.S. Program, Taekwondo, art class, and computer class. \n \nThe Stop the Summer Slide Summer Camp has the following goals for all camp participants:\n                     - Students in grades K-3 are exposed to academic learning through instruction in the areas of \n                     reading, math, science, and social studies; literacy is in all content areas of learning.\n                     - Students in grades 1-5 experience extended learning opportunities through field trips.\n                     - Students in grades 1-5 explore math and science through cross-curricular lessons.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: The funding of $80,500.00 is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEMERGENCY ACTION is requested in order to immediately disburse funds in time for the summer months in order to make literacy and learning gains for students in Columbus.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Your Life Has Possibilities in support of the Stop the Summer Slide Summer Camp; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
