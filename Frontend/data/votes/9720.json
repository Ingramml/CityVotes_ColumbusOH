    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus African Festival in support of the 2024 event.\n \nThe Columbus African Festival is a bold, yet comprehensive approach to cultural reconversion and reconstruction within the African Diaspora in Central Ohio. It is grounded in the fact that many festivals which take place in the African communities are either singular or dual-focused (film, performing art, fine art., etc.). The Columbus African Festival as a theoretical and conceptual framework seeks to take a renaissance approach to art and various forms of artistic expression. In this context, art is not just art for art’s sake, but is the creative cultural production of a people’s common history, common lifestyles, and their common and collective aspiration for a higher form of life and humanity.\n \nBuilding on the notion that 2011-2021 is the UN-sanctioned, International Decade for People of African Descent, the Columbus African Festival will showcase the breadth and expansiveness of African and Diasporan creative productive capacity with an emphasis on sustainability. This year’s festival will take place between July 26-28 in Genoa Park.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide the Columbus African Festival with the resources necessary to execute the event in July.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus African Festival in support of the 2024 event; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($50,000.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Columbus African Festival is a bold, yet comprehensive approach to cultural reconversion and reconstruction within the African Diaspora in Central Ohio; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Columbus African Festival seeks to take a renaissance approach to art and various forms of artistic expression; and\n \nWHEREAS, this year’s festival will take place between July 26-28 in Genoa Park; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily business of the City Clerk in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Clerk to enter into a grant agreement to provide the Columbus African Festival with the resources necessary to execute the event in July, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; and NOW, THEREFORE\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
