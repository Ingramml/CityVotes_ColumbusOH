    "description": "Explanation\n \nMayor Ginther’s vision for Columbus, America’s Opportunity City, is that every child is ready for kindergarten. Kindergarten readiness is a multidimensional construct reflecting young children’s preparedness for instruction in areas related to both academic and social-emotional skills. Children who arrive to kindergarten with limited readiness in one or more of these areas face challenges in the transition into the kindergarten setting, and are susceptible to academic achievement over time.\n \nEarly Start Columbus, the City’s kindergarten readiness initiative, has helped prepare thousands of Columbus children for kindergarten over the last ten years.  However, recent work by Future Ready Columbus, Franklin County’s early education-focused public private partnership, has shown that we must act earlier to be successful.  The Office of Education wishes to implement a pilot program with Columbus Early Learning Centers, limited to the use of two (2) classrooms at the City's Hilltop Early Learning Center, to provide childcare and early learning activities for infants and toddlers under four-years of age and to assess the pilot program's impact on kindergarten readiness. \n \nThe City's current Operations Agreement with Columbus Early Learning Centers, authorized by City Council Ordinance 0441-2022, strictly limits the services provided at the City's Hilltop Early Learning Center to pre-kindergarten education for four-year olds. Consequently, a modification to the Operations Agreement is necessary to allow Columbus Early Learning Centers, as part of this pilot program, to provide childcare and early learning activities services to infants and toddlers under four-years of age.  \n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to execute an Appendix to the existing Operations Agreement with Columbus Early Learning Centers, on behalf of the Office of Education, to modify the agreement to allow, in a short term pilot program, provision of childcare and early learning activities to infants and toddlers under four-years of age in (2) classrooms at the Hilltop Early Learning Center and to amend the Conditions of Payment to provide for payment of  up to $1,625.00 per infant or toddler student enrolled. The existing Operations Agreement contract maximum payment of $3,120,000.00 per year will remain unchanged. \n \nNo ($0.00) additional funds will be expended under the modification.  In addition, as noted above, the need for this additional service was not foreseen at the time of the original contract as recent work by Future Ready demonstrated that work with children younger than four is needed.  It is not in the City's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes as CELC already serves as the building's master operator.  The price for serving children younger than four was determined by examining the market rate for such services. \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency legislation is required so that the pilot program can begin at the earliest possible date.  \n \nFiscal Impact: There is no new funding required for this pilot program. ($0.00).\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize an Appendix to the existing Operations Agreement with Columbus Early Learning Centers to allow for use of two (2) classrooms at the City's Hilltop Early Learning Center for provision of childcare and early learning activities for infants and toddlers under four-years of age under a pilot program; and to declare an emergency.
