    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services during construction with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) East Aeration Control Building (EAC) HVAC & Air Purification project, CIP #650372-100000, in an amount up to $542,574.00.\n \nThe HVAC & Air Purification Units in the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant East Aeration Building are nearing the end of their operational life, leading to inefficiencies and maintenance challenges. The original contract provided preliminary design to address the challenges of the aging systems. Renewal No. 1 for Step 2 services, expanded the project's scope to include Detailed Design to include generating detailed plans and specifications, bid documents, construction contract documents, and other design phase services, alongside a crucial expansion to include a full roof replacement due to the deteriorated state of the existing roof. This modification, Modification 1 for Step 3 Services, will involve Engineering Services during Construction, providing critical oversight for the installation of new systems and the roof, ensuring precision and adherence to stringent construction standards and schedules. \n \nThis project is coded as “99 - Citywide”.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $542,574.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                                  $121,506.83 (ORD 0933-2020 PO230129)\nRenewal #1 Amount:                                              $310,065.00 (ORD 1615-2021 PO285961)\nModification #1 (current):                                            $542,574.00 (Current)\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):                                              $974,845.83\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis contract was bid using the City’s Request for Proposal process.  This is a planned modification to add funds to complete the project, so an additional procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the modification using existing contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.  The City project team then negotiated the final cost.  \n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT  \nThis project is necessary for replacement of failing HVAC and Air Purification systems at our facility.  Environmental benefits will likely be inherent in the project, because newly designed units will likely be more energy efficient.  No community outreach or input is believed to be necessary. \n \n3. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nAdvanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd.’s contract compliance number is CC005665 and expires 4/12/26.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. is classified as an MBE by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of subconsultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 93.1%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. has proposed the following subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nBrown and Caldwell                                                              Columbus, Ohio                                                                    MAJ\nDynotec, Inc.                                                                          Columbus, Ohio                                                                                      MBE\n \nThe certification of Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n5. FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract modification will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 3/25/24.  This loan is expected to be approved in July of 2024.\n \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd., and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.\n   \nA transfer of funds from the Sanitary Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, to the Sanitary Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6124, in the amount of $542,574.00, is needed to fund this contract modification.  These transactions are a temporary measure that are required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Reserve Fund.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer. An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.\n \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance. The HVAC & Air Purification units are vital for continuous operation of the aeration process in the treatment system and need to be replaced as soon as possible to keep the plant running. The construction service contract is already in place but cannot proceed until this contract is implemented to provide oversight for the installation of the new systems. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with Advanced Engineering Consultants, Ltd. for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant East Aeration Control Building HVAC & Air Purification project;
