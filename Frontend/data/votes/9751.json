    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into a contract with vCloud Tech, Inc. for the subscription of Redsky MyE911 and E911 Anywhere services for the Columbus City Schools (CCS) for the amount of $106,360.00.\n \nSince 2017, the City of Columbus Technology Department has worked with Columbus City Schools (CCS) to install and maintain their VOIP (voice-over-internet-protocol) phone system. Federal mandates under the Ray Baum Act and Keri's Law require that schools have an updated E911 system in place within their VOIP infrastructure to ensure that 911 call takers can identify the “soft-phone” locations of callers.  Authorization of this contract will ensure that CCS will remain federally compliant with these mandates.\n \nThis ordinance also requests approval to continue the above-described services via a waiver of relevant sections of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code relating to competitive bidding. A bid waiver is needed as there is not sufficient time to obtain and award bids before the current contract expires.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds in the amount of $106,360.00 are available in the Department of Technology Information Services Operating Fund, Fund 4702, Columbus City Schools Telephone Services Subfund.\n \nEMERGENCY\nEmergency designation is being requested for these services that are necessary to support daily operation activities, to ensure no service interruption, and to establish a purchase order at the earliest possible date.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor #: 012179\nCC/FID #: 46-3104792\nExpires 4/19/2026\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to enter into contract with vCloud Tech, Inc. for the subscription of Redsky MyE911 and E911 Anywhere services; to authorize the waiver of relevant sections of Section 329 of the Columbus City Code relating to competitive bidding; and to authorize the expenditure of $106,360.00 from the Department of Technology Information Services Operating Fund and to declare an emergency.
