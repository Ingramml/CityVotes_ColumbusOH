This information will help inform a data-driven action plan that carefully incorporates community perspectives and is built to be dynamic and sustainable.\nVulnerable communities in the City are experiencing soaring rates of mental health issues, as is true throughout the country.

The FUSE Corps Executive Fellow will help assess these opportunities and develop a strategic plan to expand mental health resources for thousands of currently under served residents.\nThe City of Columbus aims to promote public safety by leveraging real-time safety sensor data collection technologies to respond to and investigate criminal activity. Key is data-driven approaches, public transparency, and affiliated public agency stakeholder engagement in the process of selecting, siting, and utilizing new and existing sources and methods of safety sensor data collection. The FUSE Corps Executive Fellow will help develop protocols for decision-makers to use when considering and deploying safety sensor data collection technologies.\nThe above-described services cannot be provided by existing City employees. The fellows providing services at FUSE Corps have unique skill-sets and will provide said service on a limited and/or short-term duration. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nFUSE Corps will have an active contract compliance number before the contract is executed.\n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is budgeted and available in the general fund for the above-described purpose.
