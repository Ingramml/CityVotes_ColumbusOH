    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify a professional services contract with Hunter Marketing in the amount of up to $425,000.00 for the Roadway - LinkUS Mobility Corridors Initiative - Communications, Outreach & Engagement project.\n \nAdditionally, this ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with and to accept funds from the program partners COTA (Central Ohio Transportation Authority) and Franklin County; and  to, as necessary, authorize the acceptance of additional funding from COTA and Franklin County or the return of any unexpended funding to the same after final accounting has been performed or the Department of Public Service certifies that any remaining funds are no longer needed for the project and can be refunded without the need for additional legislative action.\n \nOrdinance 0799-2023 authorized the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Hunter Marketing for the Roadway - LinkUS Mobility Corridors Initiative - Communications, Outreach & Engagement project.  The intent of this project is to provide the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, and program partners COTA (Central Ohio Transportation Authority) and Franklin County with additional resources to perform various communications, outreach, and engagement-related tasks for the deployment of the LinkUS mobility initiative.  This ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to modify the contract in the amount of $425,000.00.\n \n1.1  Amount of additional funds to be expended: $425,000.00\nThe original contract amount:                                                                             $300,000.00     (PO382778, Ord. 0799-2023)                          \nThe total of Modification No. 1:                                                                      $425,000.00     (This Ordinance)\nThe contract amount including all modifications:                       $725,000.00  \n \n1.2  Reasons additional goods/services could not be foreseen:  \nThis is a planned modification to continue services and provide additional resources to perform various communications, outreach, and engagement-related tasks for the deployment of the LinkUS mobility initiative.  \n \n1.3  Reason other procurement processes are not used:\nIt was deemed to be more cost efficient to modify the existing contract to have the company familiar with the project complete the communication, outreach and engagement rather than to bid the remaining part of the work.\n \n1.4  How cost of modification was determined:\nThe cost of this contract modification is consistent with the direct labor, overhead, and profit rates established within the original proposal/contract. \n \n2.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nThe contract compliance number for Hunter Marketing is CC-035651 and expires 04/13/2025.  \n \n3.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $375,000.00 is available and appropriated for this contract within Fund 7704, the Streets and Highways Bond Fund.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget and a transfer of cash and appropriation is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project.\n \nThe remaining $50,000.00 is available in Fund 7766, the Streets and Highways Non Bond Fund.  A transfer of cash and an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is required to establish sufficient budget authority for the project. Funds will need to be appropriated.\n \n4. MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an approved City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 15% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the “City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program Special Provision” that were part of the bid documents for this contract.\n \n5.
