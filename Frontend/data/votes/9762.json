    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify the existing contract with CK Construction Group for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $24,965,238.00. \n \nKilbourne Run Sports Park, located at 4625 Westerville Road, is a soccer specific facility that stretches over 62 acres with 35 of those acres dedicated to athletic space. The park currently contains 16 fields of various sizes, gravel parking lots, an existing shelter, a two story vacant commercial building, as well as, a building used for concessions and storage. Recreation and Parks is updating Kilbourne Run Sports Park to include prime fields and facilities that will increase access to soccer and other field sports for the Columbus Community. This will position Columbus as a destination for regional tournaments. The Recreation and Parks Department previously entered into contract with DLZ Ohio to complete design services and to aid the Department in project delivery. Design will continue through spring of 2024. The work on site is scheduled to begin in spring 2024 and it is the intent that the improved Kilbourne Run Sports Park will open in the spring of 2025. \n \nThis is a Construction Manager at Risk (CMAR) Contract.  This delivery method will save the project money and time compared to a traditional Design Bid Build delivery. This is the second of three planned modifications for the project's guaranteed maximum price. This modification includes costs for the remainder of the project, including earthwork, utilities, pavement, and structures. It will also include the installation of artificial turf fields, playgrounds, and landscaping.\n \nThis modification was foreseen due to the nature of the CMAR contract. The total contract value with this modification is $30,725,625.00.  This includes the original authorization for $29,475.00 for pre-construction services, a first modification for $5,730,912.00, and this second modification for construction for $24,965,238.00 which includes $400,000.00 of owner contingency.  There will also be a third modification that will incorporate the improvements planned in the Right of Way which include drive entrances, a regional basin, and a round-a-bout on State Route 3 and Westerville Woods Drive at the park's entrance.  \n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCK Construction Group\n6245 Westerville Road\nWesterville, Ohio 43081\nJames Negron, (614) 901-8844\nContract Compliance Number: 006875 \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: August 23, 2025\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to keep the project on schedule in order to meet commitments that have been made to residents in opening the new facilities for programming by the spring of 2025. \n \nBenefits to the Public: This project benefits the public by significantly enhancing the soccer amenities and outdoor sports programs the City can offer to the public. Additionally, these improvements set the City of Columbus up to be a major destination for soccer programs and tournaments for all levels of play.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: Input for this project was primarily gathered through the Columbus Community Sports Park feasibility study conducted by Conventions, Sports, and Leisure International (CSL) and managed by the Recreation and Parks Department in the summer of 2021. Input was also received by internal Recreation and Parks stakeholders and the Mayor’s Office. \n \nArea(s) Affected: Northland (35)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by helping to update sports related parks, expanding amenities to appeal to a more diversified audience, and updating five neighborhood parks per year.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $5,760,387.00 was legislated for the Kilbourne Run Sports Park Improvements Project by Ordinances 1801-2023 and 3061-2023. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $24,965,238.00. $24,965,238.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund 7702 and 7712 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification.
