    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to execute a grant agreement with Riverview International Center, Inc. for Housing Support for New Americans. The amount of the agreement is $40,000.00, to be allocated toward case management and general operating support. The term of the Grant Agreement shall be a 24-month period beginning June 1, 2024, and ending June 1, 2026.\n \nColumbus, celebrated as America's Opportunity City, remains dedicated to fostering equitable opportunities for all its residents. However, recent events have highlighted the urgent need for supportive measures for vulnerable communities. The acquisition of nine apartment buildings on Riverview Drive by Peak Property Group has led to the displacement of 88 families, many of whom are immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Initial notices provided only 30 days for tenants to vacate, which is insufficient given the tight housing market in Columbus. After advocacy by the Riverview International Center, Peak Property Group has agreed to extend the notice period to 60 days, provide multilingual notices, and offer specific relocation options to affected residents. Riverview International has also been displaced by this event, as they were previously strategically embedded in the apartment complex to provide support to this vulnerable population.\n \nOrganizations like Riverview International are central to Columbus' strategy to support its diverse communities, and it is necessary for the City to provide crucial funding to support their mission. This initiative addresses the critical need for case management to support displaced residents and families, as well as general operating support to support the increased costs Riverview has incurred due to this process.\n \nFunds will be advanced according to a predetermined schedule to ensure that organizations without the necessary upfront funding can proceed with their programs. The initial advance will be made upon confirmation of the Purchase Order. Subsequent advances will require the agency to submit detailed reports and documentation demonstrating the utilization of funds to meet the grant agreement's service scope.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $40,000.00 is budgeted in the Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION: Emergency Legislation is requested to allow for the immediate case management assistance to support displaced residents.\n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Riverview International Center Inc. in an amount up to $40,000.00 for case management and operational support; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $40,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the advancement of funds on a predetermined schedule; to allow for the payment of expenses beginning June 1, 2024; and to declare an emergency.
