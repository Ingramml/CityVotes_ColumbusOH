    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND:   This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a service contract with R.H. Brown & Company, LLC in an amount up to $153,600.00 of federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA2) funds and $170,000.00 of General Fund, Neighborhood Initiative Subfund to provide support for those in need of emergency rehousing services and to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of Columbus City Code.  To authorize the contract term to be effective November 1, 2023 through December 31, 2025.  \n \nOriginal Agreement                     $   300,000.00                     Ord. 3047-2023                                          PO421838\nModification No. 1                     $   323,600.00\nTotal                                                               $623,600.00\n \nThe City’s Emergency Re-housing Initiative assists tenants who have been involuntarily displaced and are struggling to find available rental housing and re-housing assistance.  This initiative includes helping tenants identify rental housing that meets their needs based on the affordability of rent, family size, and location.  R.H. Brown Company, LLC will work with and support those in need of emergency rehousing in evaluating choices and making informed decisions for their housing needs.  \n \nDue to the current housing crisis, securing new housing quickly is extremely difficult, especially for our most vulnerable residents who are more likely to be involuntarily displaced. These residents usually need immediate assistance to achieve stability after displacement, including help locating housing. The desired outcome is housing stability achieved for involuntarily displaced tenants. This modification will further the City’s Emergency Rehousing Initiative in helping to achieve housing stability for those that are involuntarily displaced.  The scope modification for this contract is to be retroactive to the start date of the original contract.  The reason for the modification to increase funding is that RH Brown is providing rehousing services to our most vulnerable populations and there has been an increase in the need for rehousing since the original contract was awarded.  The contract term date modification is requested to be able to spend funds beyond the end of the grant period for ERA2 dollars (9/30/2025), and facilitate the provision of rehousing services through the end of 2025.\n \nBid Waiver Request:  Under the authority of Columbus City Code Chapter 329, the Director of the Department of Development is requesting that City Council finds it in their best interest to waive the competitive bidding provision of City Code as an emergency exists and is an immediate need for services to assist those that have been involuntarily displaced to help them in finding housing and re-housing assistance.  \n \nEmergency action is necessary to provide relocation services for individuals due to a large-scale emergency vacate of tenants which has quickly expended resources from the initial contract. Additional resources are needed to be prepared for immediate service provision during other vacate events of tenants in the City of Columbus.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  $153,600.00 is available from and within the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund (Fund 2208) and $170,000.00 is available with the General Fund, Neighborhood Initiatives Subfund.\n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 046895 and expires on 10/04/2025.  \n \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a service contract with R.H. Brown & Company, LLC in an amount up to $323,600.00 and to extend the time to provide support for those in need of emergency rehousing services; to waive the competitive bidding provision of Columbus City Code; to authorize the term of the contract from November 1, 2023 to December 31, 2025; to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of $170,000.00 from the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; to authorize the expenditure of $153,600.00 from the ERA2 fund; and to declare an emergency.
