    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Claypool Electric, Inc., via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant (SWWTP) Southwest Switching Station Switchgear Replacement project, CIP #650260-103013, in an amount up to $3,269,860.00; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction prevailing wage services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $3,271,860.00.\n \nThe switchgear in the Southwest Switching Station of the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant had a catastrophic failure.  Some of the switchgear has been temporarily bypassed to allow for continued operation of the plant.  This contract will replace the 15kV switchgear and associated electrical cables to allow the plant to return to normal operations.  This project will also upgrade the HVAC system to account for the additional heat load from the new switchgear.\n \nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be 64, Far South.  \n \nTIMELINE:  Notice to proceed for construction is anticipated to be on or around August 12, 2024. Contract work is required to be completed and delivered to the installation contractor by August 12, 2026.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $3,269,860, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                        $ 3,269,860.00\nFuture Anticipated Needs                            $              0.00\nPrevailing Wage Services                            $        2,000.00\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                $ 3,271,860.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe switchgear in the Southwest Switching Station had a catastrophic failure. Some of the switchgear has been temporarily bypassed to allow for continued operation of the plant. This project will replace this switchgear to return the plant to normal operations.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the SWWTP Southwest Switching Station Switchgear Replacement project was advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 02/21/24 through 03/27/24.  One bid was received for the project and was opened on 03/27/24.  The following company submitted a bid:\n  \nCompany                                      Bid Amount                        Compliance Number       ODI Status\n1. Claypool Electric, Inc.              $3,269,860.00                          CC004366                          WBE\n \nThe Claypool Electric, Inc. bid was deemed the lowest, best, most responsive and responsible bid in the amount of $3,269,860.00.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nClaypool Electric, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004366 and expires 2/28/26.   \n \nSearches in the Excluded Party List System (Federal) and the Findings for Recovery list (State) produced no findings against Claypool Electric, Inc. \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  Claypool Electric, Inc. is a certified WBE with the City of Columbus. After ODI’s review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the “City’s Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise & Small Local Business Enterprise Program Manual” and in the bid documents for this contract.\nClaypool Electric, Inc. listed the following company as a subcontractor for this project:\n \nCompany Name                                                  City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nGeneral Temperature Control, Incorporated      Canal Winchester, Ohio                                   MAJ\n \nThe certification of Claypool Electric, Inc., and the above company was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.  PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nClaypool Electric, Inc. and all subcontractors have met code requirements with respect to pre-qualification, pursuant to relevant sections of Columbus City Code Chapter 329.  \n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe construction portion of this project is anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2767-2023, passed by Council on 10/30/23.  This loan is expected to be approved at the OWDA June Board meeting.  This ordinance is contingent upon the loan being approved by OWDA.  The Department of Public Utilities will inform the Auditor's Office when this loan has been approved.\nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is necessary to align budget authority with the proper project. \n6.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance. The Southwest Switching Station suffered a catastrophic failure which knocked out power to most of the Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plant.  Due to this failure, one side of the switchgear is no longer usable and the plant has a temporary wiring system in place to allow for normal plant operations. We are requesting emergency legislation for this project due to the critical and temporary nature of the current wiring and the extended lead time on this type of electrical equipment.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Claypool Electric, Inc., for the Southerly Waste Water Treatment Plant Southwest Switching Station Switchgear Replacement project;
