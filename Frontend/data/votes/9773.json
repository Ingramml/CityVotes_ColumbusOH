    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction services contract with Travco Construction, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Travco) via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Lead Service Line Replacement - Pilot Program project, CIP #690236-100178, in an amount up to $2,500,000.00; and to authorize the payment of up to $2,000.00 to the Department of Public Service to perform prevailing wage services on this project; for a total expenditure of up to $2,502,000.00.   \n \nUnder the authority provided in the Ohio Constitution, the Ohio Revised Code, and the City of Columbus Charter, the City provides drinking water through its service lines and can permit and install water connections.  The City’s public water system is subject to regulation by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates lead service lines in public water systems through the Lead and Copper Rule at 40 CFR 141 Subpart I, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency regulates lead service lines in the public water systems through Ohio Administrative Code §§3745-81-80 through 3745-81-90. \n \nThe water distribution system is comprised of service lines owned by the City on the public side, and by individual property owners on the private side.  The public side includes the part of the service line installed within the public right-of-way, and the private side includes the part of the service line running from the end of the public right-of-way to the structure on the property.  40 CFR 141 Subpart A defines a lead service line that is owned by the water system, owned by the property owner, or owned by both to include a galvanized service line if the galvanized service line ever was or is currently downstream of any lead service line or a service line of unknown material.  The City excluded lead as an approved material for service lines in 1963.  However, lead service lines currently exist in both the public and private side of the City service lines due to installation prior to the exclusion.  The public health and safety is endangered by the ingestion of drinking water that contains lead.   The use of a lead service line to deliver drinking water from a water main to a residence, business, school, or other building or structure, increases the risk of lead content in the water.  The continued use of lead service lines for an indefinite period of time, without a systematic plan for replacing those lead lines, is a threat to the health and safety of the utility customers as well as the residents, occupants, and visitors to the City.  \n \nIt is anticipated the City, through the Department of Public Utilities Division of Water, will expend in excess of $1.3 billion over the next 10 or so years to replace lead lines to become compliant with anticipated federal and state lead line requirements.   Repair or replacement of only part of a lead service line, leaving some but not all of the lead service line in service, poses a higher risk of releasing lead into the drinking water on the property being served than when the whole existing lead service line is left undisturbed, and this risk should be reduced to the extent practically possible.  It is necessary and appropriate and in the best interest of the City, its inhabitants, and the operations of the City’s drinking water utility to replace all lead service lines in the City’s service area, whether publicly or privately owned, to protect public health, and to avoid noncompliance with federal or state law. \n \nThe City’s Division of Water (DOW) is very experienced in replacing and repairing water service lines located within the public right-of-way.  DOW does not currently perform work outside of the public right-of-way.  To become compliant with anticipated federal and state law concerning lead service lines, DOW will need to develop a lead service line replacement program, along with associated rules and regulations, and become involved in replacing service lines on private property.  There are differences in performing work on service lines on private property versus doing similar work in the public right-of-way.  Rather than learn about these differences after developing a program, rules, and regulations, and learning what should have been incorporated in the program in the midst of a $1.3 billion replacement project, DOW obtained City Council approval via Ordinance 1061-2024, passed by City Council on 4/29/24, to do a limited pilot program with private property volunteers to be able to incorporate lessons learned into the program manual, rules, and regulations before beginning the main replacement program.\n \nThe limited pilot program will be performed in partnership with the City’s Department of Development (DOD).  DOD is in the process of identifying private property owners that want to have their lead lines replaced and are willing to have the City do the work.  DOD obtained a grant through the Ohio Department of Development Lead Safe Ohio program to pay for the work for the private service line replacement.  City Council approved DOD to accept and execute documents related to this grant via Ordinance 3209-2023, passed on 12/4/23.  The contract award to Travco replaces lead and/or galvanized water taps and service lines on the property of the volunteers DOD finds.  This pilot program construction contract is anticipated to cost $2.5 million, with the DOD grant providing up to $1 million for the private service line replacement and DOW providing up to $1.5 million for the public line replacement.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 Citywide.\n \nTIMELINE:  All work shall be complete within 730 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed in July 2024.  The grant funding obtained for this project must be encumbered prior to 7/1/24 or it can be reduced or eliminated.  All grant funded work must be completed by 2/28/26. \n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount of $4,038,549.79 was adjusted down to the budgeted amount for this contract of $2,500,000.00 per a special provision in the bid documents allowing this adjustment to be made. The proposed award amount is the budgeted amount of $2,500,000.00, including a 10% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \n                     Original Contract                     $2,500,000.00                                          \n                     Future Anticipated Needs                     $            0.00\n                       CONTRACT TOTAL                                       $2,500,000.00\n                     Prevailing wage services                                        $       2,000.00\n                                          $2,502,000.00\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will utilize grant money to partially pay for the replacement of known existing lead or galvanized water service lines in the distribution system in order to meet OEPA requirements.  The work will be in conjunction with a Department of Development project to develop/renovate private properties. Community outreach may result through the Neighborhood Liaison Program. \n \n3.  BID INFORMATION\nThis project was formally advertised on the Vendor Services and Bid Express websites from 3/14/24 through 4/17/24.  Three bids were received:\n \nName                                                    Bid Amount________City/State              Status                      \nTravco Construction, Inc.                     $4,038,549.79              Grove City, OH            MAJ\nBoss Excavating & Grading, Inc.          $4,399.910.64               Columbus, OH            MAJ\nMurphy Pipeline Contractors, LLC        $8,318,781.90              Jacksonville, FL           MAJ\n \nThe Travco bid was evaluated and deemed the lowest, best, most responsive bid.  The bid documents contained a special provision stating the contract would not be awarded for more than the amount budgeted.  The contract amount will be set at $2,500,000.00 to match the budgeted amount.\n \nTravco’s certification was in good standing at the time of the contract award.\n \n4.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nTravco’s contract compliance number is CC009944 and expires 9/26/24.\n \nSearches in SAM.gov (Federal) and the Ohio State Auditor’s Office did not find any unresolved findings for recovery against Travco.   \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was bid with an anticipated City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% as assigned by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI).  After review of the Utilization Plan and other related information the contractor submitted with their bid response, ODI has approved an MBE/WBE Program goal of 10% for this contract.  Failure by the contractor to meet this goal subjects the contractor to the Penalties for Non-Compliance as described in the bid documents for this contract.\n \nAs part of their bid, Travco proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                                                             City/State                              ODI Certification Status \nDecker Construction Company                                                        Columbus, OH                                        MAJ\nBiz Tech DBA Tatum Landscaping & Lawncare LLC                     Columbus, OH                                        MBE\nCLB Trucking, Inc.                                                                         Columbus, OH                                        MBE\n \nThe certification of Travco and the above companies was in good standing at the time the bid was awarded.\n \n6.
