    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: This ordinance amends the current authorized strength, as set forth in ordinance 0716-2024.\n \nThe strength levels for most general fund agencies are set to be equal to the 2024 budget as amended by City Council (including the Departments of Health and Recreation and Parks).  Authorized strength levels of smaller non-general fund agencies are set to be equal to the adopted 2024 budget as amended, while the strength levels of certain larger non-general fund agencies may have their strength set slightly higher to allow for flexibility in hiring.\n \nWithin the Municipal Court Judges an increase of six full-time positions is requested in the general fund for a new violence intervention program. The Civil Service Commission requests an increase of two full-time Personnel Analyst positions to assist with classification and testing. Within the Department of Public Safety, Administration Division, authorized strength will decrease by five full-time positions that transferred to the Office of Violence Prevention. The Division of Fire requests six full-time positions moving from grant funding to the general fund to properly align them with budget authority.  Recreation and Parks will increase by two full-time customer service staff, funded by decreasing four part-time positions, and increase by six part-time positions for the Jobs Program.  Public Utilities Administration also requests an additional four full-time positions; three off shift security personnel at Sewer Maintenance Operations Center and one call center staff.  Public Utilities Water division requests an increase of one full-time position at Hap Cremean Water Plant with a corresponding decrease of one part-time position.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funds for these strength levels are budgeted and/or the positions will not be filled until revenues have been clearly identified and appropriated.  In all cases, the ability to hire will be monitored by the Division of Finance and Management.  As such, there is no fiscal impact associated with passage of this ordinance.\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested to allow for the filling of budgeted vacant positions in certain departments in order to assure the immediate preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare.\n \nTitle\n \nTo establish a new authorized strength ordinance for various divisions in the City of Columbus; to repeal ordinance 0716-2024; and to declare an emergency. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Mayor's Executive 2024 budget was submitted to City Council on November 9, 2023 for consideration; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council to adopted said budget on March 4, 2024; and,\n \nWHEREAS, this ordinance repeals authorized strength ordinance 0716-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City of Columbus in that it is immediately necessary to establish a new authorized strength ordinance to provide for the efficient operation of the city, and for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE:\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That pursuant to Section 14 of the City Charter, the maximum number of officers and employees authorized to be employed within the various Departments, Boards and Offices of the City is hereby fixed and established as follows: \n \n-1- Refer to attachment ORD1591-2024currentstrength.xlsx\n-2- Refer to attachment ORD1591-2024previousstrength.xlsx\n \nThe foregoing positions authorized include all positions within each department, division, board, office or commission, whether appointed or elected except the members of any board or commission authorized by charter or ordinance.
