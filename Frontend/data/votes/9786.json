    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Technology (DoT) to renew a contract with Brown Enterprises LLC for Smartsheet Control Center subscriptions and licenses for various city departments. \nSmartsheet is used by several city agencies as it is (and can be) used to collaborate on project timelines, documents, calendars, assignments and related tasks. Smartsheet’s relatively simple user interface centers on \"smartsheets,\" similar to other popular spreadsheets. Additionally, Smartsheet can import data from other applications, such as Microsoft Office or Google.\nIn July of 2021, DoT received four (4) responses to RFQ019097. Brown Enterprises LLC submitted the lowest, responsive quote and was awarded the contract. The original contract, authorized by ordinance 1926-2021 and passed on July 19, 2021, contained language allowing for up to three (3) renewals with mutual agreement by all interested parties. This ordinance authorizes the third (and last) of the three (3) allowable renewals for a one-year term, beginning on September 1, 2024, and ending on August 31, 2025. This renewal includes licenses authorized by a 2023 contract modification in the amount of $53,947.22. \nFinally, this ordinance authorizes the expenditure of up to $285,725.00 for the above-described purpose.\nFISCAL IMPACT\nFunds to cover the cost of this service have been identified and are available in the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund, and the Recreation and Parks Operating Fund.\nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nVendor Name: Brown Enterprises LLC \nDAX Vendor #: 010668, \nExpiration Date 2-2-2026\nEMERGENCY\nEmergency action is requested to ensure that the new contract is in place prior to the expiration of the previous contract. If the contract were to lapse, multiple user departments would not have access to Smartsheet, thus negatively affecting their daily activities.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to renew an existing contract with Brown Enterprises LLC for Smartsheet Control Center subscriptions and licenses; to authorize the expenditure of up to $13,455.00 from the Recreation and Parks Operating fund and $272,270.00 from the Department of Technology, Information Services Operating Fund for the above-mentioned purpose; and to declare an emergency. ($285,725.00) \n \n \nBody\nWHEREAS, on July 2, 2021, Brown Enterprises LLC submitted the lowest responsive bid in response to solicitation RFQ019097 for Smartsheet Control Center subscriptions and licenses; and\nWHEREAS, ordinance 1926-2021, passed on July 19, 2021, authorized the original contract; and\nWHEREAS, the original contract allowed for up to three renewals by mutual agreement and authorization by interested parties; and \nWHEREAS, the Department of Technology desires to exercise the third and last of three (3) allowable renewals by entering into contract with Brown Enterprises LLC, beginning on September 1, 2024, and ending on August 31, 2025 for the above-mentioned services; and\nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Technology in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Technology to enter into contract with Brown Enterprises LLC for Smartsheet Control Center subscriptions and licenses to facilitate prompt contract execution and related payment for services as the current contract expires on August 31, 2024, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE;\nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.
