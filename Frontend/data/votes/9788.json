    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the amendment of Ordinance No. 1397-2024, which authorizes the Finance and Management Director to enter into a non-profit service contract with Impact Community Action to implement the Empowered! program and support energy efficient, sustainable neighborhoods in line with the City’s Columbus Climate Action Plan. Empowered! is a clean-energy jobs program geared toward Columbus residents ages 18-24. The program will provide training and on-the-job experience for careers in the clean-energy sector and focus on recruiting participants from communities of color and women in Opportunity Neighborhoods. These services cannot be provided by current city employees.\n \nOrdinance No. 1397-2024 was approved by City Council on June 3, 2024. There are no amendments needed for the programmatic elements of the contract. However, a change of funding sources is needed. Ordinance No. 1397-2024 authorized the transfer of $2,350,000.00 from the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund to the Sustainable Columbus Fund and the eventual expenditure of $2,350,000.00 from the Sustainable Columbus Fund. It has become necessary to reduce the transfer amount from the General Fund Income Tax Set Aside Subfund and to replace these funds with proceeds from the Sustainable Columbus Workforce Development Subfund. The amount of the contract, totaling $2,350,000.00 will not change.\n \nEmergency action is requested so that necessary amendments can be processed quickly so that program implementation can begin immediately.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo amend Ordinance No. 1397-2024, which was approved by Columbus City Council on June 3, 2024, to modify funding sources; and to declare an emergency.
