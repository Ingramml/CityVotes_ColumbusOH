and\n \nWHEREAS, per current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within this right-of-way and highway easement area, the City will not be adversely affected by the transfer of this right-of-way and the release of the highway easement; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Service submitted a request to the City Attorney’s Office, asking that they establish a value for these above mentioned areas; and\n \nWHEREAS, a value of $176,156.00 for the portion was established; and\n \nWHEREAS, this request went before the Land Review Commission on February 15, 2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, after review of the request, the Land Review Commission voted to recommend the above referenced right-of-way be transferred to and the referenced highway easement portion be released to West 70 Two Owner, LLC at the cost of $0.00 due to complete mitigation and utility easements being retained; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.    That the Director of the Department of Public Service be, and hereby is, authorized to execute a quitclaim deed,  subject to the reservation of easement rights for existing utilities, including a storm sewer(s) that crosses the right-of-way, and other incidental instruments prepared by the City Attorney’s Office, necessary to transfer the right-of-way and release the highway easement as described below and depicted in the attached exhibit which is incorporated into this ordinance for reference, to West 70 Two Owner, LLC;
