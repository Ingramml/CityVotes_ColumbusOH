    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Arts Foundation of Olde Towne, Inc., a non-profit entity, in support of the Hot Times Community Arts & Music Festival.\n \nHot Times is a 48 year old Community event that has seen a lot of transition in its decades. Grown from a neighborhood flea market to a beloved, three-day long community event, the festival has called 240 Parsons Avenue home since 1989. \n \nIn the past, funding for the event has come from the OAC, GCAC, and the National Endowment for the Arts Challenge America Grant, the United Way and the Ohio Arts & Humanities Council. In those years the event could give small honorarium for the artists. In recent years much of that funding has dried up and the Festival has not been able to honor performers with any monetary funding. Still they came and they played for the Community because they see the importance of the bridge this event builds within the City. There is no other festival like Hot Times. This event bridges cultures, incomes, and lifestyles and creates a celebration place for all people, lifestyles and cultures. The event collaborates with Central Community House to produce the Columbus Children's Parade and with other small community partners.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Arts Foundation of Olde Towne, Inc., a non-profit entity, in support of the Hot Times Community Arts & Music Festival; and to authorize an expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.
