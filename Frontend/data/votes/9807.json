    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract for professional services, with Sky Nile Consulting, LLC, to increase the funding in an amount of up to $200,000.00 for the purpose of providing marketing, outreach, education, and engagement services supportive of the Housing for All (HFA) legislative package.   \nIn March 2021, Columbus City Council passed the Housing for All legislative package, which amended Chapters 4501 and 4551 of Columbus City Code. The amendments are intended to address some of the critical affordable housing challenges within the City of Columbus by providing residents fair access and protections in the search for affordable housing. The three ordinances include: Source of Income, Renter’s Choice and Rental Receipt Legislation.  Via community engagement events, a portion of the funding will be used for reasonable food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses.  It is estimated that less than $7,000.00 will be used for food costs.\nOn June 12, 2023, Columbus City Council passed Ordinance 1528-2023, which authorized the Director of Development to enter into contract with Sky Nile Consulting, LLC to execute the aforementioned outlined objectives. \nOn February 26, 2024, City Council passed Ordinance Number 0543-2024 to extend the time frame of the existing contract from March 1, 2024 to March 1, 2025.  This contract extension occurred prior to the passage of the 2024 Operating Budget 3011-2023 and 3012-2023 which passed on March 4, 2024.  With the passage of the budget, the Department of Development is seeking to add funding to continue the marketing and education campaign as outlined above.\n \nThe need to modify could not be foreseen at the time this contract was executed and subsequently modified because the objectives had yet to be measured to determine the need to continue the work.  It is not reasonable for the Department of Development to seek out another firm because this work is ongoing and successfully being carried out by Sky Nile Consulting, LLC.  However, it is necessary to allocate additional funding to this contract.\n \n \nOriginal contract                                          $200,000.00                                          Ord. 1528-2023                                          PO398154\nMod 1                                                                                    $                           0.00                     Ord. 0543-2024\nMod 2                                                                                    $200,000.00                                          Ord. 1466-2024\n                                                                                                         $400,000.00\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiative subfund.\n \nVENDOR COMPLIANCE:  The vendor’s vendor number is 042248 and expires on 05/01/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the contract for professional services with Sky Nile Consulting, LLC, in an amount of up to $200,000.00 for the purpose of providing marketing, outreach, education, and engagement services supportive of the Housing for All (HFA) legislative package;
