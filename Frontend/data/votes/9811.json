The Community Shelter Board is providing each household with temporary housing at a hotel or motel, and coordinating the provision of meals, transportation, and access to a relocation specialist and other support services.\n \nThat Columbus City Council acknowledges and defines as operating costs inherent to the mission of this non-profit the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages for populations experiencing homelessness, housing insecurity, and/or food insecurity.  Any or all of the expenditure authorized by this ordinance may be spent toward payment of food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses for such populations.  Expenses incurred prior to the creation of a purchase order may be reimbursed.  However, in no case may food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses incurred prior to the date of the original legislation adoption be reimbursed.  City Council declares that the expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverage expenses authorized by this ordinance to be for a proper public purpose.\n \nThe number of residents being temporarily housed by the Community Shelter Board has grown to 1300 since the initial $600,000.00 was allocated for this project on December 14, 2023.
