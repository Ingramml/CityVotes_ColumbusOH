    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a Not-for-Profit Services Contract with The Ohio State University, through the College of Social Work, (OSU-CoSW) for the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program and to pay for expenses from PO293529 ($27,968.00).\n \nOrdinance 1435-2021, passed by City Council on June 14, 2021, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with OSU-CoSW for the MBSR program in amount up to $27,968.00.  The agreement was executed with an agreement end date of December 31, 2022 (PO293529).  Because of issues related to COVID, the program was not implemented as planned.  \n \nOrdinance 0591-2023, passed by City Council on March 13, 2023, authorized the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a Not-for-Profit Services Contract with OSU-CoSW for the MBSR program to use the existing purchase order balance of funds to pay for the program.  Due to administrative delays and partnership issues, the program implementation was delayed. The OSU-CoSW is requesting a time extension from July 31, 2024, to December 31, 2024, to complete the Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program which is geared towards justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers. \n \nThe MBSR program is geared towards justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers. In light of the tragic death of Ma'Khia Bryant in 2021, there is a need to provide specific, targeted support for criminal justice system-involved and at-risk Black girls. These girls are experiencing more stress due to the coronavirus and its effect on their mothers (parents/caregivers), with 57% noting that their mental health was worse due to the virus and its affects. In partnership with the Columbus City Council (CCC) and Franklin County Juvenile Court (FCJC), FCJC staff will refer interested parent/caregiver-dyads to the OSU program. This intervention will help reduce stress among all participants and promote restoration and healing that will reduce the potential for law-breaking behavior.\n \nThe targeted constituents include court-involved Black girls aged 14-17 who are also disproportionately affected by PTSD, with 70% of girls with histories of sexual or physical abuse as well as their parents/caregivers. The parent/caregiver-child dyads will undergo a stress reduction intervention, i.e., Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR).  MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology, which is linked to delinquency and other risky behaviors. MBSR may help modulate the dysregulated stress response in the body to improve physical and mental health concurrently. \n \nThe project will be led by Dr. Camille R. Quinn, a licensed, independent social worker in Ohio and Assistant Professor at the OSU College of Social Work. Her work draws on over 20 years of prior experience in social and health services as a practitioner and administrator. She is a funded researcher and has substantive expertise to develop and tailor interventions to improve the well-being of Black youth and their families, especially girls and young women in the community and correctional settings, which are all needed to carry out this project. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: There will be no additional cost for the program.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE: the vendor number is 035414 and expires 1/26/2024, the vendor is currently working with Vendor Services to update their compliance.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a Not-for-Profit Services Contract with The Ohio State University, through the College of Social Work, (OSU-CoSW) for the  Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program and to use the existing purchase order balance of funds to pay for the program; to extend the end date of the contract to December 31, 2024.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, in light of the tragic death of Ma'Khia Bryant in 2021, the City and The Ohio State College of Social Work saw an a need to provide specific targeted support for criminal justice system involved and at-risk girls through the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development and OSU-CoSW executed an agreement for the program in 2021 with an end date of December 31, 2023; and\n \nWHEREAS, due to COVID, the program was not implemented during the term of the agreement; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development and OSU-CoSW desire to implement the program in 2023 and to pay for expenses from the purchase order created for the original agreement; and \n \nWHEREAS, due to administrative delays and partnership issues, the program implementation was delayed. The OSU-CoSW is requesting a time extension from July 31, 2024, to December 31, 2024, to complete the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program which is geared towards justice-involved Black girls and their parents and caregivers.\n \nWHEREAS, it has become necessary in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development to authorize the Director to enter into a not-for-profit services contract with The Ohio State University for the MBSR program; and NOW THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Director of the Department of Development is hereby authorized to modify a Not-for-Profit Services Contract with The Ohio State University, through the College of Social Work, OSU-CoSW for the  Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction MBSR program and to use the existing purchase order balance of funds to pay for the program, and to extend the end date of the contract to December 31, 2024\n \nSECTION 2: That this ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.",
