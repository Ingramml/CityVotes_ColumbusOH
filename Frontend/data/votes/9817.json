    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance will authorize the Director of Public Safety to donate four (4) drafting trailers that are no longer useful to the Columbus Division of Fire to three (3) Ohio Fire Departments. Belmont County Fire & Squad is requesting one (1) of the drafting trailers since they do not have the ideal situation in supplying water in fire situations. Not only would the trailer be used in their county, but also with their mutual aid partners that they support. The City of Munroe Falls is also requesting one (1) of the drafting trailers. Currently they do not have any drafting operation capabilities, which is a significant challenge for a portion of their community that does not have fire hydrants. They currently run a pumper shuttle system which is not efficient. Obtaining this drafting trailer would be a tremendous asset not only for their community but their neighboring departments as well. Berne Township Fire Department is requesting two (2) of the drafting trailers. These trailers would be used in Berne Township and the surrounding areas that do not have access to fire hydrants. \n \nPrincipal Party: \nBelmont County Fire & Squad Officers Association\n69604 Sunset Heights\nBridgeport, OH 43912\n \nCity of Munroe Fire Department\n43 Munroe Falls Avenue\nMunroe Falls, OH 44262\n \nBerne Township Fire Department\nPO Box 310\nSugar Grove, OH 43155\n \nFiscal Impact: No Fiscal Impact\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety to donate four (4) drafting trailers to three (3) Ohio Fire Departments, Belmont County Fire & Squad, City of Munroe Fire Department, and Berne Township Fire Department, to assist their fire departments in fighting fires in areas with limited water sources; and to waive the relevant provisions of Columbus City Code relating to the Sale of City-Owned Personal Property.
