    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract with K.N.S. Services, Inc. for the Hap Cremean Water Plant Miscellaneous Improvements (Camera System) project, CIP #690286-100000, in an amount of up to $410,000.00.  \n \nThis contract will replace cameras at the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP).  Work will include: providing goods and services to remove existing cameras and cabling; installation of new cameras, cabling, and related appurtenances; and commissioning services.  \n \nThe planning area “35” Northland \n \n1.1 Contract Amount\nThe contract amount is $410,000.00, which includes a contingency amount of $35,935.20, to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract, if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nQuote Amount                                               $374,064.80\nContingency                                                 $35,935.20\nCONTRACT TOTAL                                               $410,000.00\n \n1.2 Timeline\nIt is anticipated that the NTP will be issued in September 2024 and work will be completed by January 31, 2025.\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThe HCWP provides potable water to a large portion of the City’s service areas and the camera system is an important tool for maintaining awareness of the Plant environment and treatment process. Existing camera equipment at the HCWP is past its useful life, is experiencing issues, and is no longer reliable, and needs to be replaced.  All work will be conducted within secure areas of the water Plant that is not accessible to the public, so no public meetings are anticipated.\n \n3.  SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT\nAll Department of Public Utilities buildings use City-standard Genetic security equipment.  A quote for this work was obtained from K.N.S. Services, Inc.  They are the only Genetec Unified Elite integrator in the Central Ohio area.  Due to the proprietary nature of the security software and the need to maintain compatibility with the Genetec system, it is in the best interest of the City to enter into a contract with K.N.S. Services Inc. in accordance with the City’s sole source procurement provisions. \n \n4. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION\nThe contract compliance number for K.N.S. Services, Inc. is CC005433 and expires 2/22/2025. \n \n5.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding.  ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal due to the proprietary nature of the equipment.  This contract was not implemented with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.  The anticipated MBE/WBE spend for this project is 0.0%. There are no subcontractors on this project\n \nThe certification of K.N.S. Services, Inc. is in good standing at the time of this ordinance.\n \n6. PRE-QUALIFICATION STATUS\nThis is a service contract.  Pre-qualification status is not required.\n \n7.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunds are available and appropriated within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006.  An amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project. Cash and appropriation also need to be transferred between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to enter into a service contract with K.N.S.
