    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a contract with Synagro Central, LLC for the Water Treatment Residuals Turnkey Dewatering Services Project. The project is expected to be completed sometime in 2040.\n \nThis contract shall provide Water Treatment Residuals (WTR) management services for WTR stored in the McKinley Avenue Quarry (MAQ), which includes WTR from the Hap Cremean Water Plant (HCWP), the Dublin Road Water Plant (DRWP), and the Parsons Avenue Water Plant (PAWP). \n \nThe WTR Management Services includes: the operation and maintenance of the dewatering facility at the MAQ; maintenance of the premises licensed to Synagro Central, LLC; supplying rolling stock to complete the WTR management services; operation and maintenance of the rolling stock provided by the Company, dredging, acceptance, dewatering, processing, handling, transportation, marketing and utilization of WTR produced and related obligations to facilitate this service including permitting compliance.\n \nThe Community Planning Area is 99 - Citywide since the facility will handle WTR from all three water plants (DRWP, HCWP and PAWP), which serve multiple several Columbus communities\n \nPROCUREMENT:  \n \nThe Department of Public Utilities solicited competitive bids through the Vendor Services and Bonfire websites from September 3, 2021 for this project in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of City Code (RFQ018958). One (1) bid was received. \n \nThe proposed contract amount is $0.00 for the contract initiation and execution. Subsequent annual contract modifications are anticipated to provide funding.  Cost will be based on a service fee that includes a unit cost per dry ton of water treatment residuals beneficially used per year. The contract incorporates pricing adjustments associated with corresponding economic indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the duration of the term. The pricing adjustments and increase in quantity over the contract duration is the basis of the annually increasing costs. \n \nThe project will extend the life of the MAQ for residuals disposal and improve the sustainability of DOW’s WTR management methods by diverting a significant portion of the WTR to beneficial uses.  Almost all work will be conducted in areas not accessible to the public, so DOW does not anticipate conducting community outreach for this project, but can do so if the need arises\n \nMINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM:\n \nThis contract opportunity was submitted to the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) for review and assignment of an MBE/WBE goal prior to bidding. ODI determined there was not an opportunity for MBE/WBE participation in this contract and did not assign a goal. This contract was not bid with a City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program goal and the requirements of the City’s MBE/WBE Program are not applicable to this contract.\n \nSUPPLIER:  \n \nSynagro Central, LLC | EIN on file | D365 #010213 | Expiration date 5/11/2025\n \nThe company is not debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  \n \n$0.00 is anticipated for the initial contract value.
