BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a planned contract modification for professional engineering services with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Hoover Dam Improvements - Part 2, CIP #690411-100014, in an amount up to $898,500.00 for Division of Water Contract No. 2374.\n \nWork completed to date is preliminary engineering which included a study to evaluate the condition of dam spillway and abutments and ancillary equipment. The study used comparative cost analysis to support recommendations and included conceptual design of required improvements or modifications, including potential alternatives to existing ancillary equipment. The study phase of the project was completed in May 2024.\n \nThis is a planned contract modification to add funding for detailed design.  The primary objective of this contract modification is to develop a concise set of detailed design documents that will allow for the complete construction of facilities recommendations from the preliminary design phase.  These recommendations will increase security, resiliency, flexibility, and ease of operation with reasonable maintenance requirements.  \n \nA future contract modification is anticipated. That contract modification is anticipated to add funds to provide Engineering Services during construction. This modification was identified in the City’s Request for Proposals (RFP).\n \nThe Community Planning Area for the Hoover Dam is “99” Citywide.\n \n1.1 Amount of additional funds to be expended:  $898,500.00\nOriginal Contract Amount:                                                                            $600,000.00                     (Ord. 3116-2022 PO365326)\nModification #1 Amount:                                                                             $898,500.00 (current)\nTotal (Orig. + Renewal/Modification):                                                                                             $1,498,500.00\n \n1.2. Reason other procurement processes are not used:  \nThis is a planned modification to add funding for detailed design as described in Ordinance 3116-2022, approved by City Council on 12/12/22, authorizing this contract.  Another procurement process is not needed.\n \n1.3. How cost of modification was determined:\nThe Consultant prepared an estimate based on the scope of work for the detail design modification using current contract job titles, pay rates, and allowable expenses.  The City Project Manager and associated staff negotiated the final cost.\n \n2. ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT \nThis project will address infrastructure associated with Hoover Dam, which is a critical part of the City of Columbus’s water supply system. Periodic evaluation of and capital investment into the Dam is crucial for public safety and the reliability of the water supply system, which supports economic growth of the Central Ohio area. \n \nNo public meetings are anticipated to be held during the detailed design phase of the project.  \n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFORMATION  \nBurgess & Niple, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC004425 and expires 1/10/26.\n \n4.  MINORITY AND WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE & SMALL LOCAL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM\nThis contract was put in place prior to the implementation of the City of Columbus MBE/WBE Program and is not subject to the requirements of that program.  Burgess & Niple, Inc. is classified as a majority company by the City’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion.  Burgess & Niple, Inc. anticipates performing the work on this contract modification with the use of sub-consultants.  The MBE/WBE percentage for this modification is expected to be 17.6%.\n \nAs part of their proposal, Burgess & Niple, Inc. has proposed the following three subcontractors to perform contract work:\n \nCompany Name                                            City/State                                     ODI Certification Status\nCAD Concepts, Inc.                                                                      Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\nResource International, Inc.                                               Columbus, Ohio                                                                                    WBE\n \nThe certification of Burgess & Niple, Inc. and the above companies was in good standing at the time of this contract modification.\n \n5.  FISCAL IMPACT\nAn amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project.  Cash and appropriation need to be transferred between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project. \n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Utilities to modify and increase the contract with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Hoover Dam Improvements - Part 2 project; to authorize an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the transfer of cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund; and to authorize an expenditure of up to $898,500.00 from the Water Bond Fund to pay for the contract modification.  ($898,500.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the Department of Public Utilities is engaged in the Hoover Dam Improvements - Part 2 project; and\n \nWHEREAS, Contract No. PO325326 was authorized by Ordinance No. 3116-2022, for the Hoover Dam Improvements - Part 2 project; and\n \nWHEREAS, a planned contract modification is needed for professional engineering services to add funds for detailed design of the project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary for Council to authorize the Director of Public Utilities to modify the professional engineering services agreement with Burgess & Niple, Inc. for the Hoover Dam Improvements - Part 2 project; and \n \nWHEREAS, an amendment to the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget is needed to align budget authority with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to align cash and appropriation with the proper project; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to expend funds from the Water Bond Fund, Fund 6006, to pay for the contract modification; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the 2023 Capital Improvement Budget authorized by Ordinance 1711-2023 be amended as follows to establish sufficient budget authority for this project:\n \nFund / Project Number / Project Name / Current Authority / Revised Authority / Change\n6006 / P690473-100013 / Morse West Booster Station Improvements (Voted Water Carryover) / $4,408.00 / 0.00 / ($4,408.00)\n6006 / P690473-100014 / Smoky Row Booster Station Roof Improvements (Voted Water Carryover) / $2,417.00 / $0.00 / ($2,417.00)\n6006 / P690473-100019 / Stelzer Road PRV (Voted Water Carryover) / $55,328.00 / $2,000.00 / ($53,328.00)\n6006 / P690502-100000 / Dublin Road 30” Water Line (Voted Water Carryover) / $69,649.00 / $2,000.00 / ($67,649.00)\n6006 / P690528-100004 / 2023 - 2025 Gen'l Engineering Services - Distribution Group (Voted Water Carryover) / $724,838.00 / $600,000.00 / ($124,838.00)\n6006 / P690559-100002 / HCWP Sludge Removal - Lagoon 1 (2020) (Voted Water Carryover) / $49,996.00 / $0.00 / ($49,996.00)\n6006 / P690006-100003 / Misc.
