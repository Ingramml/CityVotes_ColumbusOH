    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to execute agreements with and to accept deposits and/or reimbursements from the Franklin County Engineer’s Office for work performed as part of the Roadway - Shook Road Phase II project. \nThe aforementioned effort will culminate in the widening of Shook Road north of SR 317 to provide a southbound right turn lane, the widening of SR 317 to provide both westbound and eastbound left turn lanes at the intersection, the construction of a sidewalk along the west and east sides of Shook Road from SR 317 north to existing sidewalk limits, and various other improvements. As part of that effort, the Department of Public Service has agreed to resurface the southbound lane of Shook Road from SR 317 to a point 671 feet south of SR 317 at the behest of the Franklin County Engineer’s Office, which will reimburse the City for the cost of work, presently estimated to be $17,242.74.\nThis ordinance also authorizes, as necessary, the issuance of a refund of any sum received in excess of the proportionate share of eligible construction costs to be borne by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office.  The refund is to be issued after final accounting for the project is complete or upon certification from the Department of Public Service, Division of Design and Construction, that any funds remaining on deposit from the Franklin County Engineer's Office are not needed and can be refunded. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nPursuant to preliminary cost estimates, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office has agreed to reimburse the Department of Public Service for costs incurred relative to resurfacing the southbound lane of Shook Road, with the understanding that the actual amount owed for that purpose may vary based upon the apparent low bid and final quantities. A separate ordinance authorizing the award of a construction contract and the encumbrance and expenditure of City funds to support the construction costs will be put forth for consideration by City Council at a later time.  \n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so as to prevent avoidable delays in the completion of necessary public infrastructure improvements.  \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Service to enter into agreements with, and to accept funds from, the Franklin County Engineer’s Office relative to the Roadway - Shook Road Phase II project; to authorize the Director of Public Service to refund any sum received in excess of the proportionate share of eligible construction costs to be borne by the Franklin County Engineer’s Office; and to declare an emergency.
