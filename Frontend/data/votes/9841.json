    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City of Columbus Department of Public Safety received a $1.6 million Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Use Site-based Program (COSSUP) grant award from the United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. Grant award period: October 1, 2023, through October 1, 2026.\n \nCOSSUP funding supports continued outreach services provided through the City’s Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT). RREACT is an innovative outreach service operated by the Division of Fire to actively address the opioid crisis negatively impacting far too many Columbus residents.\n \nRREACT outreach includes firefighters/paramedics, Crisis Intervention Team certified peace officers, a substance use case manager, a family case manager, and trauma specialist. RREACT proactively connects and builds relationships with opioid users to 1) forge treatment and recovery pathways for users, and 2) provide multi-sector social service navigation and trauma counseling for children and other caregivers in the home. This multi-disciplinary outreach team goes directly into communities to connect with individuals who survive overdose (after Narcan© administration) but then refuse EMS transport to the emergency room. At these follow up meetings, team members assess immediate health needs, provide resource referrals, and create opportunities for users and family/household members to link with harm reduction supplies, treatment programs, trauma services, and social benefit supports.\n \nRREACT program activities include connecting overdose survivors with evidence-based harm reduction services and licensed treatment programs; addressing health care disparities and increase access to overdose prevention, treatment, and recovery resources for minority groups; connecting families with trauma specialists to rapidly respond to the needs of children impacted by drug overdose; implementing drug take-back campaigns in partnership with the DEA and local community organizations; expanding access to peer recovery and case management services for individuals with substance use disorder and justice involvement and their families; developing and implementing harm reduction and drug prevention campaigns for K-12 students within the vulnerable communities. \n \nGrant funds support one family case manager, one trauma specialist, family and children support specialist, and overtime costs for firefighters/paramedics and peace officers to fill in when sworn RREACT staff are on vacation, sick and/or attending mandatory training. Grant funds also support continued program management and grant management, data analysis, project evaluation.\n \nIn order to achieve project deliverables, RREACT requests legislative approval to: \n \n1)                     Enter into a $155,500.00 contract with Franklin County Family and Children First Council to continue family case management and trauma services. Such multi-system family case management and trauma services are only available through Franklin County Family and Children First Council.\n \n2)                     Waive bidding requirements and enter into a $87,293.00 service contract with Village Venture, LLC to continue program management, grant management and data analysis. ~ Bid Waiver Form is included with ordinance attachments. \n \nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay program services and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $1,600,000.00 in Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Site-based Program (COSSUP) funds from the United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. This initiative does not generate any revenue nor require a City match.\n \nFederal Award: October 1, 2023, through October 1, 2026 \n§ 15PBJA-23-GG-02325-COAP - $1,600,000.00 grant award\n \n§ No City match required\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Public Safety to accept a $1,600,000.00 Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant and Substance Use Site-based Program (COSSUP) grant award from United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance; to authorize the appropriation of $1,600,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund 2220; to authorize the expenditure of $1,600,000.00; to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a $155,500.00 contract with Franklin County Family and Children First Council for multi-sector family case management and trauma recovery services; to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a $87,293.00 service contract with Village Venture, LLC to continue program management, grant management and data analysis; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; and to declare an emergency.
