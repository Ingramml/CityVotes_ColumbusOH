    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND: The City of Columbus, Division of Public Safety received 2023 Overdose Data to Action funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via a sub award from Franklin County Public Health (FCPH). This sub award addresses the local opioid crisis by expanding the capacity of the Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT) and increasing linkages to RREACT outreach and education services. This ordinance accepts and appropriates year one project funds totaling $280,941.00. The 2023 CDC OD2A subaward budget period is September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024. The full project period is September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2028. This ordinance authorizes an appropriation of funds upon receipt of annual executed agreements.\n \nRapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team (RREACT) is an innovative outreach effort addressing the opioid crisis ravaging Columbus, Ohio. RREACT team members go out into the community and do face to face follow up visits with substance users revived from opioid overdose by police or fire first responders who have refused immediate transport to clinical facilities thereby bi-passing treatment and recovery resources available through emergency rooms across the city. RREACT connects with survivors in their neighborhoods within 48 hours of overdose. The team includes a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trained peace officer, a paramedic, a social worker and a trauma specialist.  The goal of this multi-disciplinary outreach team is to help stabilize the household in an effort to reduce barriers to accessing drug and/or behavioral treatment for the substance user. \nRREACT will use the CDC OD2A funding for the continued operation of the RREACT EMS/mobile crisis outreach team, dedicated to serving Franklin County neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by opioid-related overdose (zip codes 43204, 43207, 43211, 43223, and 43232) and extending outreach to the under served minority populations. RREACT will also collaborate with OD2A partners, community organizations, and advocacy groups to provide CPR/First Aid training and distribute naloxone and fentanyl strips to at-risk minority communities and refugee groups. The OD2A funding will allow the RREACT team to develop a comprehensive anti-stigma campaign for first responder personnel, including roundtable discussions with LE and EMS/Fire leadership and personnel, roll call videos for first responders, educational brochures, and awareness posters.\nCDC funds will support total compensation for one CIT trained peace officer; one part-time CFD paramedic and contract costs for program and grant management services. \nIn order to achieve project deliverables, RREACT requests legislative approval to waive bidding requirements and enter into a $60,000.00 service contract with Village Venture, LLC to provide program management, grant management and data analysis services.\nEMERGENCY ACTION: This ordinance is submitted as an emergency as to not delay program services and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: This ordinance authorizes the acceptance and appropriation of $280,941.00 in year one U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention award monies from Franklin County Public Health to fund expansion of RREACT outreach activities. The full term of the FCPH CDC OD2A project period is September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2028. This ordinance authorizes an appropriation of funds upon receipt of annual executed agreements.\nThis initiative does not generate any revenue nor require a City match.\n \nSub recipient Agreement Number: CDC OD2A (this is a federal award administered as a sub award via Franklin County Public Health):\n \n•                     Budget period: September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024 - $280,941.00\n•                     Project Period: September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2028    **Note: Year 2, 3, 4, 5 award funds to be appropriated to grant project account upon future receipt of annual executed contracts with FCPH \n•                     No City match required\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Public Safety Director to accept U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Overdose Data to Action program funding via a sub award from Franklin County Public Health (FCPH) in the amount of $280,941.00; to authorize the appropriation of award funds in the amount of $280,941.00 to the Public Safety Department for expansion of Rapid Response Emergency Addiction Crisis Team outreach activities from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grants Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $280,941.00; to authorize the Director of Public Safety to enter into a $60,000.00 service contract with Village Venture, LLC to continue program management, grant management and data analysis; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of City Code; and to declare an emergency.
