    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\n \nThis legislation is submitted to authorize the payment of attorneys’ fees, court costs, and pre-judgment interest in accordance with the Opinion and Order entered on June 4, 2024, in favor of Terry Scott Caskey, in the amount of Five Hundred Forty-five Thousand, Two Hundred Ten Dollars and Ninety-five Cents ($545,210.95).\n \nOn November 11, 2018, Columbus Police Officers Nathan Fenton and Charles Harshbarger observed a Nissan Altima stopped on Dana Avenue. The Officers then observed the Altima make a couple of minor misdemeanor traffic violations and initiated their lights and made two audible siren blasts to initiate a traffic stop. At this time, the Altima failed to stop and appeared to be fleeing from the Officers’ visible and audible signals to pull over. The Officers then observed the Altima make some dangerous driving maneuvers, including failing to wait for a vehicle in front of them to complete a turn before making its own turn, turning into a lane for travel in the opposite direction, and making a turn when others had the rights of way, causing other cars to stop to avoid a collision. While following the Altima, the Officers were able to observe the driver who matched the OHLEG photo of the car’s registered owner, Terry Caskey. This was enough for the Officers to believe that they had probable cause that a felony, Ohio Revised Code 2921.331(B), had occurred.  The Officers made a report and charges were presented to a Grand Jury who chose to indict Plaintiff Caskey. A warrant was then issued and Plaintiff Caskey was subsequently arrested for a third-degree felony Failure to Comply with an Order or Signal of Police arising from that November 11, 2018 incident. Plaintiff Terry Caskey spent five (5) nights in jail following this arrest and his criminal case was eventually dismissed.\n \nThe civil case went to trial against Officers Fenton and Harshbarger and presented two causes of action against each: (1) seizure without probable cause in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983; and (2) malicious prosecution claims in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983. A jury found in favor of the defendant officers on Plaintiff’s malicious prosecution claims but the jury found in favor of the Plaintiff as to both defendant officers on the unlawful arrest claims. The jury awarded $350,000.00 in compensatory damages and $0 in punitive damages. Ordinance 3272-2023, passed by Council on December 4, 2023, authorized payment of the jury award to Plaintiff Caskey. Post-trial, Plaintiff filed motions for Award of Attorneys’ Fees and for Prejudgment Interest as is authorized for claims made pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. On June 4, 2024, Judge Marbley granted Plaintiff’s motions and ordered the City to pay Four Hundred Thirty Thousand, Four Hundred Twenty-nine Dollars and Seventy Cents ($430,429.70) in attorneys’ fees and court costs and One Hundred Fourteen Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty-one Dollars and Twenty-five Cents ($114,781.25) in interest, totaling Five Hundred Forty-five Thousand, Two Hundred Ten Dollars and Ninety-five Cents ($545,210.95).\n \nFiscal Impact:\n                       \nThis ordinance authorizes the payment of attorneys’ fees, court costs, and interest assessed from the Opinion and Order entered on June 4, 2024, in the case Terry Scott Caskey v.
