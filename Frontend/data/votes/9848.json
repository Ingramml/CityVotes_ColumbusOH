    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nUnder 2291-2023, City Council entered into a grant agreement with The Garden Club Project (TGCP), a non-profit corporation. TGCP was founded by teen-preneur Te'Lario Watkins II of Tiger Mushroom Farms. The mission of TGCP is to help end hunger and encourage kids to eat healthier. TGCP has encouraged youth to grow food by donating over 300 seed kits to kids at farmers' markets & schools. Te'Lario also started a small garden for a local elementary school, from which over 300 pounds of food has been donated to families in need. Te'Lario also taught 30 students from the COSI Platform Program how to grow mushrooms and produce during the summer of 2023, thereby introducing students to careers in agribusiness. The grant funding awarded by Council in 2023 was to assist Te'Lario in expanding his urban farm by adding a high tunnel to extend the harvest season.\n \nTGCP was not able to use the grant funds awarded by Council in 2023 before the grant agreement expired, and consequently the grant funding was returned to Council in February of 2024. The purpose of this ordinance is to award the grant funding, once again, to TGCP in support of its mission and programming. Emergency designation is requested because the urban farm is at peak productivity during the summer and fall months, when funding will have the greatest impact.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available in the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Garden Club Project in support of their urban farming programming and expansion; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency. ($10,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Garden Club Project (TGCP) was founded by teen-preneur Te'Lario Watkins II of Tiger Mushroom Farms; and\n \nWHEREAS, The mission of TGCP is to help end hunger and encourage kids to eat healthier; and\n \nWHEREAS, TGCP is expanding its urban farm by adding a high tunnel to extend the harvest season; and\n \nWHEREAS, TGCP teaches students from the COSI Platform Program how to grow mushrooms and produce; and\n \nWHEREAS, An emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City insofar as it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with The Garden Club Project in support of their mission to grow food and build a high tunnel to expand growing capacity during the 2024 growing season, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.

That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
