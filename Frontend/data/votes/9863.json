    "description": "Title\n \nTo recognize The Addict’s Parents United (TAPU) and their 6th Annual More Than a Number event. \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Addict’s Parents United (TAPU) is a supportive community for parents with children that have drug and/or alcohol addiction and parents that have lost one or more children to this disease. \n \nWHEREAS, TAPU provides a safe space for parents to navigate through the consequences of their son’s/daughter’s disease of addiction.\n \nWHEREAS, the founders created a space for parents to come together using their personal familial experiences and passion to help others. \n \nWHEREAS, the vision of TAPU is to be one of the most trusted and compassionate groups for parents, offering continual support and resources.\n \nWHEREAS, TAPU provides three emotional support groups, to offer individuals compassion, sense of belonging, support, and peace. \n \nWHEREAS, the More than a Number event, a signature event of TAPU, is held not to focus on the pain and grief of losing a loved one but rather to celebrate and honor their lives.\n \nWHEREAS, the founders wanted to create this event to honor the parents, show support, and listen to the stories of their beloved children. \n \nWHEREAS, the event creates a nurturing afternoon for all attendees, filled with positivity, support, and uplifting messages from the TAPU community.\n \nWHEREAS, The Addict’s Parents United views those lost to addiction as more than just a number and strives to remember the person and support their loved ones - the parents who continue to share and love their child. NOW, THEREFORE,\nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council hereby celebrates and honors The Addict’s Parents United and their commitment to honoring those lost with the More Than a Number event.",
