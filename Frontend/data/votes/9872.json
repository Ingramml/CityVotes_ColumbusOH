    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend a contract with Booth Management Consulting, LLC to provide for the continuation of subrecipient monitoring professional services, technical assistance, and training for the remainder of the award term under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) - State Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF). \nThe City of Columbus received $187,030,138 from the US Treasury, with agreement to obligate ARPA-SLFRF by December 31, 2024 and to expend by December 31, 2026. The City has partnered with third parties to execute program or project scopes under SLFRF. These third parties are considered subrecipients of federal funds and subaward agreements were executed with the City. When the City issues a subaward to a subrecipient to carry out part of a Federal program, the City is required by Uniform Guidance 2 CFR Part 200.332 to ensure subrecipients comply with applicable federal laws and regulations and with the provisions of each subaward agreement. As the City has continued to execute subawards with SLFRF funds, the need has also continued for those funds to be monitored under the requirements of Uniform Guidance.\nThe City of Columbus utilized a Request for Proposals (RFP) process to identify and assess qualified Certified Public Accounting (CPA) firms to execute subrecipient monitoring services. Proposals were submitted in response to RFQ020261 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes, and Booth Management Consulting, LLC, received the highest overall score from the RFP committee. Ordinance 0197-2022 authorized the Director of Finance and Management to enter into contract with Booth Management Consulting, LLC, with the option to extend on a year-to-year basis for up to an additional three years. Booth Management Consulting houses the repository of the City’s SLFRF subrecipient monitoring documents, and is currently and actively engaged in the award monitoring process. The most efficient and cost-effective route for the City to maintain a continuation of services through the end of the federal award term, would be to modify the existing contract.\nBooth Management Consulting, LLC prepared a detailed analysis of current and future subawards to be monitored, and an increase amount to the existing contract was determined. The Department of Finance and Management is seeking authority to increase the amount of the contract in order to obligate SLFRF and to extend the contract to continue with uninterrupted services associated with subrecipient monitoring and technical assistance across the remainder of the SLFRF award term.\nBooth Management Consulting, LLC; Contract Compliance CC# 040075 Expires 11/08/2025\nFiscal Impact:  This contract is eligible for and will be funded by State Local Fiscal Recovery Fund and the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund.\nEmergency action is requested so that the existing contract can be modified immediately and subrecipient monitoring, technical assistance, and training can continue without delay due to the timing of federal reporting requirements.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management to modify and extend a contract with Booth Management Consulting, LLC, to provide subrecipient monitoring, technical assistance, and training related to the City’s administration of Federal Grant Awards; to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund and $650,000.00 from the Recovery Fund; and to declare an emergency ($800,000.00). \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City has a need for subrecipient monitoring, technical assistance, and training related to the City’s administration of Federal Grant Awards; and \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, utilized a Request for Proposals (RFP) process to identify and assess qualified firms; and\n \nWHEREAS, proposals were submitted in response to RFQ020261 in accordance with the relevant provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes pertaining to professional service contracts, and Booth Management Consulting, LLC received the highest overall score from the RFP committee; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to modify the existing contract with Booth Management Consulting, LLC to expand subrecipient monitoring professional services, as well as technical assistance, and training; and\n \nWHEREAS, it is necessary to authorize the expenditure of $150,000.00 from the Emergency Rental Assistance Fund (2208) and $650,000.00 from the Recovery Fund (2209); and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Finance and Management in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to modify an existing contract with Booth Management Consulting, LLC to provide subrecipient monitoring, technical assistance, and training so that such activities can continue without delay due to the timing of federal reporting requirements, for the preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW THEREFORE,  \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Finance and Management is hereby authorized to modify an existing contract with Booth Management Consulting, LLC to provide subrecipient monitoring, technical assistance, and training services related to Federal Grant Awards.
