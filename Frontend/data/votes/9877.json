    "description": "Explanation\n \n1. BACKGROUND:  This Ordinance authorizes the Director of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the contract with K & W Roofing, Inc., for the City Facilities Roof Repairs 2023 project, in the amount of $50,000.00.\n \nThis modification (#1) will authorize additional scope and funding to remove and replace the entire roofing system at Police Substation #9 located at 3022 Winchester Pike, Columbus, OH 43232.  The original scope for Police Substation #9 was to only perform minor repairs but excessive repairs warranted the need for the roof to be completely removed and replaced.\n \nThe original contract (PO422531) was authorized by Ordinance No. 3060-2023 and approved by City Council on December 4, 2023. \n \n1.1  The amount of additional funds to be expended under the modification: $50,000.00.\n \n1.2  Why the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded.   The original scope of Police Substation #9 was to only do minor repairs but excessive repairs warranted the need for the building to be completely re-roofed which requires additional funding.\n \n1.3 Why it would not be in the city's best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes?  The roof actively leaks when it rains and immediate repairs should be performed to prevent further damage and safety concerns to the building.  Procuring another vendor would add at least 3+ months for repairs to be performed.\n                     \n1.4 How the price for the additional goods or services which are the subject of the modification was determined.  The City received a quote from K & W Roofing for this additional scope and was approved by the project manager.\n \n2. CONTRACT COMPLIANCE INFO:  DAX #5659, expires 2/8/26, WBE/EBE- certified\n \n3.

FISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $50,000.00 from the General Fund with K & W Roofing, for roof repair services at Police Substation #9 as part of the Office of Construction Management’s City Facilities Roof Repairs 2023 project. \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Finance and Management, on behalf of the Office of Construction Management, to modify and increase the contract with K & W Roofing, Inc. for the City Facilities Roof Repairs 2023 project; to authorize an expenditure of $50,000.00 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency.
