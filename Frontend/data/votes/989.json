    "description": "Explanation \n \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes: the Director of Public Service to accept deposits from White Castle Management Company (White Castle) to be used for construction inspection and administration for Roadway - Reach Boulevard & Generations Pass and SR 315 project; the establishment of an Auditor Certificate Direct Invoice (ACDI) for the payment of construction inspection and administration services for the project; and the expenditure of funds on construction inspection and administration services relative to the project.  It also authorizes the refund of any unused funds deposited by White Castle for construction inspection and administration for this project upon the completion of final accounting for the Roadway - Reach Boulevard & Generations Pass and SR 315 project or when the Department of Public Service determines remaining funds are no longer needed for construction inspection and administration for the project.\n \nThe aforementioned project, which will be administered by White Castle, will culminate in the construction of a new public roadway and other public infrastructure improvements, including intersection improvements at West Goodale Street, Reach Boulevard, and S.R. 315, and additional turn lanes to the S.R. 315 exit ramps at that intersection. The Department of Public Service will be performing construction administration and inspection services relative to that effort.\n \nOrdinance 0047-2021 authorized the execution of a Construction Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement Agreement, effective January 29, 2021, between the Department of Public Service and White Castle, which required White Castle to deposit inspection funds with the City. White Castle recently deposited $172,903.57 with the City Treasurer to support the performance of construction administration and inspection services. The purpose of this legislation is to make said funds available for use. This ordinance also authorizes, as necessary, the issuance of a refund of any unexpended inspection funds or the acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of additional inspection funding should the actual cost of said services exceed the sum available for that purpose without requiring additional legislative action. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding in the amount of $172,903.57 has been received from White Castle for the inspection expenses and deposited in Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Non-Bond Fund, Project P531020-100000 (Roadway - Reach Boulevard & Generations Pass and SR 315).  It is necessary to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to establish sufficient budget authority for this project. The funds need to be appropriated.\n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the aforementioned project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to accept and appropriate funds from White Castle for construction inspection and administration services in connection with the Roadway - Reach Boulevard & Generations Pass and SR 315 project; to authorize the expenditure of $172,903.57 from the Street and Highway Improvement Non-Bond Fund; to refund unused construction inspection and administration funds upon final acceptance of work; and to declare an emergency.

and \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the appropriation and expenditure of requisite funds to support the performance of construction administration and inspection services so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the aforementioned project, thereby preserving the public health, peace, property, safety, and welfare;
