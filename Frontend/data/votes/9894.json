    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThe United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) has issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for approximately $44.6 million in discretionary grant funding through the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program (ATIIP) Grant Program.  This is the first round of funding for the ATIIP grant program.  The NOFO was released on March 19, 2024.  It will remain open through July 17, 2024.\n \nSection 11529 of BIL established ATIIP to provide discretionary grants to eligible entities to plan, design, and construct eligible projects that provide safe and connected active transportation infrastructure in an active transportation network or active transportation spine (BIL § 11529(a)).  The ATIIP projects will help improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of active transportation networks and communities; improve connectivity between active transportation modes and public transportation; enhance the resiliency of on- and off-road active transportation infrastructure and help protect the environment; and improve quality of life in disadvantaged communities through the delivery of connected active transportation networks and expanded mobility opportunities.  The ATIIP grants will allow communities to identify, prioritize, and implement improvements to the largest barriers to safe, accessible, and equitable pedestrian and bicycle network connectivity through the development of infrastructure that will provide substantial additional opportunities for walking and bicycling. Eligible organizations will be able to create plans or implement active transportation networks that connect destinations within or between communities or create plans or implement an active transportation spine connecting two or more communities, metropolitan regions, or States. The ATIIP also provides an opportunity for eligible organizations to enhance their overall transportation network by integrating active transportation facilities with transit services, where available, to improve access to public transportation.\n \nThe City meets the criteria to be eligible to submit an ATIIP planning grant application.  The Department of Public Service is working with the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC) to develop a planning project that will (1) identify the remaining active transportation alignments and facilities necessary to complete a regional active transportation network with Downtown Columbus and the Capital Line as a hub, and (2) pilot MORPC’s Central Ohio Greenways (COG) Trail Town Ambassador Training Program.  The Department estimates the total planning project cost will be approximately $1.4 million, and it intends to request up to 80% of the future eligible project costs in ATIIP funding from USDOT.\n \nThis legislation will authorize the Director of Public Service to formally apply for an ATIIP program planning grant.  It also authorizes the execution of agreements with USDOT, MORPC, or others in connection with the application for the grant, the award of the grant, the expenditure of grant funds, and the return of unused grant funds if any should remain at the end of the grant.\n \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nATIIP grants may be used for up to eighty percent (80%) of future eligible project costs.  No financial participation is required at this time.  City funds will be approved in the form of design contracts and/or construction contracts that will be or have been submitted for Council's approval.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested to provide the Department of Public Service with the authorization to proceed with an application prior to the application period’s end.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to apply for and accept if awarded an Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program Planning Grant from the United States Department of Transportation; to authorize the execution of grant and other requisite agreements with the United States Department of Transportation and other entities providing for the acceptance and administration of said grant award on behalf of the City of Columbus, Department of Public Service; to authorize the expenditure of any awarded funds and the refund of any unused funds; and to declare an emergency.  ($0.00)\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced the first round of funding for the Active Transportation Infrastructure Investment Program (ATIIP), which is a grant program to be awarded on a competitive basis;

and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council approval is needed to apply for and accept the grant funding; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Public Service in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director to prepare and submit the aforesaid grant application prior to the end of the application period, for the immediate preservation of the public health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Public Service be and is hereby authorized to submit an application seeking grant funding from USDOT’s ATIIP program; to accept said grant, if awarded; and to execute a grant agreement and any other documents necessary to effectuate said applications, acceptance, or agreement on behalf of the Department of Public Service.\n \nSECTION 2.  That the Department of Public Service be and hereby is authorized to expend any awarded grant funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of said grant.\n \nSECTION 3.  That, at the end of the grant period, or upon request of the grantor, any repayment of unencumbered balances required by the grantor is hereby authorized and any unused City match monies may be transferred back to the City fund from which they originated in accordance with all applicable grant agreements.\n \nSECTION 4.  That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
