    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:\n \nThe City of Columbus, Department of Public Service, received a request from the Department of Finance and Management asking that the Department of Public Service vacate a 50’ by 20’ portion of the north/south right-of-way known as West Capital Street.  \n \nThe right-of-way area is adjacent on the western side of the City-owned PID 010-299751 and adjacent on the eastern side of the City-owned PID 010-066883 and separates these two parcels.  Vacating this area of the right-of-way will allow the City to combine its two existing parcels and facilitate construction of a parking area to support the operation of the City’s Pre-K known as the Hilltop Early Learning Center.  \n \nPer current practice, comments were solicited from interested parties, including City agencies, private utilities and the applicable area commission, before it was determined that, subject to the retention of a general utility easement for those utilities currently located within the right-of-way, the City will not be adversely affected by vacating this portion of right-of-way.\n \nThe Department of Public Service has agreed to vacate the asset as described and shown within the attached legal description and extinguish its need for this public right-of-way. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: No funding is required by this legislation.\n \nEMERGENCY JUSTIFICATION:  Emergency action is requested to allow the Department of Public Service to timely vacate the right-of-way to allow the City to combine two city-owned parcels at the earliest possible date and allow the Pre-K parking project to proceed on schedule.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Public Service to execute those documents necessary to vacate a 0.023 acre portion of right-of-way known as West Capital Street to the Department of Finance and Management; and to declare an emergency.
