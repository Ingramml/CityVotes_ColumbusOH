    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program. The Clean Ohio Conservation Fund is accepting applications for funding to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors. If awarded, the funding will be used to acquire properties for preservation of the City’s natural resources. \n \nOPWC administers statewide grant funding to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors and this ordinance authorizes an application for 2024 Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program grant funds only. OPWC requires that a resolution, ordinance, or other written documentation to obligate funds for the project as part of the application. This ordinance is a commitment to provide the necessary match funds at a later date to satisfactorily complete the proposed project and become eligible for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the grant. If the grant funding is awarded, future legislation will follow to authorize acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of City funds. \n \nThis grant application is intended to secure funding towards fee simple acquisition of various sites in Columbus, including 6.4 acres of woodlands in North Linden and 42 acres in the City’s Greater Hilltop Community.\n \nCooke Woods Preservation Project - North Linden:\nThis project will acquire 6.4 acres of mature woodlands in the North Linden community. The parcels are directly adjacent to the acquisition of five acres of Cooke Woods purchased by the Recreation and Parks Department in 2022. If the grant is approved and a successful transaction is completed, the entire 11 acres of forest canopy will be preserved, which protects the largest remaining undisturbed woods in North Linden.  \nWhitethorne Woods - Greater Hilltop:\nThis project will acquire 42 acres of natural area on the southeast edge of the Greater Hilltop area. These parcels are along the Eakin Road, Whitethorne Avenue, and Rea Avenue corridors. There are approximately 91 parcels that will be included in the acquisition, with most being historic platted lots that were never developed. In 2024, the owner of the properties contacted Recreation and Parks to gauge interest in preserving them as forested habitat. The sites are surrounded by dense, older neighborhood developments. Additionally, over 5,600 residents live within 10 minutes of the properties. This acquisition would protect the largest remaining woodland natural area in Greater Hilltop. \nPrincipal Parties: \nOhio Public Works Commission\nClean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program, Clean Ohio Conservation Fund - District 3\n65 East State Street, Suite 312\nColumbus, Ohio  43215\nLinda Bailiff, (614) 752-6829\n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is being requested to meet the application deadline of August 30, 2024. \n \nBenefits to the Public: Protection of the City’s high quality waterways, greenway corridors, ravines, and urban forests is of great benefit to current and future generations. These sites are within rapidly urbanizing areas of the city and preservation of key natural sites is one of the main missions of Recreation and Parks. Conservation of the sites proposed relies heavily upon outside funding assistance to achieve these benefits.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: During the past decade, residents in these communities, and the city at large, have expressed strong priority for more greenspaces, protected stream corridors access to nature, walking paths, and urban forest conservation.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Greater Hilltop (53), North Linden (40) \n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks’ Master Plan by protecting the environmental health and resilience of the City’s waterways. It will provide long term protected corridors for walking, biking, and outdoor experiences while improving the equitable access to trails and greenways.\n \nFiscal Impact: No fiscal action is required at this time. Future legislation will accept, appropriate, and encumber funding for this project as needed if the grant is awarded.\nTitle\nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to apply for grant funding from the Ohio Public Works Commission (OPWC) Clean Ohio Conservation Fund to preserve natural areas and greenway corridors, including fee simple acquisition of two separate sites on Cooke Road, in the city's North Linden community, and along Eakin Road, in the city's Greater Hilltop community; and to declare an emergency.
