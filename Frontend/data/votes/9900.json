    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground: This ordinance authorizes the Director of the Recreation and Parks Department to modify an existing contract with Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. to provide professional services associated with the Three Creeks Wetland Restoration Project. The modification amount being authorized by this ordinance is $25,800.00.\n \nThree Creeks Park is a 1,097 acre park in the Far South Community and is jointly managed by the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department and Franklin County Metro Parks. Three Creeks Park was historically farmed, but wetlands have been developing over the past decade as the land has naturally converted from agricultural use. It is important that the Recreation and Parks Department restores the wetlands at Three Creeks Park, as approximately 90 percent of all wetlands in Ohio have been lost. Wetlands improve water quality, provide flood control, serve as critical habitat for a variety of wildlife, and capture carbon dioxide. \n \nAfter the initial scope of design services was negotiated with the consultant and submitted to Council for approval, the Recreation and Parks Department received a notice from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources requiring a Phase 1 archaeological survey for two locations on the project site. The State Historic Preservation Office identified two pre-contact American Indian sites that need to be mapped within the project area before preliminary engineering can begin. This study must be completed as a requirement to utilize the grant funding for construction.\n \nPrincipal Parties: \nCivil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. \n250 West Old Wilson Bridge Road, Suite 250\nWorthington, OH 43085                                            \nBradley Petru, (614) 540-6633\nContract Compliance Number: 001963                                \nContract Compliance Expiration Date: 6/11/26                     \n \nEmergency Justification: Emergency action is requested in order complete the design plans and bid the construction project on schedule, meeting the grant funding deadline of March 31, 2026.\n \nBenefits to the Public: This project will improve water quality, flood controls, and serve as a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. It will also provide access to additional recreation for the community.\n \nCommunity Input/Issues: The community, Far South Area Commission, and the Williams Creek HOA has expressed support for the wetland restoration and will continue to be involved during the design phase of the project.\n \nArea(s) Affected: Far South (64)\n \nMaster Plan Relation: This project will support the Recreation and Parks Master Plan by conserving, protecting, and enhancing the City’s natural resources and overall environmental health, benefiting current and future generations of residents.\n \nFiscal Impact: The expenditure of $156,843.35 was legislated for professional services in conjunction with the Three Creeks Restoration Project by Ordinance 0723-2024. This ordinance will provide funding that will modify the previously authorized amount by $25,800.00. $25,800.00 is budgeted and available from within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund 7747 to meet the financial obligations of this contract modification. The aggregate total amount authorized, including this modification, is $182,643.35.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of Recreation and Parks to modify an existing contract with Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. for the Three Creeks Wetland Restoration Project; to authorize the appropriation of $25,800.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the transfer of $25,800.00 within the Recreation and Parks Permanent Improvement Fund; to authorize the expenditure of $25,800.00 from the Recreation and Parks Voted Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
