    "description": "Explanation\n \nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to modify a professional services contract with Warhol & Wall St Ltd by adding an additional $5,300.00 to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the City of Columbus zoning code changes by creatively supporting the “Zone In Gallery”. \n \nOriginal Agreement                     $50,000.00                                          Ord. # 1042-2024                                          PO447762\nModification # 1                      $  5,300.00\nTotal                                                               $55,300.00\n \nIn April, the City of Columbus introduced a proposal to modernize the zoning of Columbus corridors. This will be the city’s first comprehensive effort to update its zoning code in more than 70 years.  In order to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the code changes, the city is sponsoring the creation of a “Zone In Gallery”, the gallery is an interactive space where residents can learn: \n•                     Why our 70-year-old code is due for a change to match the needs of our growing city\n•                     The steps taken to develop a proposal for modernized zoning\n•                     What the proposed zoning would look like in your neighborhood\n•                     How the proposed zoning code updates will help build housing, grow our use of transit, support new and existing businesses and more.  \n \nThe Zone in Gallery will be open six days a week during the proposal’s public comment period.  This modification will allow staff to continue to operate the gallery to allow more residents the opportunity to learn about the code changes.   \nWarhol & Wall St Ltd began the creative development and fabrication (including educational displays, explanatory collateral, furniture rental and other supportive tasks to execute this concept) on the Zone In Gallery project as a sub-contractor to the Lisa Wise Consulting contract, originally authorized by Ord # 1041-2022, and the contract was later extended under the authorization of Ord # 0867-2024 TO mAY 8, 2025.  The scope of the gallery creation exceeds Warhol’s budgeted scope within the Lisa Wise Consulting contract.  \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  The vendor number is 018718 and contract compliance expires on 2/10/2025.\n \nEMERGENCY DESIGNATION:  An emergency ordinance is requested in order to continue the work that is already in progress, and emergency action is necessary to avoid any disruption in services.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding of $5,300.00 is available within the General Fund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify a professional services contract with Warhol & Wall St Ltd to add additional funding in an amount up to $5,300.00 from the General Fund to continue to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the City of Columbus zoning code changes; to authorize expenditures prior to the Purchase Order; and to declare an emergency. ($5,300.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City undertook an independent analysis of the Zoning Code and process, which determined that the current code does not support our community’s shared aspiration to be an equitable, thriving city; and\n \nWHEREAS, an updated Zoning Code is an important tool in proactively managing growth; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Building and Zoning entered into a contract with Lisa Wise Consulting, for the provision of professional consulting services, authorized by Ord # 1041-2022; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Building and Zoning modified the original agreement with Lisa Wise Consulting to extend the contract term, authorized by Ord # 0867-2024; and\n \nWHEREAS, in April, the City of Columbus will introduce a proposal to modernize the zoning on Columbus corridors. This will be the city’s first comprehensive effort to update its zoning code in more than 70 years; and \n \nWHEREAS, in order to educate Columbus residents and stakeholders on the code changes, the city is sponsoring the creation of a “Zone In Gallery”, and will be open six days a week during the proposal’s public comment period; and\n \nWHEREAS, Warhol & Wall St Ltd began the creative development and fabrication (including educational displays, explanatory collateral, furniture rental and other supportive tasks to execute this concept) on the Zone In Gallery as a sub-contractor to the Lisa Wise Consulting contract ; and\n \nWHEREAS, the scope of the gallery creation exceeds Warhol & Wall St Ltd’s budgeted scope within the Lisa Wise Consulting contract; and\n \nWHEREAS, the modification will allow staff to continue to operate the gallery to allow more residents the opportunity to learn about the code changes; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists such that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to modify the existing contract with Warhol & Wall St Ltd to add additional funding to continue the work that is already in progress and emergency action is necessary to avoid any disruption in services, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
