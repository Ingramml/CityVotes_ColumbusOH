Easton Place Homes Phase II is located directly south of the market rate townhomes facing Easton Way, which is the southern boundary of the premier retail/restaurant/entertainment district in Columbus. Major employers, such as JPMorgan Chase and Huntington Bank, employ thousands within walking distance-census data from 2018 indicates 24,000 jobs within a mile of the site-making this an extremely convenient location in all respects. \nThis grant agreement would provide $750,000.00 for cost increases that have arisen and would further supplement the Capital funds previously granted totaling $6,050,000.00; $2,250,000.00 coming from the 2021 Capital Budget, $2,550,000.00 coming from the 2022 Capital Budget, and $1,250,000.00 from the 2023 Capital Budget. This legislation would authorize the use of funds to pay for eligible costs, including soft costs, which may have been incurred prior to the establishment of the project's purchase order, making those pre-award costs eligible for reimbursement if needed. \nEmergency justification is requested for this ordinance as this project is currently under construction.  \n \nFISCAL IMPACTS\nThis ordinance authorizes an expenditure of $750,000.00 in the Neighborhood Partnerships Capital Fund. \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 004842 and expires 03/24/26.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation of $750,000.00 within the Neighborhood Capital Partnerships Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Columbus Housing Partnership, Inc.
