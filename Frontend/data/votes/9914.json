    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   Ordinance 0453-2024 provided funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC)’s who provide primary health services not provided at Columbus Public Health. This ordinance amends 0453-2024 to provide an additional $485,000.00 in funding for FQHC’s as follows: \n \nColumbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc. dba PrimaryOne Health: $235,079.50\nHeart of Ohio Family Health Centers: $87,397.00\nLower Lights Christian Health Center, Inc.: $79,249.00\nSoutheast, Inc.: $58,297.00\nThe Ohio State University College of Nursing: $16,005.00\nLutheran Social Services of Central Ohio: $8,972.50\n \nCommunity Health Centers (CHC) are successful, low-cost options for primary care access in a nation that spends $2 trillion a year on health care. Medical costs for CHC patients are 41% lower compared to patients seen elsewhere such as a hospital emergency room. As a result CHC’s save the health care system between $9.9 billion and $17.6 billion a year.\n \nWhy the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded? To continue to serve additional clients and continue primary health services not provided at Columbus Public Health.\n \nWhy it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter? All six FQHC’s in Columbus has a currently serve large caseloads of clients and it would be a disservice and lack of continuity of care for the clients being served under this contract.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to not delay these needed services for the community.\n \n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funding is provided in the Health Special Revenue Fund and the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to amend contracts with the following vendors: Columbus Neighborhood Health Center, Inc.
