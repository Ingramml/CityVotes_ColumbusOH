    "description": "Explanation\nThis ordinance authorizes the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Help and Hope Community Center in support of the Youth Empowered initiative.\n \nHelp & Hope Community Center is a non-profit organization that addresses the unique needs of youth and the well-being of the community through education, healthcare, and connecting needs to resources. Youth Empowered is a collaboration between Health and Hope Community Center, Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services, Community for New Direction, Columbus Urban League, IMPACT Community Action, and PrimaryOne Health.\n \nThe purpose of Youth Empowered is to address the rise in youth truancy, violence, and petty crime. The program intends to enroll 40 youths and young adults in a 6-month program with weekly workshops dedicated to conflict resolution, life skills, personal health, and financial literacy, among other topics. Impact will be evaluated through participant surveys and by gauging progress that participants make on academic assessments and grade cards. It is expected that connecting these vulnerable youths to necessary resources will result in fewer incidents of truancy and delinquency.\n \nFiscal Impact: Funding is available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to provide Help and Hope Community Center with the resources necessary to implement the Youth Empowered initiative without delay.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with Help and Hope Community Center in support of the Youth Empowered initiative; to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund; and to declare an emergency.
