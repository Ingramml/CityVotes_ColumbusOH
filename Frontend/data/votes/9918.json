    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:   This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Life Sparx LTD dba The MORE Life Partnership for trauma services for the period of April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026 in an amount not to exceed $477,960.00 for a new contract amount of $882,800.00.\nThis is the third modification to the original underlying contract authorized by Ordinance 0748-2022. The first modification to increase the original contract amount and extend the end date was authorized by Ordinance 0965-2023, the second modification to extend the end date was authorized by Ordinance 0782-2024.\n \nWhy the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded? To continue to serve additional clients and continue mental health & trauma social media campaign. MORE Life has provided exceptional services to the community thus far centered around healing from trauma and increasing community resiliency\n \nWhy it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter? MORE Life has a current caseload of clients and it would be a disservice and lack of continuity of care for the clients being served under this contract.\n \nHow was the price for these additional goods or services determined? Initial RFP outlined pricing & services. Discussion & quote was provided by the vendor. Due to ARPA limitations, the contract was extended through December of 2026. Current cost reflects the increase needed to continue services during this time period.\n \nLife Sparx LTD is a nonprofit entity and is exempt from contract compliance certification.\n \nEmergency action is being requested in order to approve this ordinance prior to the current contract end date of August 31, 2024 and allowing these essential trauma counseling and grief support services to continue uninterrupted for our most vulnerable communities.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $477,960.00 is budgeted in the Health Special Purpose Fund for Trauma services with established faith-based organizations in the community.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Life Sparx LTD dba The MORE Life Partnership, for continued trauma services with established faith-based organizations for the period of April 1, 2022 to December 31, 2026; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $477,960.00 from the Health Special Purpose fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency.  ($477,960.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need for continued trauma services with established faith-based organizations; and\n \nWHEREAS, Life Sparx LTD dba The MORE Life Partnership has the expertise and resources required to carry out these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Life Sparx LTD dba The MORE Life Partnership in order to approve this ordinance prior to the current contract end date of August 31, 2024 and allow these essential trauma counseling and grief support services to continue uninterrupted for our most vulnerable communities, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized  to modify an existing contract with Life Sparx LTD dba The MORE Life Partnership for the period of September 1, 2024 to December 31, 2026 in an amount not to exceed $477,960.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the costs of said contract, the expenditure of $477,960.00 is heareby authorized from the Health Special purpose fund, Fund No. 2209, Department No. 50, Division 5001,\n \nSECTION 3.  That this contract is in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these contract modifications are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the city's financial records.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
