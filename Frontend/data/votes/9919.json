    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  This ordinance authorizes the Board of Health to modify an existing contract with Think Make Live Youth for gun violence intervention services in an amount not to exceed $86,000.00 for a new contract amount of $152,000.00. Columbus Public Health has a need to continue culturally sensitive community-based gun violence intervention programming that addresses high risk behaviors to decrease gun violence that occurs in the city. The program is expected to be a yearlong intervention, with weekly group sessions that offer services to target individual’s specific needs. The contract period is from July 18th, 2023 to September 30, 2025.  \n \nThis is the first modification to the original underlying contract authorized by Ordinance 1874-2023. This contractor is a nonprofit organization and is exempt from certification. These services were advertised through Bonfire (RFQ024375) according to bidding requirements of the City Code.\n \nWhy the need for additional goods or services could not be foreseen at the time the contract was initially awarded? This contract modification will allow the program to expand to include more sites\n \nWhy it would not be in the city’s best interests to have the additional contract requirements awarded through other procurement processes specified in this chapter? We would like to expand the current pilot program Guns Down, which is set to end July 18, 2024.\n \nHow was the price for these additional goods or services determined? This amount was determined by the salaries and fringe benefits for employees to work new sites.\n \nEmergency action is being requested in order to approve this ordinance prior to the current contract end date of July 18, 2023 and allowing these essential gun violence intervention services to continue uninterrupted for our most vulnerable communities.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: $86,000.00 is budgeted in the Health Special Purpose Fund for gun violence intervention services. \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Board of Health to modify an existing not-for-profit service contract with Think Make Live Youth for gun violence intervention services for the period of July 18th, 2023 to September 30, 2025; to authorize the expenditure not to exceed $86,000.00 from the Health Special Purpose fund to pay the costs thereof; and to declare an emergency.  ($86,000.00).\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Board of Health has a need for gun violence intervention services; and\n \nWHEREAS, Think Make Live Youth has the expertise and resources required to carry out these services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Columbus Public Health in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Board of Health to modify an existing contract Think Make Live Youth  in order to approve this ordinance prior to the current contract end date of July 18, 2024 and allow gun violence intervention services to continue uninterrupted for our most vulnerable communities, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, safety and welfare; NOW THEREFORE, \n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Board of Health is hereby authorized  to modify an existing contract with gun violence intervention services for the period of July 18th, 2023 to September 30, 2025 in an amount not to exceed $86,000.00\n \nSECTION 2.  That to pay the costs of said contract, the expenditure of $86,000.00 is heareby authorized from the Health Special purpose fund, Fund No. 2209, Department No. 50, Division 5001,\n \nSECTION 3.  That this contract is in compliance with Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Code.\n \nSECTION 4.  That the funds necessary to carry out the purpose of this ordinance are hereby deemed appropriated, and the City Auditor shall establish such accounting codes as necessary.\n \nSECTION 5.  That the City Auditor is authorized to make any accounting changes necessary to ensure that these contract modifications are properly accounted for and recorded accurately on the city's financial records.\n \nSECTION 6.  That for reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
