    "description": "Explanation\n \nThe Columbus City Attorney’s Office is seeking approval for a new contract with Access Information Management Corporation (referred to as \"Access\") to settle an outstanding invoice for record storage, retrieval, destruction, and related services provided during the months of February-April 2024. This legislation grants the City Attorney the authority to pay outstanding accounts with Access from the previous 2023-2024 contract, which ended on February 29, 2024.\n \nBACKGROUND: The Columbus City Attorney’s Office entered into a contract with Access on March 1, 2023 for records storage and related services, with services capped at $25,000.00. However, due to unforeseen increases in storage and management needs, the contract was later modified to allow for a maximum payment of $33,000.00.  This estimate, however, fell short due to unforeseen demands. Consequently, the City Attorney’s Office seeks authorization to enter into a short-term contract to cover the remaining balance of $447.88 from the February invoice, and $4,461.66 for March-April 2024.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  The amount of the contract is $4,909.54. This contract is funded by the General Fund.\n \nOriginal Contract amount: $25,000.00 PO383315 (term: 3/1/2023-2/29/2024)\nContract modification: $8,000.00 PO422933 (Ord. 3366-2023)\nTotal contract amount: $33,000.00\nContract balance: $2,559.79\nRequire an additional $4,909.54 to pay invoice dates February-April 2024\n \nCOMPANY: Access Information Management Corporation, FID: 04-3408536, CC027849, expires 12/23/2023 \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Attorney to enter into contract with Access Information Management Corporation; to authorize the expenditure of $4,909.54 from the General Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($4,909.54)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the City Attorney has identified the need to enter into a new contract with Access Information Management Corporation (\"Access\") to resolve outstanding invoices for record storage and related services in an amount up to $4,909.54; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the City Attorney’s Office in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the City Attorney to enter into a new contract with Access Information Management Corporation because insufficient funds remain under the contract to pay overdue invoices, and a new contract is immediately necessary to pay the amounts owed all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the City Attorney be and is hereby authorized to enter into a new contract with Access Information Management Corporation in the amount of $4,909.54. Reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting February 1, 2024, is authorized.\n \nSECTION 2. That for the purposes stated in Section 1, the expenditure of $4,909.54 or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby authorized in Fund 1000 (General Fund), 24-2401 (City Attorney), in object class 03 (Purchased services) per the accounting codes in the attachment to this ordinance. \n \nSECTION 3.

That the City Auditor is authorized to establish such accounting codes as necessary, to make any accounting changes to revise the funding source for all agreements, contracts, or modifications associated with this ordinance.\n \nSECTION 5. That for the reasons stated in the preamble hereto, which is hereby made a part hereof, this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure because insufficient funds remain under the contract and shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and approval by the Mayor, or ten days after passage if the Mayor neither approves nor vetoes the same.",
