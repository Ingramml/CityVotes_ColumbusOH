($50,000.00)",
    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThe Association of Prosecuting Attorneys is a national 501(c)(3) established in 2009 as a professional association of elected and appointed prosecutors dedicated to leading nationwide training, technical assistance and private grant funded justice initiatives. In October of 2022, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (APA) selected the Columbus City Attorney’s Office to serve as a pilot site for their prosecutor-involved, low-level theft deflection program. APA is now investing $50,000.00 in private grant dollars to support the City Attorney’s Buckeye Diversion and Deflection programs. \n \nThrough these programs, non-violent misdemeanor offenders are eligible for criminal diversion. If individuals opt to participate, they work with prosecutors, defense counsel and Health Impact Ohio Community Health Workers to develop diversion case plans tailored to their unique needs. Health workers use a validated social determinants of health screen to identify challenge areas and develop plan conditions. These conditions are designed to address issues at the root cause of criminal behavior with the goal of addressing the current situation and preventing future justice involvement i.e. issues related to basic needs (lack of housing or food), physical health, mental health, substance use, lack of employment and/or childcare. Plans are signed by the participant, attorney/Public Defender and City Prosecutor. Once plans are signed by all parties, Community Health Workers provide guided case management services to support participants in achieving agreed upon conditions. \n \nThis legislation authorizes the City Attorney to accept and use APA award funding to modify/increase the existing contract with Health Impact Ohio from $46,209.20 to $96,209.20 and enter into a sole source contract with Health Impact Ohio for guided case management services. Health Impact Ohio utilizes the proprietary Central Ohio Pathways HUB allowing Community Health Workers to effective manage comprehensive case management plans within one system and bill Medicaid for eligible participants thereby reducing total program costs. There is no other vendor in Central Ohio offering access to the Pathways HUB, therefore it is in the City’s best interest to move forward with this contract modification. Contract funds cover case management services for criminal deflection and diversion participants who are not eligible for Medicaid. Services are billed at the Medicaid reimbursement rate and a schedule of reimbursements is available upon request. The City Attorney sought additional grant funds to modify/increase our current contract because the number of non-Medicaid eligible residents served through deflection and diversion is much higher than originally anticipated. \n \nThe City Attorney’s Office requests authorization to accept the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys $50,000.00 private grant award for criminal deflection and diversion services; to authorize appropriation of $50,000.00 within the private grant fund; to authorize the use of grant funds to modify/increase the office’s current contract with Access HealthColumbus d/b/a Health Impact Ohio from $46,209.20 to $96,209.20 for case management for deflection and diversion participants; to authorize a sole source contract with Health Impact Ohio's; and to authorize the expenditure of $50,000.00 from Private Grants Fund 2291.\n \nCurrent vendor/contract information:\n§                     Vendor Name: AccessHealth Columbus doing business as Health Impact Ohio \n§                     Vendor Number: CC-008966 | EBO Exp 4/21/2025\n§                     Contract Amt: $46,209.20\n§                     Purchase Order: PO387014 & PO436939 \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:\nNone.
