    "description": "Explanation \n \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes: 1) the Director of Public Service to accept deposits from NWD Investments LLC (NWD) to be used for construction inspection and administration for the Pedestrian Safety Improvements - John H McConnell Boulevard Sidewalk project; 2) the establishment of an Auditor Certificate Direct Invoice (ACDI) for the payment of construction inspection and administration services for the project; and 3) the expenditure of funds for the aforementioned purpose.  It also authorizes the refund of any unused funds deposited by NWD for construction inspection and administration for this project upon the completion of final accounting for the Pedestrian Safety Improvements - John H McConnell Boulevard Sidewalk project or when the Department of Public Service determines remaining funds are no longer needed for construction inspection and administration for the project.\n \nThe aforementioned effort will culminate in the construction of sidewalk along the west side of John H McConnell Blvd north of Spring Street to New Public Lane. Other improvements will include curb ramps, curb, retaining wall, street trees, lighting, and may include storm water drainage improvements.  NWD will oversee the construction of the project, and the Department of Public Service will perform the requisite construction administration and inspection services relative to that effort.\n \nNWD recently deposited $59,770.40 with the City Treasurer to support the performance of those services.  An ordinance authorizing the execution of a Construction Guaranteed Maximum Reimbursement Agreement with NWD will be submitted to Council for approval at a later date.  The purpose of this legislation is to make said funds available for use. This ordinance also authorizes, as necessary, the issuance of a refund of any unexpended inspection funds or the acceptance, appropriation, and expenditure of additional inspection funding should the actual cost of said services exceed the sum available for that purpose without requiring additional legislative action. \n2.  FISCAL IMPACT\nThe City has received funding in the amount of $59,770.40 from NWD for the inspection expenses and deposited said funds in Fund 7766, the Street and Highway Non-Bond Fund, Project P590105-100453 (Pedestrian Safety Improvements - John H McConnell Boulevard Sidewalk).  It is necessary to amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget to establish sufficient budget authority for this project.  The funds also need to be appropriated.\n \n3.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency action is requested so as to prevent unnecessary delays in the completion of the aforementioned project.\n \nTitle\n \nTo amend the 2020 Capital Improvement Budget; to accept and appropriate funds received from NWD Investments LLC for construction inspection and administration services in connection to the Pedestrian Safety Improvements - John H McConnell Boulevard Sidewalk; to authorize the expenditure of $59,770.40 from the Street and Highway Improvement Non-Bond Fund; to refund unused construction inspection and administration funds upon final acceptance of work; and to declare an emergency.
