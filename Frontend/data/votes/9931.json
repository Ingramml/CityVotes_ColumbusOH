Two (2) bids, by majority vendors, were received. The bids were deemed responsive and were evaluated on November 28, 2023. The committee recommended that Bricker Graydon LLP be awarded the contract. The committee determined their proposal was best because of their strong project team with well-defined project goals, the team’s broad expertise and experience, and their clear project strategy for taking advantage of the tax credit incentives.\n \nThe term of the contract is from date of execution until such time as the need for outside legal counsel concludes.
