    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:\n \nThe Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States has selected six students from Columbus State Community College (CSCC) to participate in a highly prestigious 14-day study abroad program focused on sustainability. With support from the FACE Foundation, L’Oreal Fund for Women, and the Borchard Foundation, these boot camps have been running since 2017. Last year, two students from CSCC studied in Nancy and La Ciotat. With Council's support, this year, six special Central Ohio students will be able to participate in a life-changing learning experience and bring those insights back to Columbus. Students will attend 14-day boot camps over the summer. Six students will participate in three different learning opportunities:\n \nOne student selected: Some Like it Sustainable, organized by Université de Montpellier, France, June 2nd - June 15th, 2024.\n \nThree students selected: Beyond the Postcard: nature, culture, and sustainability in the French Caribbean, organized by Université des Antilles, July 1st - July 14th, 2024.\n \nTwo students selected: Sustainable Engineering organized by Ecole Supérieure des Technologies Industrielles Avancées (ESTIA) in Bidart, June 10th to June 23rd, 2024.\n \nThis unique opportunity will increase students' cultural awareness, social awareness, job marketability, scientific literacy, and sustainability knowledge, as well as build community and demonstrate for prospective students the opportunities that attend a CSCC education. Students will document their travels via photography, a boot camp project and a personal reflection essay. Each boot camp has a major project the students complete.\n \nThe intent of this legislation is for Council funds to support scholarships that reimburse participating students for expenses related to their study abroad programs, including airfare, travel insurance, and passport application and processing fees. Participating students, upon their return, will be asked to present their final projects and speak to their experience generally. City Council believes that by supporting these students, the City can learn from their studies of sustainability efforts in other parts of the world and perhaps apply those lessons to our City's sustainability efforts in particular the City's Climate Action Plan that will benefit the City as a whole.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT: Funds are available within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund, subfund 100018.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Clerk to enter into a grant agreement with the Columbus State Community College Development Foundation, Inc. in support of a sustainability-focused study abroad opportunity for students of Columbus State Community College selected by the French Embassy; and to authorize an appropriation and expenditure within the Neighborhood Initiatives subfund. ($6,000.00)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, The Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States has selected six students from Columbus State Community College to participate in a highly prestigious 14-day study abroad program focused on sustainability; and\n \nWHEREAS, Students will attend 14-day boot camps over the summer located in France and the French Caribbean; and\n \nWHEREAS, This unique opportunity will increase students' cultural awareness, social awareness, job marketability, scientific literacy, and sustainability knowledge, as well as build community and demonstrate for prospective students the opportunities that attend a Columbus State Community College education; and\n \nWHEREAS, City Council seeks to support students of environmental sustainability studies, including those who have participated in the aforementioned study abroad programs, in order to learn from their findings and research, as well as to apply their experience to the improvement and fulfillment of the City's Climate Action Plan; and NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.
