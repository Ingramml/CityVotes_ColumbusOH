    "description": "Explanation\n1.                     Background\nAs authorized by Ordinance 2235-2014, the City issued its $205,425,000 Sewerage System Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2014, dated December 1, 2014 (the “2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds”). It is now advantageous for the City to refund all or a portion of the outstanding amount of the 2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds through the Ohio Water Development Authority (“OWDA”) Refinance Loan Program. \n \nIn order for the City Auditor to apply for and enter into a Refinance Loan Program Loan Agreement, the OWDA requires legislation authorizing the City Auditor to do so. This ordinance authorizes the City Auditor to apply for and execute a Refinance Loan Program Loan Agreement for the refinancing of the 2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds. \n \n2.                     Fiscal Impact\nThe OWDA Loan Administration Fee will be rolled into the total loan amount of the loan. The loan will be paid off from revenues from sewer system rates (the dedicated source of repayment). Sewer rate increases have been projected and planned in anticipation of this loan.\n \n3.                     Emergency Designation\nThe Refinance Program Loan Application is now being processed for this refinancing loan. This authorizing legislation is a requirement for loan approval and must be submitted to the OWDA as a part of the Loan Application process prior to consideration by the OWDA Board for loan award. Emergency designation is requested for the purpose of refunding the 2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds expeditiously to take advantage of current interest rates.\n \nTitle\nTo authorize the City Auditor to apply for, accept, and enter into an Ohio Water Development Authority Refinance Loan Program Loan Agreement, for the purpose of providing funds to refund certain outstanding special obligations of the City; to designate a dedicated source of repayment for the loan; to authorize an expenditure of $200,000.00 in the Sewer Operating Fund for costs of issuance; and to declare an emergency ($143,100,000.00).\n \nSection 44-1(b)\n \nBody\n                     \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus, Ohio (the \"City\") owns and operates as a public utility a municipal sewerage system (the \"Utility\"), the services of which are, and are to be, supplied to persons and corporations within and without the corporate limits of the City; and\n \nWHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance 2235-2014 passed by City Council (the “Council”) of the City and a Master Trust Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2008, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Trust Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2008, a Second First Supplemental Trust Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2008, and a Third Supplemental Trust Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2014, each by and between the City and the Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, the City issued its $205,425,000 Sewerage System Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2014, dated December 1, 2014 (the “2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds”) for the purpose of refunding certain outstanding special obligation bonds of the City which were originally issued to provide funds to expand and improve the Utility and to refund bonds previously issued for such purpose; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City Auditor is scheduled to prepare a Loan Application for submittal to the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) under the Refinance Loan Program to refinance all or a portion of the outstanding amount of the 2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds, which are currently outstanding in the principal amount of $141,900,000, which will achieve a reduction in the debt service associated with the 2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds and will promote the purposes of the Utility; and\n \nWHEREAS, prior to Loan Agreement approval by OWDA, the Refinance Loan Program application documents require the City to submit to OWDA a certified copy of approved Council legislation authorizing the City Auditor to apply for and subsequently execute the Loan Agreement, on the terms set forth in the Cooperative Agreement (defined below) (the “Refinancing”); and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operations of the City Auditor’s Office, in that it is immediately necessary to adopt this Ordinance to timely authorize the City Auditor to enter into a Refinance Loan Program Loan Agreement with OWDA to achieve a reduction in the debt service associated with the 2014 Sewer Revenue Bonds, all for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, or safety; NOW, THEREFORE, \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\nSection 1.                     That this Council hereby authorizes the City Auditor to apply for, accept, and enter into the Refinancing with OWDA under the provisions, terms and conditions set forth in the “Cooperative Agreement for the Refinancing of a State Water or Wastewater Project” (the “Cooperative Agreement”) and the “Refinance Loan Program Loan Agreement” (the “Loan Agreement”), the forms of which are on file with the City Auditor’s Office.
