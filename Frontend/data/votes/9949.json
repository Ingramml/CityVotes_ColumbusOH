    "description": "Explanation\n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Service to enter into a professional services contract with Data Ticket, Inc. relative to the Citation Processing Management System and Permit Management System.\n \nIn 2022, the Department of Public Service, Division of Mobility & Parking Services, formerly known as the Division of Parking Services, issued a Request for Proposals to facilitate the development and implementation of the Citation Processing Management System and Permit Management System, resulting in a contract award to Data Ticket pursuant to Ordinance 3182-2022 for that purpose. The term of that agreement recently expired, necessitating the execution of a new service contract between the parties. The intent of this legislation is to provide the Division of Mobility & Parking Services with additional resources necessary to the continued operation of the Citation Processing Management System and Permit Management System.  This legislation seeks to authorize the execution of a one-year service contract between the parties terminating no earlier than May 31, 2025, with annual contract modifications anticipated through 2028. \n \nThis ordinance also requests approval to continue services provided by Data Ticket, in accordance with sole source procurement provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; as it has been determined that Data Ticket is the sole proprietor and manufacturer of the equipment, expertise and software needed to manage the citation processing and permit management system.\n \n3.  CONTRACT COMPLIANCE\nData Ticket, Inc.’s contract compliance number is CC042414 and expires July 12, 2024.  \n \n4.  FISCAL IMPACT\nFunding for this contract is available within Fund 6500, the Mobility Enterprise Operating Fund.  \n \n5.
