    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\nThis legislation authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract with Black Bronco Construction LLC, in an amount up to $1,200,000.00 to provide residential lead abatement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program utilizing SLRF grant funding from the State of Ohio.  The term of this contract shall be through the program year 2026 with the option to renew for one (1) additional year. \n \nThe Department of Development applied for grant funding for the Lead-Safe Housing Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) grant from the State of Ohio Department of Development and was awarded funds totaling $5,356,000.00 which was approved by City Council via Ordinance 3209-2023.  The Department of Development has partnered with the Department of Public Utilities and they are utilizing $1,000,000.00 of the funding to assist homeowners in removal/remediation of lead pipes within their homes.  \n \nThe Lead Safe Ohio-ODOD funding operated by the City's Housing Division allows lead-safe home renovations. The primary goal of establishing funding is to assist low- and moderate-income owners with primary prevention and to reduce immediate and presumed lead hazards in residential properties built before 1978. Awarded  contractors will perform the lead safe renovations such as, but not limited to, roof replacements, framing to soffits, fascia, rakes, rafters, and trusses as necessary; installation of gutters/downspouts, repair of porch structure; and wrapping or painting of soffits, fascia, and rake boards. \n \nThe Department of Development advertised RFQ027423 on Vendor Services and proposals were received through Bonfire seeking contractors to provide lead safe abatement services for residential properties on April 10, 2024 with bids being due on May 7, 2024.  The Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program is a State funded lead abatement program operated by the Housing Division.  \nEmergency action is requested to continue performing the needed services for residents as quickly as possible and to comply with the terms of the grant from the State of Ohio.  Funding must be obligated quickly otherwise; the funding will be subject to claw back. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding is available within the ODOD LEAD Grant (G442400) Fund budget for this purpose.  \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  \nBlack Bronco Construction LLC, vendor number 011955 and expires 2/16/2025.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a contract in an amount up to $1,200,000.00 with Black Bronco Construction LLC, to provide residential lead safe abatement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program; to authorize the expenditure of $1,200,000.00 from the General Government Grant Fund; and to declare an emergency. ($1,200,000.00)\n \n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program was established to assist low and moderate income homeowners with lead abatement services that would impact a household remaining safely in their home; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Department of Development has advertised Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program requesting pricing from contractors to provide lead safe abatement services; and \n \nWHEREAS, the Director of Development will enter into a contract with Black Bronco Construction LLC to carry out program services; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Department of Development in that it is immediately necessary to enter into contract with Black Bronco Construction LLC as there exists no current lead safe abatement contractor to provide services under the Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program, without which, residents of these households, who cannot afford the expense of services, may not be able to remain in their homes, and to comply with the terms of a grant from the State of Ohio, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property, and safety; NOW, THEREFORE,\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1.  That the Director of the Department of Development be and is hereby authorized to enter into a contract, in an amount up to $1,200,000.00, with Black Bronco Construction LLC, to provide residential lead safe abatement services as part of the Division of Housing’s Lead-Safe Home Renovations Program.
