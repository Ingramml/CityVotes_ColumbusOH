    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the National Church Residences for the construction of Bretton Woods Phase II in an amount up to $1,700,000.00.  National Church Residences will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  Bretton Woods II Senior Housing Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of the project with National Church Residences being one of the managing members.\n \nNational Church Residences proposes the new construction of Bretton Woods Phase II, the 60-unit second phase of a senior housing community with on-site supportive services located on Cleveland Avenue, a 1st Tier Transit Corridor. Bretton Woods Phase II is located in the Northland neighborhood of Columbus, a CelebrateOne Neighborhood. Bretton Woods Phase II will feature an onsite fitness area and residents will also benefit from easy access to local amenities such as grocery stores, parks, schools, and the nearby Gillie Senior Recreation Center and the brand new Central Ohio Primary Care (COPC) SeniorSelect primary care center. A COTA Rapid Transit stop is located adjacent to the site. This phase of the project is funded with 4% LIHTC, the newly created Ohio Low Income Housing Tax Credit along with city funding.\n \nThis senior housing community will offer 60 one-bedroom units with 24 units affordable to residents at or below 50% AMI and 36 units affordable to residents at 60% AMI. Furthermore, we would require the senior applicants to meet all other requirements included in our Tenant Selection Plan, with the exception of denying seniors whose only negative background check infraction is eviction due to non-payment of rent.\n \nBretton Woods Phase II will consist of one building with 60 one-bedroom apartments units. Each unit will have a separate kitchen, bathroom, living area, and bedroom. At least eight (8) of the units will meet Section 504 accessibility standards. In addition, National Church Residences will incorporate building design features to enable residents to age in place including but not limited to accessible means of egress/ingress for each unit, 36” door widths, lever handles, and facets, clear floor space of 30” x 50”, and accessible locations of lighting and environmental controls. The building will also incorporate sustainable design practices and methods in accordance with OHFA’s Green Policy.\n \nAlthough this project will not have an on-site Service Coordinator, residents will still benefit from some of the programming and resources that the Service Coordinator in Phase I will put together. Some of these resources will include services that promote health, wellness, and quality of life to prolong independent living for individuals with varying levels of health.  Phase I of the project consists of 62 senior units previously funded with 9% LIHTC, $600,000 in City HOME funds and other OHFA funding.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the construction schedule and to fulfill financing needs prior to closing deadlines with the developer’s other lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $1,700,000.00 is available in 2023 Capital Improvement Budget, Affordable Housing Bond fund. \n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 032683 and expires 08/01/2024.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with National Church Residences in an amount up to $1,700,000.00 in support of the Bretton Woods Phase II development; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,700,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
