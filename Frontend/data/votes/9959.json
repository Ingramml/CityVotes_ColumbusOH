    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement with the Hudson Investment Fund V, LLC for the acquisition and redevelopment of 163 units across four sites in downtown Columbus in an amount up to $1,250,000.00.  Hudson Investment Fund V, LLC will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  The Topiary Park Apartments, LLC is the ownership entity of the project and child entity under Hudson Investment Fund V, LLC. Approval is also requested for reimbursement of expenses incurred prior to execution of the purchase order, starting January 1, 2023.\n \nThe Topiary Park Apartments, LLC project involves the acquisition and redevelopment of a scattered site portfolio that consists of 163 apartment units across 4 sites in downtown Columbus. Pursuant to the acquisition, a land use restrictive agreement (LURA) was recorded ensuring that 40% of the rental units are limited to a maximum of 80% of AMI, 60% of the rental units are limited to a maximum of 60% of AMI, and any rent increases to current residents are limited to a maximum of 4% per year.\n \nThe redevelopment plan includes a multifaceted approach to ensuring affordability while improving quality and addressing deferred maintenance. The priority for this project is to provide safe, well-maintained, energy-efficient, accessible and affordable housing to residents, many of whom work in the community, rely on access to public transit, and wish to continue to call downtown Columbus home.\n \nThe terms of the LURA ensure that these residents, who would otherwise have limited housing options due to the rapidly rising cost of living both in Columbus and nationwide, have access to quality residences at levels well below market rents. The Topiary Park Apartments, LLC project represents an important opportunity to improve downtown affordability, given the well-known challenges in developing affordable housing units due to the rising cost of construction within the region. \n \nPer Vogt Strategic Insights, the Topiary Park Apartments, LLC and Market Mohawk Apartments, LLC projects combined represent a 74% increase in deed-restricted affordable housing in the Downtown CRA District at a time when market rate development is increasingly unable to produce affordable housing at scale.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the construction schedule and to fulfill financing needs prior to closing deadlines with the developer’s other lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $1,250,000.00 is available in the Affordable Housing Bond Fund. A transfer of cash between projects is required to establish sufficient authority for the project.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 048436 and expires 03/13/2026.\n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement with Hudson Investment Fund V, LLC in an amount up to $1,250,000.00 in support of the Topiary Park Apartments, LLC project; to authorize the expenditure of up to $1,250,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the reimbursement of expenditures incurred prior to the establishment of a purchase order; and to declare an emergency.
