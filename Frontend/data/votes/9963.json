    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND\n \nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of the Department of Development to enter into a grant agreement Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the renovation of Country Ridge property in an amount up to $2,000,000.00.  Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority will enter into a grant agreement with the city for the bond funds as a pass-through entity.  CMHA Country Ridge LLC is the ownership entity of the project and Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority is a general member.  \n \nCountry Ridge is currently an affordable housing community consisting of (96) units with a (50) unit Project Based Voucher HAP Contract that is owned by Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority. The development is located at 5656 Farmhouse Lane, Hilliard, Ohio 43026. The project consists of (48) two-bedroom units and (48) three-bedroom units and built in 1998. At the time it was developed by National Church Residences, the city made a HOME loan to the project for $1,152,000.00 which with interest had increased to approximately $2,400,000.00 when it was forgiven by the Columbus City Council in 2023.  Upon the recapitalization of this development, it will be monitored by OHFA for 30 years.\n \nRenovations to Country Ridge will include new kitchen and baths, flooring, appliances, HVAC, water heaters, window treatments, siding, windows and roofs.\n \nAll residents will have access to CMHA’s RISE Center.  CMHA's RISE Center serves as a centralized hub that provides access to valuable community resources for CMHA residents. The RISE Center can help you coordinate access to supportive services in the following four areas: Economic Empowerment, Educational Advancement, Health & Wellness, and Character & Leadership.\n \nSome examples of available services include: Applying for emergency rental assistance, utility bill payment plans, and understanding your lease agreement. Signing up for health insurance, unemployment, and food assistance. Finding employment, housing, medical care, and educational opportunities. Managing health and well-being, including understanding illnesses and medications. Family planning, pregnancy care, and care for the entire family.\n \nEmergency action is requested in order to maintain the construction schedule and to fulfill financing needs prior to closing deadlines with the developer’s other lenders.  Without emergency action, new affordable housing would be further delayed from a low-income community in urgent need of it.\n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  Funding in the amount of $2,000,000.00 is available in the Affordable Housing Bond fund. A transfer of cash is necessary.\n \n \nCONTRACT COMPLIANCE:  the vendor number is 006216 and expires 09/08/2025.\n \n \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the City Auditor to transfer funds within the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; to authorize the Director of Development to enter into a grant agreement Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority for the renovation of Country Ridge property in an amount up to $2,000,000.00; to authorize the transfer and expenditure of up to $2,000,000.00 from the Affordable Housing Bond Fund; and to declare an emergency.
