    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Columbus Division of Police was awarded funding through the FY23 Sexual Assault Kit Funding Grant Program (SAK) through The State of Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services (OCJS). The City must be a subgrantee to the State of Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services to participate in this program according to the federal grant guidelines.  Therefore, the Mayor is required to sign a subgrantee award to accept this grant on behalf of the City.  This federally supported program seeks to reimburse state and/or local law enforcement to conduct investigations on sexual assault kit testing and related expenses. The Columbus Division of Police currently has 315 sexual assault kits awaiting transfer for laboratory analysis. This grant funding will allow the Columbus Division of Police to collaborate with The Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) that will allow 175 kits to be transferred to BCI for analysis, reporting and entry into the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). \n \nThe official city program contact authorized to act in connection with this $350,000.00 grant is Sergeant Kyle Fishburn.  The grant award start date is May 1, 2024 and ends December 31, 2024.\n \nIn order to achieve project deliverables, we request legislative approval to: \n \n1) Enter into a $350,000.00 contract with The Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation to transfer and process 175 backlogged sexual assault kits for analysis. These specific laboratory services are only available through the Laboratory Division of The Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation. The contract with BCI is necessary because specific laboratory services under the contract are not available through the City of Columbus. \n \nEmergency Designation:  Emergency legislation is necessary to meet the State of Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services processing deadline and to allow the financial transactions to be posted to the City’s accounting system as soon as possible for the grant award, as the grant start date was May 1, 2024. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:  This ordinance authorizes an acceptance of the $350,000.00 grant award and the appropriation of those funds from the Office of Criminal Justice Services to transfer and process sexual assault kits for The Columbus Division of Police. This is a new award for the City of Columbus. This initiative does not generate any revenue nor require a City match.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Mayor of the City of Columbus, on behalf of the Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, to accept the FY23 Sexual Assault Kit Funding Grant Program award from the State of  Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services; to authorize an appropriation of $350,000.00 from the unappropriated balance of the General Government Grant Fund 2220; to authorize the Director of the Department of Public Safety to enter into a $350,000.00 contract with The Attorney General’s Office, BCI, for specific laboratory services related to sexual assault cases; to waive the competitive bidding provisions of Chapter 329 of the Columbus City Codes; and to declare an emergency.
