    "description": "Explanation\n \nBACKGROUND:  The Division of Police needs to purchase two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers (FTIR) to be used for the identification of controlled substances at the Police Crime Laboratory.  The current FTIR systems were purchased in 2007 and 2011 and have been deemed obsolete and no longer serviceable by the manufacturer.  However, the Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) accessories used for direct sampling with the FTIR and Spectrum software used to operate the FTIR are current and supported.  Since the FTIR are routinely used to analyze submitted drug evidence, it is imperative replacement FTIR systems are able to seamlessly integrate with the current ATR Accessories and Spectrum software purchased to avoid casework disruption; therefore we are requesting a bid waiver as PerkinElmer US LLC is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the FTIR system that is fully capable of utilizing the existing Perkin Elmer ATR accessories obtained by the Crime Lab on May1, 2024.  \n \nBid Information:   These items are manifestly impractical to bid because PerkinElmer US LLC is the only manufacturer and distributor of the FTIR system that will be compatible with the current ATR accessories and spectrum software the crime lab procured on May 1, 2024.  \n \nPerkinElmer US LLC is not debarred according to the Federal excluded parties listing or prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State unresolved findings for recovery certified search.\n \nContract Compliance No:  CC-045842 expires 6/29/2025\n \nEmergency Designation: Emergency legislation is requested in order to expedite the purchase so the equipment may be placed in service for the Police Crime Lab as soon as possible to prevent delay of evidence processing and to procure the items prior to the grant end date. \n \nFISCAL IMPACT:   This legislation authorizes an expenditure of $68,904.24 for the purchase of two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers for the Police Crime Lab funded by the General Government Grant Fund.  There is no impact on the General Fund for this purchase.\n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize and direct the Finance and Management Director to enter into a contract for the purchase of two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers (FTIR) from PerkinElmer US LLC for the Division of Police Crime Lab in accordance with the provisions of Columbus City Code; to authorize the expenditure of $68,904.24 from the General Government Grant Fund; to waive competitive bidding and to declare an emergency. ($68,904.24)\n \nBody\n \nWHEREAS, the Division of Police Crime Lab needs to purchase two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers (FTIR) for the identification of controlled substances; and\n \nWHEREAS, This purchase was budgeted in the General Government Grant Fund; and \n \nWHEREAS, It is in the best interest of the City to enter into this contract in accordance with bid waiver provisions of Section 329 City of Columbus Codes, 1959; and\n \nWHEREAS, an emergency exists in the usual daily operation of the Division of Police, Department of Public Safety, in that it is immediately necessary to authorize the Director of Finance and Management to purchase two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers from PerkinElmer US LLC to prevent delay in processing evidence and procure the equipment prior to the grant end date, all for the immediate preservation of the public health, peace, property safety, and welfare; now, therefore\n \nBE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS:\n \nSECTION 1. That the Finance and Management Director be and is hereby authorized and directed to enter into contract with PerkinElmer US LLC. for the purchase of two Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometers (FTIR) for the Division of Police Crime Lab.\n \nSECTION 2.
