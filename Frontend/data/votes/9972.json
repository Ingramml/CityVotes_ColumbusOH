    "description": "Explanation\n \nBackground:  This legislation will authorize the City Attorney to enter into contracts with collection agents Capital Recovery Systems, Inc., Law Offices of Robert A. Schuerger Co., LPA, and Linebarger, Goggan, Blair & Sampson, LLP for initial three (3) year terms each, with the option of two additional one (1) year extensions, and will authorize payment of court costs, and the reimbursement of any overpayments collected from the Collection Fees fund. This fund is generated by fees collected by collection agents and used to pay the associated collection costs due. \n \nThe accounts receivables collection program within the City Attorney's Claims Section has been ongoing since 1996. On March 15, 2024, the City of Columbus Purchasing Office on behalf of the City Attorney issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ 027214) for collection services and received a total of six (6) responses.  A five-member Selection Committee reviewed the proposals, and of the six (6) responses, three (3) companies were invited to give presentations and to further discuss their qualifications.  After thorough review and consideration, the Selection Committee recommended that the City Attorney enter into contracts with the three (3) collection agencies listed above.  \n \nIn 2009, Ordinance 0130-2009 authorized a program which adjusted the fee structure of the city's debt collection program.  Effective April 1, 2009, the ordinance created a new fee to be added to the total debt collected on all new and existing accounts without payment plans. This additional fee allows the city to recover one hundred percent (100%) of the debts collected, and the debtor pays the additional collection fee.  This program will continue under the contracts with the chosen collection agents.\n \nEmergency:  Emergency declaration is requested so the collection process can continue without interruption.\n \nContract Compliance Numbers:\nCapital Recovery Systems, Inc., 31-1570459, CC005578 expires 04/16/2026\nLaw Offices of Robert A. Schuerger Co., LPA, 35-2353532, CC017436 expires 01/09/2026\nLinebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson, LLP, 74-2864602, CC010047 expires 04/18/2025\n \nThese companies are neither debarred according to the Excluded Party Listing System of the Federal Government nor prohibited from being awarded a contract according to the Auditor of State Unresolved Findings for Recovery Certified Search.\n \nFiscal Impact:  These contracts are self-funding and will result in additional revenues to the general fund.  The collection agents are paid fees from the money they collect. One hundred percent (100%) of monies collected are remitted to the city, and invoices from the collection agencies are paid from the funds collected.  \n \nTitle\n \nTo authorize the appropriation and expenditure of up to $3,800,000.00 from the Collection Fees fund; to authorize the City Attorney to enter into contracts with Capital Recovery Systems, Inc., Law Offices of Robert A.
