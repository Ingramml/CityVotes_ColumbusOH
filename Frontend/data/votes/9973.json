    "description": "Explanation    \n1.  BACKGROUND\nThis ordinance authorizes the Director of Public Utilities to enter into a construction contract with Complete General Construction Company via the City’s Invitation for Bid process for the Moler Street Overflow Intercepting Sewer and the Moler Street Area Water Line Improvements project, CIP #650763-100000 & 690236-100151, in an amount up to $39,944,314.89; and to encumber funds with the Department of Public Service for construction administration services in an amount up to $2,000.00, for a total expenditure of $39,946,314.89.\n \nThe City of Columbus and the State of Ohio entered into a consent order in August of 2002 to resolve sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) related concerns for the City’s sanitary sewer system.  The consent order requires the City to develop and implement a program to provide adequate capacity in the collection system, taking all feasible steps to address SSO’s.  This is one of the projects implemented to comply with the consent order as identified in the Integrated Plan and 2015 Wet Weather Management Plan Update Report.  The improvements must be substantially completed by July 1, 2025, to comply with the consent order.  It is needed to mitigate combined sewer overflows that discharge into the Scioto River and to address Water in Basement occurrences in the Moler Street area.  \n \nThe work for this project includes installation of approximately 1,844 feet of new 12”/18”/24”/72”/96” storm sewer; 25 structures (curb inlets/catch basins/manholes); 789 feet tunnel for 96” storm pipe; 196 feet jacked liner for 18” storm pipe; 823 feet of new 2”/4”/6”/8” water main; water service lines; pavement planing or replacement; and modification of existing combined sewer overflow (CSO) regulators.  This project will redirect Moler Street Regulator combined sewer overflows that discharge to the Scioto River into the Olentangy-Scioto-Interceptor-Sewer Augmentation Relief Sewer (OARS).  OARS redirects wet weather overflows that currently empty into the Scioto River and carry the flows instead to the city’s Jackson Pike and Southerly wastewater treatment plants.  The project will also redirect the Moler Street Storm Sewer to convey stormwater flow to the Scioto River by flowing north along High Street and west along Gates Street.  This redirected Moler Street Storm Sewer will address Water in Basement occurrences within the Moler combined sewer area.\nThe Community Area for this ordinance will be “63 - South Side”.  \n \nTIMELINE:  All work shall be substantially complete by June 30, 2025, with final completion to occur by December 31, 2025. The City anticipates issuing a Notice to Proceed on or about August 1, 2024.\n \nESTIMATED COST OF PROJECT:  The bid amount and proposed award amount is $39,944,314.89, including a 15% construction contingency amount that will be utilized to fund needed and approved changes in the work.  No contract modifications are anticipated at this time; however, construction exigency might later compel modification of this contract if unforeseen difficulties are encountered.\n \nCost summary: \n \nOriginal Contract                                  $39,944,314.89\nFuture Anticipated Needs                                   $0.00 \nPrevailing Wage Services                         __$2,000.00\nTOTAL                                               $39,946,314.89\n \n2.  ECONOMIC IMPACT/ADVANTAGES; COMMUNITY OUTREACH; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS/ADVANTAGES OF PROJECT\nThis project will redirect Moler Street Regulator combined sewer overflows that discharge to Scioto River into OSIS Augmentation and Relief Sewer (OARS) Shaft 3. When constructed, the Moler Street Overflow Intercepting Sewer will convey both Moler St. regulator combined sewer overflows and South Side Interceptor sewer wet weather flows into OARS Shaft 3. Also included is the design to redirect Moler Street Storm Sewer to convey Stormwater flow to the Scioto River by flowing north along High Street and west along Gates Street.  The redirected Moler Street Storm Sewer will address Water in Basement occurrences with future inflow redirection within the Moler combined sewer area.\n \n3.  CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT AWARD\nAn Invitation for Bids for the

anticipated to be financed with a loan from the Water Pollution Control Loan Fund (WPCLF), a program jointly administered by the Ohio EPA's Division of Environmental and Financial Assistance and the Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA).  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of funding via Ordinance 2767-2023, passed by Council on 10/30/2023.  The loan is expected to be approved in August, 2024. \nFunds will need to be appropriated within the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund, Fund 6102, transferred to the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, and then appropriated in the Sanitary Revolving Loan Fund, Fund 6111, in order to fund this expenditure.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until such time as the division is able to execute a loan with the WPCLF and reimburse the Sanitary Sewer Reserve Fund.  \nFunding in the amount of $2,000.00 is appropriated and available within the Sanitary Bond Fund, Fund 6109, to pay the Department of Public Service to provide prevailing wage services for this project.  The funds are appropriated.  It is necessary to transfer cash and appropriation between projects within the Sanitary Bond Fund to align cash and appropriation with the proper project.\nDivision of Water Construction Funding\nFunding for this contract will be obtained through the Ohio Water Development Authority Direct Loan Program.  City Council authorized this loan application and acceptance of loan funding via Ordinance 0652-2024, passed by Council on 03/25/24.  \nThe Ohio Water Development Authority (OWDA) Direct Loan Program is a reimbursement program.  Purchase orders will need to be established to Complete General Construction Company for these contracts.  Public Utilities will need to pay invoices directly to Complete General Construction Company, and then submit reimbursement requests based upon these paid invoices to OWDA for OWDA to reimburse Public Utilities.\n   \nA transfer of funds from the Water Reserve Fund, Fund 6003, to the Water Fresh Water Market Rate Fund, Fund 6014, is needed to fund this contract.  This transaction is a temporary measure that is required until a loan is executed with OWDA to reimburse the Water Reserve Fund.  The loan is expected to be approved in July, 2024.  These funds will also need to be appropriated to be transferred and then appropriated after transfer to the new Fund. \n \n8.  EMERGENCY DESIGNATION\nEmergency designation is requested for this ordinance.
