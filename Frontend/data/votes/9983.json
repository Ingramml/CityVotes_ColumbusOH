    "description": "Title\nTo recognize and celebrate Lisa Boggs as a champion of the Hilltop Neighborhood and the City of Columbus\n \nBody\nWHEREAS, Lisa Boggs has lived and cared for the Hilltop Neighborhood for over 20 years; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ms. Boggs started with picking up a few pieces of trash in her yard but would eventually transform into a neighborhood movement that is improving the quality of life and the environment for thousands of residents and the community at-large; and\n \nWHEREAS, Ms. Boggs responded to the litter issue by organizing her neighbors, building a strong community network of volunteers, and getting people organized to do their part in the community that they all call home; and\n \nWHEREAS, in 2024, the South Central Hilltop Spring Cleanup held its 22nd cleanup-it would have been the 23rd if not for taking a year off due to the COVID pandemic in 2020; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Hilltop neighborhood where Lisa lives is one of the largest neighborhoods in the City of Columbus with over 25,000 households; and\n \nWHEREAS, the Hilltop is one of the most diverse communities in Central Ohio and is beginning to be revitalized through the continued hard work and dedication of residents like Lisa Boggs; and\n \nWHEREAS,  Lisa Boggs has helped pick up thousands of pounds of litter through her Lunch Time Clean-ups, the South Central Hilltop Spring Cleanup, and other community events; and\n \nWHEREAS, she is a tireless advocate who won’t rest until the dream of a clean Hilltop is achieved and she is going to bring as many individuals into that dream to make it happen; and\n \nWHEREAS, while Lisa would never ask for this honor, her years of volunteering, community pride, and successful cleanups have helped transform the Hilltop in more ways than one. She is extremely deserving of this resolution as it would highlight her continued efforts that are critical to our neighborhoods; and \n \nWHEREAS, the City of Columbus is grateful for advocates like Ms. Boggs; and \n \nWHEREAS, this Columbus City Council will greatly miss Lisa Boggs and looks forward to supporting her in her next endeavor; and \n \nBE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS: That this Council does hereby recognize and celebrate Lisa Boggs as a champion of the Hilltop Neighborhood and the City of Columbus.",
