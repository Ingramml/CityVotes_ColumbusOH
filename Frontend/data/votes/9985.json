    "description": "Explanation\nBACKGROUND\nThe City of Columbus, Auditor’s Office conducted a Request for Proposals (RFP) in accordance with Columbus City Code Section 329.28 for supplemental professional consulting and technical services for Dayforce, our enterprise-wide benefits administration, payroll, personnel management, and employee self-service system. These professional services are needed to augment City staff and to provide solution consulting by furnishing Dayforce technical experts and functional resources on an as needed basis. \nThe City is in need of specialized product and industry knowledge for optimizing use of the product in alignment with industry best practices. The City contracts with Dayforce value added services for some of these items; however, there is often a backlog or delay in assigning resources as Dayforce is rapidly expanding its user base and these resources are in high demand for implementation. Dayforce has expanded its capabilities by introducing a partner network certified in system integration and Dayforce consulting. \nThe City Auditor’s Office prepared and released the RFP on January 8, 2024. The bid was advertised in the City Bulletin and on the City’s Vendor Services website as well as notifications sent to 137 vendors registered for information technology consultation services in the same system. In addition, the City’s Auditor’s Office notified eight (8) Dayforce partners directly via email or through their contact web pages. The partners were sourced using Dayforce’s published Partner Network on its website. A total of 145 vendors were solicited in the following Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI) classifications as follows: \n\n\n\nODI Certification\n\nCount of Solicited Vendors\n\n\n\nEBE\n\n16\n\n\n\nMBE\n\n28\n\n\n\nVBE\n\n3\n\n\n\nWBE\n\n10\n\n\n\nMAJORITY/Publicly held\n\n88\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n145\n\n\n \nFive (5) responses were received by the proposal submission deadline, February 15, 2024 and all offers were from majority owned or publicly traded companies. The evaluation committee ranked all offerors based upon the criteria identified in the RFP- (1) The quality and feasibility of the Offeror's technical proposal; (2) The ability of the offeror to perform the required service competently and expeditiously as indicated by the offeror's workload and the availability of necessary personnel, equipment and facilities; (3) The competence of the Offeror to perform the required service as indicated by the technical training, education and experience of the Offeror’s personnel who would be assigned to perform the work (4) Past performance of the Offeror as reflected by evaluations of the city agency, other city agencies and other previous clients of the Offeror with respect to such factors as quality of work, success in controlling costs, and success in meeting deadlines; and (5) pricing for services. \nThe evaluation committee was comprised of two (2) members of Auditor’s Office Dayforce Admin Team and one (1) member from the Department of Health. Health’s Human Resource Manager participated on the evaluation as it is reviewing its use of technology and some of the items under review are related to improving its use of Dayforce functionality. \nInitial rankings of all offerors were as follows:\n\n\n\nCompany Name\n\nRanking\n\n\n\nEnforce LLC\n\n4\n\n\n\nKAM Consulting Inc dba ClearCourse Consulting\n\n1\n\n\n\nOnActuate Consulting US Inc.\n\n2\n\n\n\nRSM US LLP\n\n3\n\n\n\nVintage Hill Consulting LLC\n\n5\n\n\n \nThe top three (3) highest qualified offerors were selected with which to hold additional discussions. All offerors were notified of the selection and names of the top three. Each of the top three offerors were given the opportunity to virtually meet with the evaluation committee and Dayforce subject matter experts from Benefits Administration, Central Payroll, and the Civil Service Commission. At the virtual meeting, offerors presented information about their company and proposal and responded to questions from the City. The offerors were also provided the opportunity to ask the City questions about the nature and details of the envisioned agreement. \nBased upon the content of the proposals and the additional discussions held with the offerors, the ranking remained unchanged and the evaluation committee recommended the initial contract in the amount of $375,000.00 from the Auditor’s Bond fund for Dayforce consulting and professional services be awarded to KAM Consulting Inc dba ClearCourse Consulting as the highest rated offeror. The City Auditor accepted the recommendation without any changes. \n \nClearCourse Consulting does not have an Application Programming Interface developer proposed in the list of roles requested by the City. A secondary award of $75,000.00 is made to OnActuate Consulting US Inc. to fill this need. There is planned technical work related to Dayforce and Dynamics integrations and OnActuate Consulting US Inc. is the most logical and highest rated choice as it is a certified partner with both Dayforce and Microsoft, as well as the City’s partner of record for the D365 Finance application. It will also serve as a backup for consulting in the event Clear Course Consulting does not have an available resource or the City needs to augment a project with additional staffing to fulfill roles needed in the scope of work. \n \nThe contracts would be for two (2) year terms and include the option to renew annually for three (3) times subject to annual appropriation and approval by Council. The contracts would be on a time and material basis as needed for a particular scope of work and billed at the rate cards from each of the offerors by the various project roles necessary to conduct the statement of work.  \n \nContract Compliance: \nKAM Consulting Inc dba ClearCourse Consulting: CC#-CC048137, expires 2/15/2026, D365#048137\nPrincipal place of business:  3582 Farmstone Ct Kannapolis, NC 28081 USA\nOnActuate Consulting US Inc., CC#CC-048102, expires 7/3/2026, D365# 048102\nPrincipal place of business: 1155 N.
