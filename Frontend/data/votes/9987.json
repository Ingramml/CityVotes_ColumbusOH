LLC, for the 2024 CDBG Fiber Expansion and appropriate funds from the Community Development Act Fund, provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the amount of $174,819.29.\n \nThis project involves the installation of new fiber optic cable at four (4) City Recreation Center locations - Douglas Recreation Center, Glenwood Recreation Center, Marion Franklin Recreation Center and Westgate Recreation Center.  These locations have been identified as CDBG eligible sites, that need to have fiber pathways joined together to put the fiber in service and provide accessibility to locations that are currently not accessible. This will enable enhanced data and phone capabilities and other such work as may be necessary to complete the contract.\n \nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) authorized supplemental Community Development Block Grant Coronavirus (CDBG-CV) funds for the City of Columbus. CDBG-CV funds must be used to prevent, prepare for, or respond to coronavirus, which can include installation of broadband infrastructure to increase access to high-speed internet and narrow the digital divide for low- to- moderate income residents of Columbus. Ordinance 1637-2022 authorized an amendment to the 2020 Annual Action Plan and established the appropriation of CDBG-CV Funds. A portion of these appropriations will be transferred to this project in order to fund this project.\n \nThe Department of Technology, solicited Information for Bids for the 2024 CDBG Fiber Expansion project.  The project was formally advertised on Vendor Services and BidExpress.  The city received six (6) responses on May 30, 2024.  The responding firms were:  \n \nCompany Name                                                                Bid Amount          City/State                               Majority/ODI Certification\nThayer Power and Communication                          $174,819.29                         Pataskala, OH                               MAJ                                          \nLine Construction Co.
